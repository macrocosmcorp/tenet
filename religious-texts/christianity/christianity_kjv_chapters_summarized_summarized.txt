God finished making the heavens and the earth and everything in them. On the seventh day, God rested and blessed that day because He was done with His work. In the beginning, before there were any plants on the earth, God made a mist come up from the ground to water everything. Then, God made a man out of dust from the ground and breathed life into him. God put the man in a beautiful garden called Eden and made all kinds of trees grow there, including the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. A river flowed out of Eden and divided into four rivers. God put the man in charge of taking care of the garden and told him that he could eat the fruit from any tree, except for the tree of knowledge of good and evil. He warned the man that if he ate from that tree, he would die. Then, God saw that the man was lonely, so He made all kinds of animals and birds and brought them to the man to see what he would name them. But none of the animals were a suitable companion for the man. So, while the man was sleeping, God took one of his ribs and made a woman. When the man woke up and saw her, he called her Woman because she came from him. God said that a man should leave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they would become one. The man and the woman were both naked, but they felt no shame.
This chapter is all about the people who were born after Adam and Eve. Adam lived to be 930 years old and he had a son named Seth when he was 130 years old. Seth lived to be 912 years old and he had a son named Enos when he was 105 years old. Enos lived to be 905 years old and he had a son named Cainan when he was 90 years old. Cainan lived to be 910 years old and he had a son named Mahalaleel when he was 70 years old. Mahalaleel lived to be 895 years old and he had a son named Jared when he was 65 years old. Jared lived to be 962 years old and he had a son named Enoch when he was 162 years old. Enoch lived to be 365 years old and he had a son named Methuselah when he was 65 years old. Enoch was very close to God, and one day God took him to be with Him. Methuselah lived to be 969 years old and he had a son named Lamech when he was 187 years old. Lamech lived to be 777 years old and he had a son named Noah when he was 182 years old. Noah was 500 years old when he had three sons named Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
Adam and Eve had two sons named Cain and Abel. Cain grew plants and Abel took care of sheep. One day, they both brought offerings to God. Abel's offering pleased God, but Cain's offering did not. Cain got very angry and upset. God tried to talk to Cain and asked him why he was upset. God told Cain that if he did what was right, he would be accepted. But if he did wrong, sin would be waiting at his door. Cain didn't listen and talked to Abel. They went to a field, and Cain became so angry that he killed his brother Abel. God asked Cain where Abel was, but Cain lied and said he didn't know. God was not pleased with Cain's actions and punished him. He cursed the ground so that it wouldn't produce good crops for Cain anymore. Cain was worried that others would harm him, but God promised to protect him. God put a mark on Cain to show that others should not hurt him. Cain went away and settled in the land of Nod. He had a son named Enoch and built a city named after him. Enoch had a son named Irad, who had a son named Mehujael, who had a son named Methusael, who had a son named Lamech. Lamech had two wives named Adah and Zillah. Adah had a son named Jabal, who was the father of people who lived in tents and had animals. Zillah had a son named Jubal, who was the father of musicians who played instruments. Zillah also had a son named Tubalcain, who was very skilled in working with metal. Lamech told his wives that he had killed someone and said that if Cain would be punished seven times, he would be punished seventy-seven times. Adam and Eve had another son named Seth. Seth also had a son named Enos. This was the time when people started to pray to the Lord and call upon His name.
Noah and his family were good people, and God told Noah to build a big boat called an ark. God said that in seven days, it would start raining really hard for forty days and nights, and everything on the earth would be destroyed. So Noah and his family gathered all the animals and birds and brought them into the ark. They took seven of some animals and two of others. Then the rain started and it rained for a very long time. The water covered all the land and even the mountains. Everything on the earth died, except for Noah, his family, and the animals inside the ark. They stayed in the ark for 150 days until the rain stopped.
Long ago, there were many people on the earth, and they started to have daughters. Some special beings called the sons of God saw that these daughters were beautiful and decided to marry them. But God saw that the people were doing many wrong things and their thoughts were always evil. This made God sad and He decided to destroy all the people, as well as the animals and birds, because He regretted creating them. However, there was one man named Noah who was good and obeyed God. He had three sons named Shem, Ham, and Japheth. The earth was filled with violence and corruption, so God told Noah that He was going to bring a huge flood to destroy everything. God instructed Noah to build a big boat called an ark out of a special kind of wood called gopher wood. The ark had different rooms inside and outside, and Noah had to seal it with a special substance called pitch. God told Noah the exact measurements for the ark, and Noah followed all of God's instructions. God also told Noah to bring two of every kind of animal into the ark, a male and a female, so that they would stay safe. Additionally, Noah was supposed to gather food for himself and the animals. Noah did everything just as God commanded him.
Long ago, God created the sky and the earth. At first, the earth was shapeless and empty, and it was dark everywhere. Then, the Spirit of God moved over the waters. God said, "Let there be light," and suddenly there was light! God saw that the light was good, so He separated the light from the darkness. He called the light "Day" and the darkness "Night." This marked the first day.

Next, God said, "Let's make something to separate the waters in the sky from the waters on the earth." And just like that, He made a space called the sky, which was like a big roof over the earth. God called this space "Heaven." This was the second day.

On the third day, God said, "Let all the waters on earth gather in one place, so the dry land can appear." And it happened! God named the dry land "Earth" and the waters gathered in one place "Seas." Then, God said, "Let there be plants and trees with seeds on the earth." Suddenly, the earth was filled with all kinds of plants, grass, and trees that bore fruit with their own seeds. God was pleased with what He had made.

Coming to the fourth day, God said, "Let there be lights in the sky to tell the difference between day and night." He made the sun to rule the day and the moon and stars to light up the night sky. God put them in the sky to shine on the earth and show the difference between light and darkness. God saw that this was good.

On the fifth day, God said, "Let the waters be filled with living creatures, like fish and whales, and let birds fly in the sky." Suddenly, the waters were filled with all kinds of fish and big sea creatures, and the sky was filled with birds. God blessed them and told them, "Multiply and fill the waters and the earth."

Then, on the sixth day, God said, "Let the earth be filled with living creatures, like cattle, insects, and wild animals." Just like that, the land was filled with different kinds of animals. After making all the animals, God said, "Now it is time to create humans. We will make them in our image, like us. They will have the power to rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the cattle, and the whole earth." And so, God created humans, both male and female, to take care of the earth and all living things. God blessed them and said, "Have children and become many. Fill the earth and take care of it."

God looked at everything He had made and saw that it was very good. Then came the evening and the morning, marking the end of the sixth day.
In the garden, there was a sneaky serpent who was cleverer than any other animal that God had made. The serpent asked the woman, "Did God really say that you can't eat from any tree in the garden?" The woman replied, "We can eat the fruit from all the trees except for the one in the middle of the garden. God said if we eat it or even touch it, we will die." But the serpent told the woman, "No, you won't die! God just knows that if you eat from that tree, you will become wise like Him, knowing what is good and what is bad." The woman looked at the tree and saw that its fruit looked tasty and beautiful. She wanted to become wise, so she took some fruit and ate it. Then she gave some to her husband, and he ate it too. Suddenly, their eyes were opened, and they realized they had no clothes on. They sewed together some fig leaves to cover themselves. Later, when they heard God walking in the garden, they were scared and hid among the trees. God called out to Adam, "Where are you?" Adam replied, "I heard Your voice, but I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid." God asked Adam, "Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat from the tree that I told you not to eat from?" Adam blamed the woman, saying, "It was the woman You gave me. She gave me the fruit, and I ate it." God then asked the woman, "What have you done?" The woman blamed the serpent, saying, "The serpent tricked me, so I ate the fruit." God became very angry with the serpent and said, "You are cursed more than any other animal. You will always crawl on your belly, eating dirt for the rest of your life. I will make you and the woman enemies. And her child will crush your head, while you strike his heel." Then God told the woman, "Because of what you have done, you will have pain when you give birth. You will desire your husband, and he will have authority over you." To Adam, God said, "Since you listened to your wife and ate from the tree, the ground will be cursed because of you. You will have to work hard and sweat to grow food from it. Thorns and thistles will grow, and you will eat plants from the fields. By the sweat of your brow, you will earn your food until the day you die. You were made from dust, and to dust, you will return." Adam named his wife Eve because she would be the mother of all living people. God made clothes out of animal skins for Adam and Eve to wear. Then God said, "Look, now the man has become like one of us, knowing the difference between good and evil. If he eats from the tree of life, he will live forever." So God sent the man out of the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he came. God placed Cherubims and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life.
God blessed Noah and his sons and told them to have lots of children and fill the earth. God said that animals would be afraid of them and they would have power over all the animals, birds, and fish. They could eat any animal but should not eat its blood. If any person or animal killed someone, they would be held responsible. God said that if someone killed a person, that person would be killed in return because humans are made in the image of God. God told Noah and his sons to continue having children and filling the earth. 

Then, God made a promise, a covenant, with Noah, his children, and all the animals. God promised that there would never be a flood that would destroy the earth and all its living things again. To remind everyone of this promise, God placed a rainbow in the clouds whenever it rained. When people saw the rainbow, they would remember the covenant between God, them, and all living creatures. God told Noah that the rainbow was a sign of this everlasting promise.

Noah had three sons named Shem, Ham, and Japheth. They had many descendants and their families spread all over the earth. After the flood, Noah became a farmer and planted a vineyard. One day, Noah drank too much wine and became drunk. His son Ham saw him naked and told his brothers about it. But his other sons, Shem and Japheth, respectfully covered their father's nakedness without looking at him. When Noah woke up and learned what happened, he cursed Ham's son named Canaan. He said that Canaan would become a servant to his brothers. Noah blessed God and said that Shem would be blessed and Canaan would serve him. He also said that Japheth would be successful and live in the tents of Shem, and Canaan would serve him too. Noah lived for 350 years after the flood and died when he was 950 years old.
Noah and his family were stuck on a big boat called an ark for a really long time because it rained and flooded everything. But then, God made a big wind blow and the water started going away. It took a while, but after 150 days, the water went down and the ark stopped on a mountain. 

Noah was in the ark for a while longer, and then he opened the window and let a bird called a raven fly out. The raven looked around but couldn't find a place to rest, so it came back to Noah. 

After seven days, Noah sent out a different bird called a dove. The dove flew around and looked for dry land, but it couldn't find any, so it flew back to Noah. 

Noah waited another seven days and sent out the dove again. This time, the dove came back with an olive leaf in its mouth. That meant there was land and the water was going away. 

Noah waited one more week and sent out the dove again. This time, the dove didn't come back, which meant it found a place to live. 

Then, God told Noah and his family to leave the ark along with all the animals that were with them. They all came out of the ark. 

Noah was so happy that he built an altar to thank God. He made a special offering to God, and it smelled really good. God was happy too and promised that he would never flood the whole earth again. 

He said that as long as the earth exists, we will always have seasons like spring, summer, fall, and winter. We will also have day and night, and plants will keep growing.
Long ago, everyone in the world spoke the same language. As they traveled, they found a flat land called Shinar and decided to settle there. They had an idea to build a big city with a tall tower that would reach the heavens. They wanted to be famous and stay together. God saw what they were doing and realized that if they worked together, nothing would be impossible for them. So, God decided to confuse their language, so they couldn't understand each other anymore. This caused them to scatter all over the world and stop building the city and tower. The city was called Babel because that's where God confused their language. After the story of Babel, the Bible tells us about the descendants of a man named Shem. Shem had a son named Arphaxad. Arphaxad had a son named Salah, who had a son named Eber, who had a son named Peleg, and so on. These were the generations of Shem's family. Another important person in this story is Terah. He had three sons named Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran had a son named Lot, and Terah also had a daughter-in-law named Sarai who was married to Abram. Terah, Abram, Sarai, and Lot left the land called Ur of the Chaldeans and went to a place called Haran. Terah lived for 205 years and then passed away in Haran.
Abram, his wife, and everything they had, along with Abram's nephew Lot, left Egypt and traveled to the south. Abram was very rich in animals, silver, and gold. They journeyed back to where their tent had been before, between Bethel and Hai. There, Abram went to the place where he had built an altar before and he called on the name of the LORD. Lot also had lots of animals, so much so that the land could not support both Abram and Lot. The herdsmen who took care of Abram's animals and Lot's animals started arguing. The Canaanite and Perizzite people also lived in that land. Abram didn't want any fighting, so he said to Lot, "There shouldn't be any fighting between us. We are family. Look at the whole land and choose the part you want to live in. If you go left, then I will go right. Or if you go right, then I will go left." Lot looked and saw that the plain of Jordan was well-watered, like a beautiful garden, just like the land of Egypt. Lot chose to live in that part. Abram decided to stay in the land of Canaan. Lot moved to the cities near the plain of Jordan and set up his tent near Sodom. But the people of Sodom were very wicked and did many bad things. Then the LORD said to Abram, "Look around you, from where you are, in every direction. I will give you and your descendants all the land that you see forever. I will make your descendants as numerous as the dust on the earth. Walk through the land, from one end to the other, because I will give it to you." So Abram packed up his tent and went to live in the plain of Mamre in Hebron. There, he built an altar to the LORD.
God spoke to Abram and told him to leave his home and go to a new land. God promised to make Abram into a great nation, bless him, and make his name famous. God also said that anyone who blesses Abram will be blessed, and anyone who curses him will be cursed. God said that through Abram, all families on earth will be blessed.

So Abram obeyed God and left his home with his wife Sarai and his nephew Lot. They traveled to the land of Canaan. Along the way, they came to a place called Sichem where the Canaanites lived. There, God appeared to Abram and promised that this land would belong to Abram's descendants. Abram built an altar and worshipped God.

Then Abram continued his journey and went to a mountain near Bethel. He again worshipped God and called upon His name. Abram kept moving southward. However, they soon encountered a severe famine in the land. So Abram decided to go to Egypt to find food and live there for a while. But before they reached Egypt, Abram was worried that the Egyptians would harm him because his wife Sarai was very beautiful. He told Sarai to say that she was his sister, so that they wouldn't harm him but protect her. 

As they arrived in Egypt, the Egyptians noticed Sarai's beauty and spoke highly of her to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Pharaoh took Sarai into his house and treated Abram well because of her. Pharaoh gave Abram many possessions, like sheep, oxen, donkeys, servants, and camels.

But God was not pleased with what Pharaoh did. He sent plagues upon Pharaoh and his household because Sarai was actually Abram's wife, not his sister. Pharaoh realized the truth and called Abram to explain himself. He asked Abram why he lied about Sarai being his sister and not his wife. Then Pharaoh gave back Sarai to Abram and sent them away with all their belongings.
There were four kings who made war against five other kings. These kings ruled over different cities like Sodom, Gomorrah, and others. The war took place in a valley near a salt sea. The first group of kings had been rulers over the other five for twelve years but in the thirteenth year, the five kings rebelled. In the fourteenth year, the first group of kings came and defeated many different groups of people.

Then, the first group of kings attacked the land of the Amalekites and the Amorites. The kings from Sodom, Gomorrah, and other cities went out to fight against the first group of kings along with Abram's nephew Lot. The place where the battle took place was full of slimepits. The kings from Sodom and Gomorrah ran away and fell into these slimepits. The rest of the people escaped to the mountains.

The first group of kings took all the goods from Sodom and Gomorrah and captured Lot and his belongings. However, someone who had escaped came and told Abram about this. Abram gathered his trained servants and chased after the first group of kings. He divided his group into smaller groups and attacked them at night. Abram was able to defeat them, and he took back all the goods that were taken from Sodom and Gomorrah. He also brought back Lot and the other captured people.

After Abram's victory, the king of Sodom came to meet him. Another king named Melchizedek, who was also a priest of God, came with bread and wine to bless Abram. Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of all the things he had.

Then, the king of Sodom asked Abram to give him back the captured people and keep the possessions for himself. But Abram said that he had lifted his hand and made a promise to God that he would not take anything for himself. He only allowed the men who had gone with him to take their share of the possessions.
After Noah and his family survived the big flood, they had children. The sons of Noah were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. These sons also had their own children. 

Japheth had sons named Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. Some of Gomer's sons were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. Javan had sons named Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. These sons and their families went to different lands and spoke different languages.

Ham also had sons. His sons were Cush, Mizraim, Phut, and Canaan. Cush had sons named Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabtecha. Raamah had sons named Sheba and Dedan. Cush also had a son named Nimrod, who became a powerful hunter. People said that Nimrod was a great hunter in the eyes of the Lord. Nimrod built a kingdom in the land called Babel, as well as Erech, Accad, and Calneh in Shinar. 

In that same land, Asshur built Nineveh, Rehoboth, and Calah. There was also a city called Resen between Nineveh and Calah, which was a big city. Mizraim had sons named Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, Pathrusim, Casluhim (from whom the Philistines came), and Caphtorim. Canaan had sons named Sidon, Heth, the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites.

The land of the Canaanites stretched from Sidon to Gerar all the way to Gaza. It included Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboim, and Lasha. The families of the Canaanites were spread throughout different places.

Now, let's talk about Shem. Shem is the father of all the descendants of Eber and the brother of Japheth, who is older than him. Shem had children named Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram. Aram had sons named Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. Arphaxad had a son named Salah, and Salah had a son named Eber. Eber had two sons named Peleg and Joktan. The earth was divided during Peleg's lifetime. Joktan had sons named Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, Obal, Abimael, Sheba, Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. These sons lived in the land from Mesha all the way to Sephar in the east.

These were the families of the sons of Shem. They lived in different lands, spoke different languages, and had different nations. These were the families of Noah's sons and their descendants. They spread out and formed different nations after the big flood.
When Abram was really old, God came to him and said, "I am the Almighty God. Walk with me and be perfect. I will make a special agreement between us and make you have a lot of descendants. Abram fell on his face and God said, "My agreement is with you, and you will become the father of many nations. Your name will also change from Abram to Abraham because I have made you the father of many nations. You will have many descendants and even kings will come from you. This agreement between us and your descendants will last forever. I will give your descendants the land of Canaan and be their God. Now, Abraham, you and your descendants must keep this agreement. Every male child among you must be circumcised, which means removing a small piece of skin from your body. This will be a sign of our agreement. Any male child who is not circumcised will not belong to our people. And as for your wife Sarai, I will bless her and give you a son through her. She will become the mother of nations. But Abraham fell on his face and laughed, thinking, "How can a  hundred-year-old man and a ninety-year-old woman have a child?" Then Abraham said to God, "Please let Ishmael live before you!" But God said, "No, Sarah will have a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will establish my agreement with him and his descendants. I have also blessed Ishmael and he will have many descendants. But my agreement will be with Isaac, who will be born to Sarah at this time next year." After talking to Abraham, God went away. Abraham then circumcised himself, his son Ishmael, and all the males in his household, whether they were born there or bought with money.
Sarai, who was Abram's wife, couldn't have children. But she had a servant named Hagar. Sarai said to Abram, "God is not letting me have children. Please have a child with my servant so that we can have a family." Abram listened to Sarai and did what she asked. After living in Canaan for ten years, Sarai gave Hagar to Abram as his wife. Abram and Hagar had a baby together.

When Hagar saw that she was pregnant, she started disrespecting Sarai. Sarai went to Abram and said, "This is your fault! I gave my servant to you, and now she treats me badly because she is going to have your child. May God judge between us."

Abram said to Sarai, "Hagar is your servant. Do whatever you think is best." Sarai mistreated Hagar so much that Hagar ran away. The angel of the Lord found Hagar near a water fountain in the desert. The angel asked Hagar, "Where are you going?" Hagar answered, "I ran away from my mistress Sarai because she was being mean to me."

The angel told Hagar, "Go back to Sarai and obey her." Then the angel said, "I will make your descendants multiply and become countless." The angel also told Hagar that she would have a son and should name him Ishmael, which means "God hears." The angel said that Ishmael would always be in conflict with others, and others would be in conflict with him. He would live amongst his relatives. Hagar called the Lord who spoke to her, "You are a God who sees me." She also named the well where she met the angel "Beerlahairoi." Hagar gave birth to Ishmael, and Abram named him Ishmael when he was eighty-six years old.
Abram had a vision from the Lord, who told him not to be afraid because He would protect and reward him greatly. Abram was worried because he didn't have any children, and the person who would inherit his house was someone named Eliezer. But the Lord assured Abram that Eliezer would not be his heir, but rather a child from Abram's own family would be. The Lord then took Abram outside and asked him to look up at the sky and count the stars, telling him that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars. Abram believed the Lord, and because of his belief, the Lord considered Abram to be righteous. The Lord reminded Abram that He is the one who brought him out of his homeland and promised to give him the land they were standing on as an inheritance. Abram, wanting reassurance, asked the Lord how he could know for sure that he would receive this land. The Lord then instructed Abram to bring certain animals for a ceremony. Abram followed the instructions and prepared the animals, but when birds came to eat the animal carcasses, Abram chased them away. As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep and a terrifying darkness came over him. The Lord spoke to Abram in his sleep and let him know that his descendants would be strangers in a foreign land, serving and being mistreated by them for four hundred years. But the nation that would enslave Abram's descendants would be judged by the Lord, and then Abram's descendants would come out of that land with many possessions. The Lord assured Abram that he would die in peace and be buried at an old age. However, it would take four generations for his descendants to return to this land because the people living there, called the Amorites, had not yet committed enough wrongdoing. As the sun went down and it became dark, Abram saw a smoking furnace and a burning lamp pass between the animal pieces Abram had prepared. On that same day, the Lord made a covenant with Abram, promising that his descendants would receive the land from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates River. The Lord also listed the different groups of people who currently lived in that land.
Abraham was sitting outside his tent one hot day when he saw three men standing nearby. He ran to greet them and bowed down to show respect. He asked them to stay and rest under the tree while he fetched water to wash their feet and brought them food. Abraham hurried to his wife Sarah and asked her to quickly make bread and prepare a meal. He ran to choose a young calf from his herd and had it prepared for the guests. He served them the meal and stood by them as they ate. They asked where Sarah was, and Abraham said she was in the tent. One of the men said that Sarah would have a son, even though she and Abraham were very old. Sarah overheard this from inside the tent and laughed because she thought it was impossible. The Lord asked why Sarah laughed and said that nothing is too hard for Him, and that He will return at the appointed time and Sarah will have a son. Sarah denied laughing because she was afraid, but the Lord told her that He knew she did laugh. After the meal, the men looked towards Sodom, and Abraham went with them to see them off. The Lord wondered if He should hide His plans from Abraham, knowing that Abraham would become a great nation and his descendants would follow His ways. The Lord explained that He had heard the great sin and cry for justice from Sodom and Gomorrah, and He planned to go see if it was true, and if not, He would know. The other two men left to go to Sodom, but Abraham stayed with the Lord. Abraham approached the Lord and asked if He would destroy the righteous along with the wicked. He asked if there were fifty righteous people in the city, would God spare it. Abraham pleaded for mercy and asked if there were only forty-five, forty, thirty, twenty or even ten righteous people, would God still destroy the city. The Lord agreed that if He found even ten righteous people, He would spare the city. After their conversation, the Lord left and Abraham returned to his place.
Abraham and his wife Sarah traveled to a new place called Gerar. When they arrived, Abraham told the people there that Sarah was his sister. The king of Gerar, Abimelech, heard this and took Sarah to be his wife. But God appeared to Abimelech in a dream and told him that he would die because he had taken a married woman. Abimelech explained that he didn't know Sarah was already married and had done this with good intentions. God understood and told Abimelech to give Sarah back to Abraham. If he didn't, Abimelech and his people would die. Abimelech was scared and immediately returned Sarah to Abraham. Then he talked to Abraham and asked him why he had lied about Sarah being his sister. Abraham said he did it because he thought that the people in Gerar didn't have the fear of God and would harm him if they knew she was his wife. Abimelech felt sorry and gave Abraham gifts. He also told Abraham and Sarah that they could live anywhere they wanted in his land. Abimelech then spoke to Sarah and gave her silver and told her that Abraham was like a protector for her. God listened to Abraham's prayers and healed Abimelech and his family because they had unknowingly taken Sarah. Before this, no one in Abimelech's house could have children, but God opened their wombs and they were able to have children again.
Two angels came to a city called Sodom in the evening. Lot, who lived there, saw them and went to meet them. He bowed down to them and invited them to stay at his house. But the angels said they would stay in the street. Lot urged them to come with him, so they went to his house.

Before they could rest, all the men from the city surrounded Lot's house. They called out to Lot and demanded that he bring out the two angels so they could harm them. Lot went out and tried to reason with them, begging them not to do such a wicked thing. He even offered his two daughters to them instead. But they insisted on hurting the angels.

The angels inside the house reached out and pulled Lot back inside. Then they struck the men outside with blindness so they couldn't find the door. The angels told Lot that God was going to destroy the city because of its wickedness. They instructed Lot to gather his family and leave the city.

But Lot's sons-in-law didn't believe him and thought he was joking. The next morning, the angels urgently told Lot to leave with his wife and two daughters before the destruction of the city. Lot hesitated, so the angels took hold of his hand, his wife's hand, and his daughters' hands and led them outside the city. They warned them not to look back and to escape to the mountains.

Lot pleaded with the angels to let him go to a small nearby city called Zoar instead. The angels agreed and told him to hurry to Zoar before they could do anything else. So Lot and his family went to Zoar and as soon as they arrived, God rained fire and burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah, completely destroying them and everything around.

However, against the angels' instruction, Lot's wife looked back at the destruction and instantly turned into a pillar of salt.

Abraham, who was Lot's uncle, got up early in the morning and saw the smoke rising from where Sodom and Gomorrah used to be. God remembered Abraham and saved Lot from the destruction. Lot was afraid to stay in Zoar, so he and his two daughters went to live in a cave in the mountains.

Later, Lot's older daughter said to her younger sister, "There are no men around for us to marry. Let's make our father drink wine and lie with him so that we can have children." That night, they made their father drink wine and the older daughter slept with him. The next morning, she told the younger daughter what she had done, and they made their father drink wine again. This time, the younger daughter slept with him. Both daughters became pregnant by their father.

The older daughter gave birth to a son named Moab, who became the father of the Moabite people. The younger daughter also had a son and named him Ben-ammi. He became the father of the Ammonite people.
Sarah, who was very old, had a baby boy just like God promised. They named him Isaac. When Isaac was eight days old, they followed God's command and circumcised him. Abraham was really happy and threw a big party to celebrate Isaac growing up. 

But Sarah saw that Ishmael, Abraham's other son, was making fun of Isaac. So she told Abraham to send Ishmael and his mom, Hagar, away. Abraham was sad about this, but God told him to listen to Sarah. God promised that Ishmael would become the father of a big nation too. 

Abraham gave Hagar and Ishmael some food and water and sent them away. They wandered in the wilderness, and when their water ran out, Hagar thought Ishmael would die. But God heard their cries and sent an angel to help them. The angel showed Hagar a well of water, and they both survived. Ishmael grew up in the wilderness and became a skilled archer. Hagar found him a wife from Egypt.

One day, a man named Abimelech and his chief captain came to Abraham. They could see that God was with Abraham, so they asked him to promise to always be fair and kind to them and their descendants. Abraham agreed and promised. Later, Abimelech and Abraham made a deal about a well of water that Abimelech's servants had taken. Abraham gave Abimelech some animals as a sign of their agreement.

Abraham called that place Beersheba, and he worshiped God there. After that, they lived peacefully in the land of the Philistines for a long time.
After some time, God tested Abraham. God called out to Abraham and said, "Abraham!"

Abraham replied, "Here I am."

Then God said, "Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah. There, offer him as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I will show you."

Abraham woke up early in the morning and prepared for the journey. He took his donkey, two of his servants, and Isaac his son. He also brought wood for the offering. They traveled to the place God had told them about.

On the third day, Abraham saw the place in the distance. He told his servants to stay behind with the donkey while he and Isaac went to worship. Abraham took the wood for the offering and placed it on Isaac's shoulders. He carried a fire and a knife. Both of them walked together.

Isaac looked at his father and asked, "Father, we have the fire and wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?"

Abraham replied, "God will provide the lamb for the offering, my son." So they continued walking together.

When they arrived at the place God had mentioned, Abraham built an altar and arranged the wood on it. Then he tied up Isaac and placed him on the altar, on top of the wood. Abraham reached out his hand to take the knife and sacrifice his son.

But just at that moment, the angel of the LORD called out to him from heaven, saying, "Abraham, Abraham!"

Abraham responded, "Here I am."

The angel said, "Do not harm the boy or do anything to him. Now I know that you truly fear God because you were willing to give up your son, your only son, for Me."

Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught in a thicket by its horns. He went and took the ram and offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son. Abraham named that place Jehovahjireh, which means "The LORD Will Provide." It is still called that today. The angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven and said, "Because you have obeyed my voice and did not withhold your son from Me, I swear by Myself that I will bless you greatly. I will multiply your descendants like the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will possess the cities of their enemies. And through your descendants, all the nations of the earth will be blessed, because you listened to Me."

After this, Abraham and his servants returned to Beersheba and settled there.

Then Abraham received news that his brother Nahor's wife Milcah had given birth to several children: Huz, Buz, Kemuel (who became the father of Aram), Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel. Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. In addition to these children, Nahor had a concubine named Reumah, who bore him Tebah, Gaham, Thahash, and Maachah.
Sarah was a very old lady, she was 127 years old when she passed away. She died in a place called Hebron in the land of Canaan. Abraham was very sad and came to mourn for Sarah and cry for her.
Abraham spoke to the people who lived there and said, "I am a stranger here, and I need a place to bury my wife. Can you give me a piece of land for this purpose?"
The people of that place said to Abraham, "You are an important person among us. You can choose any burial place you want. We won't stop you from burying your wife in our land."
Abraham thanked the people and bowed down before them. Then he said, "Please talk to Ephron, the man who owns the cave of Machpelah. Ask him to sell it to me as a burial place for my wife. I will pay him the right amount of money."
Ephron was there among the people of that place. He said to Abraham, "No, you are our lord. I will give you the cave and the piece of land. You can bury your wife there in front of everyone."
But Abraham wanted to make sure everything was done properly. So he said to Ephron, "Please listen to me. I want to buy the land. I will pay you the fair price for it."
Ephron answered, "The land is worth 400 shekels of silver. What is that between friends? Go ahead and bury your wife."
Abraham agreed to Ephron's offer. He weighed out 400 shekels of silver and gave it to Ephron in front of all the people. The field, the cave, and everything in it were now Abraham's property. He could bury his wife there.
Afterwards, Abraham buried Sarah in the cave. This cave was in the field of Machpelah near Mamre, the same place called Hebron in Canaan. The people of that place agreed that the field and the cave would belong to Abraham as a burial place for his wife.
After Abraham's wife Sarah died, he married another woman named Keturah. They had many children together. Abraham gave all of his possessions to his son Isaac, but he also gave some gifts to his other children and sent them away. Abraham lived for a very long time, but eventually, he died and was buried next to Sarah. After Abraham died, God blessed his son Isaac. Isaac married a woman named Rebekah, but she couldn't have children. Isaac prayed to God, and God answered his prayer. Rebekah became pregnant with twins, and they struggled inside her womb. Rebekah was worried and asked God for help. God told her that her twins would become two nations, and that the older twin would serve the younger twin. When it was time for the twins to be born, the first one came out all red and hairy, and they named him Esau. Then his brother came out, holding onto Esau's heel, and they named him Jacob. As they grew up, Esau became a skilled hunter, while Jacob preferred to stay at home. Isaac loved Esau because he liked the food he brought him, but Rebekah loved Jacob. One day, Esau came home after hunting and was very hungry. He asked Jacob to give him some of the red stew he was cooking. Jacob saw an opportunity and made a deal with Esau. He asked Esau to sell him his birthright in exchange for the stew. Esau agreed and sold his birthright to Jacob. Afterward, Jacob gave Esau the stew, and Esau ate it and left.
Abraham was old, and God had taken care of him. Abraham asked his oldest servant to find a wife for his son, Isaac. He didn't want Isaac to marry someone from the Canaanite people, so he wanted the servant to go back to their homeland and find a wife from their own family. The servant was worried that the woman might not want to come with him, so he asked if he should bring Isaac back to their homeland instead. But Abraham said that it was important for Isaac to stay where they were. Abraham believed that God would send an angel with the servant to help him find a wife for Isaac. The servant agreed and promised to do what Abraham asked. He took ten camels and traveled to the city where Abraham's family lived. When he arrived, he stopped at a well outside the city and prayed for God's help. He asked God to guide him to the right woman, and he had a specific sign in mind: if the woman offered him water and also watered his camels, then he would know that she was the one God chose for Isaac. Before he finished praying, a woman named Rebekah came to the well. She was beautiful and kind. The servant asked her for a drink of water, and she gave him water from her pitcher. Then, without being asked, she watered all his camels. The servant watched with amazement. He knew that God had led him to Rebekah. He gave her some jewelry and asked about her family. She told him that she was from the same family as Abraham, and she had plenty of room in her home for him and his camels. The servant was overjoyed and thanked God for leading him to Rebekah. He went to her family's house and told them everything that had happened. Rebekah's brother and father agreed to let her go with the servant to marry Isaac. They all celebrated and had a meal together. The next morning, the servant wanted to leave and bring Rebekah to Isaac. But her family asked if she could stay with them for a little while longer. The servant insisted that he had to go, and they asked Rebekah if she wanted to leave with him. She said yes, and they all blessed her and wished her well. Rebekah and her maids traveled with the servant and his men back to Isaac. Meanwhile, Isaac was out in a field, and when he saw the camels coming, he knew something exciting was happening. Rebekah saw Isaac and got off her camel. She asked the servant who that man in the field was, and the servant told her it was Isaac. She covered her face with a veil and went to meet him. The servant told Isaac all that had happened, and Isaac brought Rebekah into his mother's tent and married her. Isaac loved Rebekah, and she brought him comfort after his mother passed away.
There was a famine in the land where Isaac lived. He went to a king called Abimelech. God appeared to Isaac and told him not to go to Egypt, but to stay in the land that God would show him. God promised to bless Isaac and his children, and give them all the countries in that land. God said that Isaac's descendants would become as many as the stars in the sky and that all nations would be blessed through them. Isaac lived in Gerar. The people there asked Isaac about his wife, and Isaac said she was his sister because he was afraid they might kill him if they knew she was his wife. After some time, the king saw Isaac playing with his wife and realized that she was actually his wife. The king asked Isaac why he lied, and Isaac explained that he was afraid for his own safety. The king warned his people not to harm Isaac or his wife. Isaac planted crops and God blessed him with a hundred times more harvest than he expected. Isaac became very rich, owning many animals and servants. The people of Gerar became jealous of Isaac's wealth. They stopped up all the wells that had been dug by Isaac's father, Abraham. So, Isaac moved to the valley of Gerar and dug again the wells that were filled with Earth. Isaac's workers found a well with flowing water. But the people of Gerar argued with Isaac's workers, claiming it was their water. Isaac named that well "Esek," meaning "argument." Then they dug another well, but they also argued over it. Isaac named it "Sitnah," meaning "opposition." Isaac moved on and dug another well, and this time there was no argument. He called it "Rehoboth," meaning "wide open spaces," and said God had made room for them to be fruitful in the land. Isaac went to Beersheba, and God appeared to him at night, promising to bless him and multiply his descendants because of Abraham. Isaac built an altar and worshiped God there while his servants dug a well. The king and his friends came to Isaac and said they wanted to make a covenant with him because they saw God blessing him. They had a feast together and made an agreement, then they left in peace. On the same day, Isaac's servants told him about the well they had dug, and he named it "Shebah" which means "oath." Esau, Isaac's son, married two women from the Hittites, which made his parents upset.
Isaac called his son Jacob and blessed him. He told Jacob not to marry any girls from the Canaanite people. He wanted Jacob to go to his grandfather's house in Padanaram and find a wife from his uncle Laban's family. Isaac asked God Almighty to bless Jacob, make him very fruitful, and increase his descendants. He also asked God to give Jacob and his descendants the same blessings that were promised to Abraham. Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Padanaram to find a wife.

When Jacob left, Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to find a wife from Padanaram. Esau realized that his own marriages to the Canaanite women were not pleasing to their father, Isaac. So, he went to Ishmael, his uncle, and married Mahalath, Ishmael's daughter.

As Jacob traveled towards Haran, he found a certain place to spend the night. He took some stones and used them as a pillow to sleep on. While he was sleeping, Jacob had a dream. He saw a ladder that reached from the earth all the way to heaven. Angels were going up and down the ladder. The Lord stood at the top of the ladder and said that He was the God of Jacob's father, Abraham, and his father, Isaac. God promised to give Jacob the land he was sleeping on and to bless his descendants, who would become as numerous as the dust of the earth. God promised to be with Jacob wherever he went and to bring him back to this land. Jacob woke up and said, "Surely the Lord is in this place, and I didn't know it." He was afraid and said that it was the house of God and the gate of heaven.

Early in the morning, Jacob got up and took the stone he had used as a pillow. He set it up as a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. Jacob named the place Bethel. Before, it was called Luz. Then, Jacob made a vow to God. He promised that if God protected him on his journey and brought him back safely to his father's house, then the Lord would be his God. Jacob also said that the stone pillar he made would be God's house, and he promised to give a tenth of all that God gave him.
Isaac, who was very old and couldn't see well, called his oldest son Esau. He told him to go hunting and bring back some tasty food that he could eat. Isaac wanted to bless Esau before he died. Isaac's wife, Rebekah, overheard this conversation and told their other son Jacob about it. She told Jacob to go and get two young goats so she could prepare a meal for Isaac. Jacob was worried that his father would realize he wasn't Esau and curse him instead of blessing him, but Rebekah assured him that she would take the blame if anything went wrong. Jacob brought the goats to his mother, and she cooked them and dressed Jacob in Esau's clothes. She also put goat skins on Jacob's hands and neck to make him feel hairy like Esau. Finally, she gave Jacob the food and sent him to Isaac. Jacob approached Isaac and pretended to be Esau. Isaac questioned him, but Jacob deceived him with his voice and hands. Isaac believed that Jacob was Esau and blessed him. He gave Jacob a blessing with lots of good things, authority over his brothers, and the promise that those who blessed him would also be blessed. Just as Jacob left Isaac's presence, Esau returned from hunting with his own food. He went to Isaac and asked him to bless him too. Isaac was shocked and realized that he had already blessed Jacob, who had tricked him. Esau cried out in bitterness and asked Isaac if he had any blessings left for him. Isaac told Esau about the blessings he had already given to Jacob and said that he couldn't take them back. Esau was angry at Jacob and planned to kill him after their father died. When Rebekah found out about Esau's plan, she warned Jacob to run away to her brother Laban in Haran. She told Jacob to stay with Laban until Esau's anger cooled down. Rebekah didn't want to lose both of her sons in one day. She also told Isaac that she was unhappy with the women Esau had married, and if Jacob married one of the local women, it would make her life even worse.
Rachel was sad because she couldn't have any children. She asked her husband Jacob to give her children or else she would die. Jacob was mad at Rachel and told her that he couldn't give her children because only God could. Then Rachel told Jacob to have children with her servant Bilhah, so that she could have children through her. Jacob listened to Rachel and had children with Bilhah, and she gave birth to a son named Dan and later another son named Naphtali. 

Then Leah saw that she couldn't have any more children, so she gave her servant Zilpah to Jacob as a wife. Zilpah gave birth to a son. Leah named him Gad. Zilpah had another son, and Leah named him Asher. 

One day, Reuben, Jacob's oldest son, found some special plants called mandrakes in the field and gave them to his mother Leah. Rachel wanted the mandrakes, so she asked Leah to give them to her. But Leah got mad at Rachel and said no because Rachel had already taken her husband Jacob. Rachel told Leah that she could have Jacob for one night in exchange for the mandrakes. Jacob agreed and slept with Leah. As a result, Leah became pregnant and gave birth to another son named Issachar. A while later, Leah had another son named Zebulun and then a daughter named Dinah. 

God thought about Rachel and opened her womb. Rachel became pregnant and gave birth to a son named Joseph. She was very happy and said God had taken away her sadness. Rachel named her son Joseph and said that God would give her another son in the future. 

After Joseph was born, Jacob wanted to go back to his own country. He asked his father-in-law Laban to give him his wives and children so that they could leave. Laban wanted Jacob to stay because he believed that Jacob's presence had brought him blessings. Laban asked Jacob what he wanted in return for his service. Jacob told Laban that he didn't need anything. Instead, he asked for all the speckled and spotted cattle from Laban's flock as his payment. Jacob had a plan to increase his own flock. Laban agreed, so Jacob separated the speckled and spotted livestock from the rest of the flock and put them in front of the stronger cattle when they mated. As a result, Jacob's flock grew bigger and stronger, and he became very rich with many animals and servants.
Jacob traveled to a faraway land and saw a well in a field. There were three groups of sheep lying next to the well, waiting to drink water. There was a big stone covering the well. The shepherds would remove the stone and water the sheep, and then put the stone back in its place. Jacob asked the shepherds where they were from, and they said they were from Haran. Jacob asked if they knew Laban, and they said they did. Jacob then asked if Laban was doing well, and they said he was and that Laban's daughter Rachel was coming with the sheep. It was still early in the day, and the shepherds explained that they couldn't water the sheep until all the flocks were gathered together and the stone was removed from the well. While they were talking, Rachel arrived with her father's sheep. Jacob went over and removed the stone from the well, and then watered Laban's flock. Jacob was so happy to see Rachel that he kissed her and cried. He told Rachel that he was her relative, and she ran to tell her father. Laban heard the news and went to meet Jacob. He hugged and kissed Jacob and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban everything that had happened. Laban said to Jacob, "You are my relative, so you shouldn't work for me for nothing. Tell me, what do you want as your wages?" Laban had two daughters, Leah and Rachel. Leah had tender eyes, but Rachel was beautiful. Jacob loved Rachel and offered to work for Laban for seven years in exchange for marrying Rachel. Laban agreed, saying it was better for Jacob to marry Rachel than someone else. So Jacob worked for Laban for seven years, but it seemed like a short time because he loved Rachel so much. When the seven years were over, Jacob asked Laban to give him Rachel as his wife. Laban gathered all the people of the place and they had a big feast. That night, however, Laban tricked Jacob and gave him Leah instead of Rachel. Laban also gave Leah his servant Zilpah as her maid. When Jacob realized what had happened, he confronted Laban and asked why he had deceived him. Laban explained that in their country, it was not allowed to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older daughter. He told Jacob to fulfill the marriage week with Leah, and then he could also marry Rachel if he worked for him for seven more years. Jacob agreed to this arrangement and completed the marriage week with Leah. Laban then gave Rachel to Jacob as his wife as well. Rachel had a servant named Bilhah, who became her maid. Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah and continued to work for Laban for another seven years. But Rachel could not have children, while Leah could. Leah had a son and named him Reuben, saying that God had seen her suffering and that her husband would love her now. Leah had another son and named him Simeon, saying that God had heard that she was hated and had given her another son. She had a third son, whom she named Levi, believing that now her husband would be joined to her since she had given him three sons. Leah had another son and named him Judah, saying that she would praise the Lord. After that, she stopped having children.
