0,Genesis,1,"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness [was] upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that [it was] good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which [were] under the firmament from the waters which [were] above the firmament: and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry [land] appear: and it was so. And God called the dry [land] Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that [it was] good. And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, [and] the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed [is] in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, [and] herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed [was] in itself, after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good. And the evening and the morning were the third day. And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also. And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that [it was] good. And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl [that] may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good. And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his [own] image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which [is] upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which [is] the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein [there is] life, [I have given] every green herb for meat: and it was so. And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, [it was] very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.","God finished making the heavens and the earth and everything in them. On the seventh day, God rested and blessed that day because He was done with His work. In the beginning, before there were any plants on the earth, God made a mist come up from the ground to water everything. Then, God made a man out of dust from the ground and breathed life into him. God put the man in a beautiful garden called Eden and made all kinds of trees grow there, including the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. A river flowed out of Eden and divided into four rivers. God put the man in charge of taking care of the garden and told him that he could eat the fruit from any tree, except for the tree of knowledge of good and evil. He warned the man that if he ate from that tree, he would die. Then, God saw that the man was lonely, so He made all kinds of animals and birds and brought them to the man to see what he would name them. But none of the animals were a suitable companion for the man. So, while the man was sleeping, God took one of his ribs and made a woman. When the man woke up and saw her, he called her Woman because she came from him. God said that a man should leave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they would become one. The man and the woman were both naked, but they felt no shame."
1,Genesis,2,"Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. These [are] the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens, And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and [there was] not a man to till the ground. But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. And the LORD God formed man [of] the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads. The name of the first [is] Pison: that [is] it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where [there is] gold; And the gold of that land [is] good: there [is] bdellium and the onyx stone. And the name of the second river [is] Gihon: the same [is] it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. And the name of the third river [is] Hiddekel: that [is] it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river [is] Euphrates. And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. And the LORD God said, [It is] not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought [them] unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that [was] the name thereof. And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him. And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. And Adam said, This [is] now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.","This chapter is all about the people who were born after Adam and Eve. Adam lived to be 930 years old and he had a son named Seth when he was 130 years old. Seth lived to be 912 years old and he had a son named Enos when he was 105 years old. Enos lived to be 905 years old and he had a son named Cainan when he was 90 years old. Cainan lived to be 910 years old and he had a son named Mahalaleel when he was 70 years old. Mahalaleel lived to be 895 years old and he had a son named Jared when he was 65 years old. Jared lived to be 962 years old and he had a son named Enoch when he was 162 years old. Enoch lived to be 365 years old and he had a son named Methuselah when he was 65 years old. Enoch was very close to God, and one day God took him to be with Him. Methuselah lived to be 969 years old and he had a son named Lamech when he was 187 years old. Lamech lived to be 777 years old and he had a son named Noah when he was 182 years old. Noah was 500 years old when he had three sons named Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
2,Genesis,3,"Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. And when the woman saw that the tree [was] good for food, and that it [was] pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make [one] wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they [were] naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where [art] thou? And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I [was] naked; and I hid myself. And he said, Who told thee that thou [wast] naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest [to be] with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. And the LORD God said unto the woman, What [is] this [that] thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou [art] cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire [shall be] to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed [is] the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat [of] it all the days of thy life; Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou [art], and unto dust shalt thou return. And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them. And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.","Adam and Eve had two sons named Cain and Abel. Cain grew plants and Abel took care of sheep. One day, they both brought offerings to God. Abel's offering pleased God, but Cain's offering did not. Cain got very angry and upset. God tried to talk to Cain and asked him why he was upset. God told Cain that if he did what was right, he would be accepted. But if he did wrong, sin would be waiting at his door. Cain didn't listen and talked to Abel. They went to a field, and Cain became so angry that he killed his brother Abel. God asked Cain where Abel was, but Cain lied and said he didn't know. God was not pleased with Cain's actions and punished him. He cursed the ground so that it wouldn't produce good crops for Cain anymore. Cain was worried that others would harm him, but God promised to protect him. God put a mark on Cain to show that others should not hurt him. Cain went away and settled in the land of Nod. He had a son named Enoch and built a city named after him. Enoch had a son named Irad, who had a son named Mehujael, who had a son named Methusael, who had a son named Lamech. Lamech had two wives named Adah and Zillah. Adah had a son named Jabal, who was the father of people who lived in tents and had animals. Zillah had a son named Jubal, who was the father of musicians who played instruments. Zillah also had a son named Tubalcain, who was very skilled in working with metal. Lamech told his wives that he had killed someone and said that if Cain would be punished seven times, he would be punished seventy-seven times. Adam and Eve had another son named Seth. Seth also had a son named Enos. This was the time when people started to pray to the Lord and call upon His name."
3,Genesis,4,"And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD. And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering: But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee [shall be] his desire, and thou shalt rule over him. And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. And the LORD said unto Cain, Where [is] Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: [Am] I my brother's keeper? And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground. And now [art] thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth. And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment [is] greater than I can bear. Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, [that] every one that findeth me shall slay me. And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him. And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch. And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech. And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one [was] Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and [of such as have] cattle. And his brother's name [was] Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ. And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain [was] Naamah. And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt. If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold. And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, [said she], hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew. And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.","Noah and his family were good people, and God told Noah to build a big boat called an ark. God said that in seven days, it would start raining really hard for forty days and nights, and everything on the earth would be destroyed. So Noah and his family gathered all the animals and birds and brought them into the ark. They took seven of some animals and two of others. Then the rain started and it rained for a very long time. The water covered all the land and even the mountains. Everything on the earth died, except for Noah, his family, and the animals inside the ark. They stayed in the ark for 150 days until the rain stopped."
4,Genesis,5,"This [is] the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him; Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created. And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat [a son] in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth: And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters: And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died. And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos: And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters: And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died. And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan: And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters: And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died. And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel: And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters: And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died. And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared: And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters: And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died. And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch: And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died. And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years: And Enoch walked with God: and he [was] not; for God took him. And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech: And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters: And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died. And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son: And he called his name Noah, saying, This [same] shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed. And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters: And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died. And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.","Long ago, there were many people on the earth, and they started to have daughters. Some special beings called the sons of God saw that these daughters were beautiful and decided to marry them. But God saw that the people were doing many wrong things and their thoughts were always evil. This made God sad and He decided to destroy all the people, as well as the animals and birds, because He regretted creating them. However, there was one man named Noah who was good and obeyed God. He had three sons named Shem, Ham, and Japheth. The earth was filled with violence and corruption, so God told Noah that He was going to bring a huge flood to destroy everything. God instructed Noah to build a big boat called an ark out of a special kind of wood called gopher wood. The ark had different rooms inside and outside, and Noah had to seal it with a special substance called pitch. God told Noah the exact measurements for the ark, and Noah followed all of God's instructions. God also told Noah to bring two of every kind of animal into the ark, a male and a female, so that they would stay safe. Additionally, Noah was supposed to gather food for himself and the animals. Noah did everything just as God commanded him."
5,Genesis,6,"And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they [were] fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also [is] flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years. There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare [children] to them, the same [became] mighty men which [were] of old, men of renown. And GOD saw that the wickedness of man [was] great in the earth, and [that] every imagination of the thoughts of his heart [was] only evil continually. And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them. But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD. These [are] the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man [and] perfect in his generations, [and] Noah walked with God. And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth. And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. And this [is the fashion] which thou shalt make it [of]: The length of the ark [shall be] three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; [with] lower, second, and third [stories] shalt thou make it. And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein [is] the breath of life, from under heaven; [and] every thing that [is] in the earth shall die. But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every [sort] shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep [them] alive with thee; they shall be male and female. Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every [sort] shall come unto thee, to keep [them] alive. And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather [it] to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.","Long ago, God created the sky and the earth. At first, the earth was shapeless and empty, and it was dark everywhere. Then, the Spirit of God moved over the waters. God said, ""Let there be light,"" and suddenly there was light! God saw that the light was good, so He separated the light from the darkness. He called the light ""Day"" and the darkness ""Night."" This marked the first day.

Next, God said, ""Let's make something to separate the waters in the sky from the waters on the earth."" And just like that, He made a space called the sky, which was like a big roof over the earth. God called this space ""Heaven."" This was the second day.

On the third day, God said, ""Let all the waters on earth gather in one place, so the dry land can appear."" And it happened! God named the dry land ""Earth"" and the waters gathered in one place ""Seas."" Then, God said, ""Let there be plants and trees with seeds on the earth."" Suddenly, the earth was filled with all kinds of plants, grass, and trees that bore fruit with their own seeds. God was pleased with what He had made.

Coming to the fourth day, God said, ""Let there be lights in the sky to tell the difference between day and night."" He made the sun to rule the day and the moon and stars to light up the night sky. God put them in the sky to shine on the earth and show the difference between light and darkness. God saw that this was good.

On the fifth day, God said, ""Let the waters be filled with living creatures, like fish and whales, and let birds fly in the sky."" Suddenly, the waters were filled with all kinds of fish and big sea creatures, and the sky was filled with birds. God blessed them and told them, ""Multiply and fill the waters and the earth.""

Then, on the sixth day, God said, ""Let the earth be filled with living creatures, like cattle, insects, and wild animals."" Just like that, the land was filled with different kinds of animals. After making all the animals, God said, ""Now it is time to create humans. We will make them in our image, like us. They will have the power to rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the cattle, and the whole earth."" And so, God created humans, both male and female, to take care of the earth and all living things. God blessed them and said, ""Have children and become many. Fill the earth and take care of it.""

God looked at everything He had made and saw that it was very good. Then came the evening and the morning, marking the end of the sixth day."
6,Genesis,7,"And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation. Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that [are] not clean by two, the male and his female. Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth. And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him. And Noah [was] six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth. And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. Of clean beasts, and of beasts that [are] not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah. And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth. In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort. And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein [is] the breath of life. And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in. And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that [were] under the whole heaven, were covered. Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man: All in whose nostrils [was] the breath of life, of all that [was] in the dry [land], died. And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained [alive], and they that [were] with him in the ark. And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.","In the garden, there was a sneaky serpent who was cleverer than any other animal that God had made. The serpent asked the woman, ""Did God really say that you can't eat from any tree in the garden?"" The woman replied, ""We can eat the fruit from all the trees except for the one in the middle of the garden. God said if we eat it or even touch it, we will die."" But the serpent told the woman, ""No, you won't die! God just knows that if you eat from that tree, you will become wise like Him, knowing what is good and what is bad."" The woman looked at the tree and saw that its fruit looked tasty and beautiful. She wanted to become wise, so she took some fruit and ate it. Then she gave some to her husband, and he ate it too. Suddenly, their eyes were opened, and they realized they had no clothes on. They sewed together some fig leaves to cover themselves. Later, when they heard God walking in the garden, they were scared and hid among the trees. God called out to Adam, ""Where are you?"" Adam replied, ""I heard Your voice, but I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid."" God asked Adam, ""Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat from the tree that I told you not to eat from?"" Adam blamed the woman, saying, ""It was the woman You gave me. She gave me the fruit, and I ate it."" God then asked the woman, ""What have you done?"" The woman blamed the serpent, saying, ""The serpent tricked me, so I ate the fruit."" God became very angry with the serpent and said, ""You are cursed more than any other animal. You will always crawl on your belly, eating dirt for the rest of your life. I will make you and the woman enemies. And her child will crush your head, while you strike his heel."" Then God told the woman, ""Because of what you have done, you will have pain when you give birth. You will desire your husband, and he will have authority over you."" To Adam, God said, ""Since you listened to your wife and ate from the tree, the ground will be cursed because of you. You will have to work hard and sweat to grow food from it. Thorns and thistles will grow, and you will eat plants from the fields. By the sweat of your brow, you will earn your food until the day you die. You were made from dust, and to dust, you will return."" Adam named his wife Eve because she would be the mother of all living people. God made clothes out of animal skins for Adam and Eve to wear. Then God said, ""Look, now the man has become like one of us, knowing the difference between good and evil. If he eats from the tree of life, he will live forever."" So God sent the man out of the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he came. God placed Cherubims and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life."
7,Genesis,8,"And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that [was] with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged; The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated. And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth [month], on the first [day] of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made: And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters [were] on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark. And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth [was] an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more. And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first [month], the first [day] of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry. And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried. And God spake unto Noah, saying, Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee. Bring forth with thee every living thing that [is] with thee, of all flesh, [both] of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him: Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, [and] whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark. And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart [is] evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.","God blessed Noah and his sons and told them to have lots of children and fill the earth. God said that animals would be afraid of them and they would have power over all the animals, birds, and fish. They could eat any animal but should not eat its blood. If any person or animal killed someone, they would be held responsible. God said that if someone killed a person, that person would be killed in return because humans are made in the image of God. God told Noah and his sons to continue having children and filling the earth. 

Then, God made a promise, a covenant, with Noah, his children, and all the animals. God promised that there would never be a flood that would destroy the earth and all its living things again. To remind everyone of this promise, God placed a rainbow in the clouds whenever it rained. When people saw the rainbow, they would remember the covenant between God, them, and all living creatures. God told Noah that the rainbow was a sign of this everlasting promise.

Noah had three sons named Shem, Ham, and Japheth. They had many descendants and their families spread all over the earth. After the flood, Noah became a farmer and planted a vineyard. One day, Noah drank too much wine and became drunk. His son Ham saw him naked and told his brothers about it. But his other sons, Shem and Japheth, respectfully covered their father's nakedness without looking at him. When Noah woke up and learned what happened, he cursed Ham's son named Canaan. He said that Canaan would become a servant to his brothers. Noah blessed God and said that Shem would be blessed and Canaan would serve him. He also said that Japheth would be successful and live in the tents of Shem, and Canaan would serve him too. Noah lived for 350 years after the flood and died when he was 950 years old."
8,Genesis,9,"And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth [upon] the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered. Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. But flesh with the life thereof, [which is] the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man. Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man. And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein. And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; And with every living creature that [is] with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. And God said, This [is] the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that [is] with you, for perpetual generations: I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: And I will remember my covenant, which [is] between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that [is] upon the earth. And God said unto Noah, This [is] the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that [is] upon the earth. And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham [is] the father of Canaan. These [are] the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread. And Noah began [to be] an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid [it] upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces [were] backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. And he said, Cursed [be] Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. And he said, Blessed [be] the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.","Noah and his family were stuck on a big boat called an ark for a really long time because it rained and flooded everything. But then, God made a big wind blow and the water started going away. It took a while, but after 150 days, the water went down and the ark stopped on a mountain. 

Noah was in the ark for a while longer, and then he opened the window and let a bird called a raven fly out. The raven looked around but couldn't find a place to rest, so it came back to Noah. 

After seven days, Noah sent out a different bird called a dove. The dove flew around and looked for dry land, but it couldn't find any, so it flew back to Noah. 

Noah waited another seven days and sent out the dove again. This time, the dove came back with an olive leaf in its mouth. That meant there was land and the water was going away. 

Noah waited one more week and sent out the dove again. This time, the dove didn't come back, which meant it found a place to live. 

Then, God told Noah and his family to leave the ark along with all the animals that were with them. They all came out of the ark. 

Noah was so happy that he built an altar to thank God. He made a special offering to God, and it smelled really good. God was happy too and promised that he would never flood the whole earth again. 

He said that as long as the earth exists, we will always have seasons like spring, summer, fall, and winter. We will also have day and night, and plants will keep growing."
9,Genesis,10,"Now these [are] the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood. The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations. And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan. And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan. And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same [is] a great city. And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim. And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth, And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad. And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha. These [are] the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, [and] in their nations. Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were [children] born. The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one [was] Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name [was] Joktan. And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these [were] the sons of Joktan. And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east. These [are] the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. These [are] the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.","Long ago, everyone in the world spoke the same language. As they traveled, they found a flat land called Shinar and decided to settle there. They had an idea to build a big city with a tall tower that would reach the heavens. They wanted to be famous and stay together. God saw what they were doing and realized that if they worked together, nothing would be impossible for them. So, God decided to confuse their language, so they couldn't understand each other anymore. This caused them to scatter all over the world and stop building the city and tower. The city was called Babel because that's where God confused their language. After the story of Babel, the Bible tells us about the descendants of a man named Shem. Shem had a son named Arphaxad. Arphaxad had a son named Salah, who had a son named Eber, who had a son named Peleg, and so on. These were the generations of Shem's family. Another important person in this story is Terah. He had three sons named Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran had a son named Lot, and Terah also had a daughter-in-law named Sarai who was married to Abram. Terah, Abram, Sarai, and Lot left the land called Ur of the Chaldeans and went to a place called Haran. Terah lived for 205 years and then passed away in Haran."
10,Genesis,11,"And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top [may reach] unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. And the LORD said, Behold, the people [is] one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. These [are] the generations of Shem: Shem [was] an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood: And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah: And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters. And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters. And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters. And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters. And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Now these [are] the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot. And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife [was] Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. But Sarai was barren; she [had] no child. And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.","Abram, his wife, and everything they had, along with Abram's nephew Lot, left Egypt and traveled to the south. Abram was very rich in animals, silver, and gold. They journeyed back to where their tent had been before, between Bethel and Hai. There, Abram went to the place where he had built an altar before and he called on the name of the LORD. Lot also had lots of animals, so much so that the land could not support both Abram and Lot. The herdsmen who took care of Abram's animals and Lot's animals started arguing. The Canaanite and Perizzite people also lived in that land. Abram didn't want any fighting, so he said to Lot, ""There shouldn't be any fighting between us. We are family. Look at the whole land and choose the part you want to live in. If you go left, then I will go right. Or if you go right, then I will go left."" Lot looked and saw that the plain of Jordan was well-watered, like a beautiful garden, just like the land of Egypt. Lot chose to live in that part. Abram decided to stay in the land of Canaan. Lot moved to the cities near the plain of Jordan and set up his tent near Sodom. But the people of Sodom were very wicked and did many bad things. Then the LORD said to Abram, ""Look around you, from where you are, in every direction. I will give you and your descendants all the land that you see forever. I will make your descendants as numerous as the dust on the earth. Walk through the land, from one end to the other, because I will give it to you."" So Abram packed up his tent and went to live in the plain of Mamre in Hebron. There, he built an altar to the LORD."
11,Genesis,12,"Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee: And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram [was] seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran. And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite [was] then in the land. And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him. And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, [having] Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD. And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south. And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine [was] grievous in the land. And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou [art] a fair woman to look upon: Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This [is] his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive. Say, I pray thee, thou [art] my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee. And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she [was] very fair. The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels. And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife. And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What [is] this [that] thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she [was] thy wife? Why saidst thou, She [is] my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take [her], and go thy way. And Pharaoh commanded [his] men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.","God spoke to Abram and told him to leave his home and go to a new land. God promised to make Abram into a great nation, bless him, and make his name famous. God also said that anyone who blesses Abram will be blessed, and anyone who curses him will be cursed. God said that through Abram, all families on earth will be blessed.

So Abram obeyed God and left his home with his wife Sarai and his nephew Lot. They traveled to the land of Canaan. Along the way, they came to a place called Sichem where the Canaanites lived. There, God appeared to Abram and promised that this land would belong to Abram's descendants. Abram built an altar and worshipped God.

Then Abram continued his journey and went to a mountain near Bethel. He again worshipped God and called upon His name. Abram kept moving southward. However, they soon encountered a severe famine in the land. So Abram decided to go to Egypt to find food and live there for a while. But before they reached Egypt, Abram was worried that the Egyptians would harm him because his wife Sarai was very beautiful. He told Sarai to say that she was his sister, so that they wouldn't harm him but protect her. 

As they arrived in Egypt, the Egyptians noticed Sarai's beauty and spoke highly of her to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Pharaoh took Sarai into his house and treated Abram well because of her. Pharaoh gave Abram many possessions, like sheep, oxen, donkeys, servants, and camels.

But God was not pleased with what Pharaoh did. He sent plagues upon Pharaoh and his household because Sarai was actually Abram's wife, not his sister. Pharaoh realized the truth and called Abram to explain himself. He asked Abram why he lied about Sarai being his sister and not his wife. Then Pharaoh gave back Sarai to Abram and sent them away with all their belongings."
12,Genesis,13,"And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south. And Abram [was] very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai; Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD. And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together. And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land. And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we [be] brethren. [Is] not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if [thou wilt take] the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if [thou depart] to the right hand, then I will go to the left. And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it [was] well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, [even] as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar. Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other. Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched [his] tent toward Sodom. But the men of Sodom [were] wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly. And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever. And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, [then] shall thy seed also be numbered. Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee. Then Abram removed [his] tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which [is] in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.","There were four kings who made war against five other kings. These kings ruled over different cities like Sodom, Gomorrah, and others. The war took place in a valley near a salt sea. The first group of kings had been rulers over the other five for twelve years but in the thirteenth year, the five kings rebelled. In the fourteenth year, the first group of kings came and defeated many different groups of people.

Then, the first group of kings attacked the land of the Amalekites and the Amorites. The kings from Sodom, Gomorrah, and other cities went out to fight against the first group of kings along with Abram's nephew Lot. The place where the battle took place was full of slimepits. The kings from Sodom and Gomorrah ran away and fell into these slimepits. The rest of the people escaped to the mountains.

The first group of kings took all the goods from Sodom and Gomorrah and captured Lot and his belongings. However, someone who had escaped came and told Abram about this. Abram gathered his trained servants and chased after the first group of kings. He divided his group into smaller groups and attacked them at night. Abram was able to defeat them, and he took back all the goods that were taken from Sodom and Gomorrah. He also brought back Lot and the other captured people.

After Abram's victory, the king of Sodom came to meet him. Another king named Melchizedek, who was also a priest of God, came with bread and wine to bless Abram. Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of all the things he had.

Then, the king of Sodom asked Abram to give him back the captured people and keep the possessions for himself. But Abram said that he had lifted his hand and made a promise to God that he would not take anything for himself. He only allowed the men who had gone with him to take their share of the possessions."
13,Genesis,14,"And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations; [That these] made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar. All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea. Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled. And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that [were] with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim, And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which [is] by the wilderness. And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which [is] Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar. And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same [is] Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim; With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five. And the vale of Siddim [was full of] slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain. And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way. And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed. And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these [were] confederate with Abram. And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained [servants], born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued [them] unto Dan. And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which [is] on the left hand of Damascus. And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people. And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that [were] with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which [is] the king's dale. And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he [was] the priest of the most high God. And he blessed him, and said, Blessed [be] Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth: And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all. And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself. And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth, That I will not [take] from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that [is] thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich: Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.","After Noah and his family survived the big flood, they had children. The sons of Noah were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. These sons also had their own children. 

Japheth had sons named Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. Some of Gomer's sons were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. Javan had sons named Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. These sons and their families went to different lands and spoke different languages.

Ham also had sons. His sons were Cush, Mizraim, Phut, and Canaan. Cush had sons named Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabtecha. Raamah had sons named Sheba and Dedan. Cush also had a son named Nimrod, who became a powerful hunter. People said that Nimrod was a great hunter in the eyes of the Lord. Nimrod built a kingdom in the land called Babel, as well as Erech, Accad, and Calneh in Shinar. 

In that same land, Asshur built Nineveh, Rehoboth, and Calah. There was also a city called Resen between Nineveh and Calah, which was a big city. Mizraim had sons named Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, Pathrusim, Casluhim (from whom the Philistines came), and Caphtorim. Canaan had sons named Sidon, Heth, the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites.

The land of the Canaanites stretched from Sidon to Gerar all the way to Gaza. It included Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboim, and Lasha. The families of the Canaanites were spread throughout different places.

Now, let's talk about Shem. Shem is the father of all the descendants of Eber and the brother of Japheth, who is older than him. Shem had children named Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram. Aram had sons named Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. Arphaxad had a son named Salah, and Salah had a son named Eber. Eber had two sons named Peleg and Joktan. The earth was divided during Peleg's lifetime. Joktan had sons named Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, Obal, Abimael, Sheba, Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. These sons lived in the land from Mesha all the way to Sephar in the east.

These were the families of the sons of Shem. They lived in different lands, spoke different languages, and had different nations. These were the families of Noah's sons and their descendants. They spread out and formed different nations after the big flood."
14,Genesis,15,"After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I [am] thy shield, [and] thy exceeding great reward. And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house [is] this Eliezer of Damascus? And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir. And, behold, the word of the LORD [came] unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be. And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness. And he said unto him, I [am] the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it. And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not. And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away. And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him. And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land [that is] not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance. And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites [is] not yet full. And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces. In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates: The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims, And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.","When Abram was really old, God came to him and said, ""I am the Almighty God. Walk with me and be perfect. I will make a special agreement between us and make you have a lot of descendants. Abram fell on his face and God said, ""My agreement is with you, and you will become the father of many nations. Your name will also change from Abram to Abraham because I have made you the father of many nations. You will have many descendants and even kings will come from you. This agreement between us and your descendants will last forever. I will give your descendants the land of Canaan and be their God. Now, Abraham, you and your descendants must keep this agreement. Every male child among you must be circumcised, which means removing a small piece of skin from your body. This will be a sign of our agreement. Any male child who is not circumcised will not belong to our people. And as for your wife Sarai, I will bless her and give you a son through her. She will become the mother of nations. But Abraham fell on his face and laughed, thinking, ""How can a  hundred-year-old man and a ninety-year-old woman have a child?"" Then Abraham said to God, ""Please let Ishmael live before you!"" But God said, ""No, Sarah will have a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will establish my agreement with him and his descendants. I have also blessed Ishmael and he will have many descendants. But my agreement will be with Isaac, who will be born to Sarah at this time next year."" After talking to Abraham, God went away. Abraham then circumcised himself, his son Ishmael, and all the males in his household, whether they were born there or bought with money."
15,Genesis,16,"Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name [was] Hagar. And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai. And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife. And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes. And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong [be] upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee. But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid [is] in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face. And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai. And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands. And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude. And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou [art] with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction. And he will be a wild man; his hand [will be] against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren. And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me? Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, [it is] between Kadesh and Bered. And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael. And Abram [was] fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.","Sarai, who was Abram's wife, couldn't have children. But she had a servant named Hagar. Sarai said to Abram, ""God is not letting me have children. Please have a child with my servant so that we can have a family."" Abram listened to Sarai and did what she asked. After living in Canaan for ten years, Sarai gave Hagar to Abram as his wife. Abram and Hagar had a baby together.

When Hagar saw that she was pregnant, she started disrespecting Sarai. Sarai went to Abram and said, ""This is your fault! I gave my servant to you, and now she treats me badly because she is going to have your child. May God judge between us.""

Abram said to Sarai, ""Hagar is your servant. Do whatever you think is best."" Sarai mistreated Hagar so much that Hagar ran away. The angel of the Lord found Hagar near a water fountain in the desert. The angel asked Hagar, ""Where are you going?"" Hagar answered, ""I ran away from my mistress Sarai because she was being mean to me.""

The angel told Hagar, ""Go back to Sarai and obey her."" Then the angel said, ""I will make your descendants multiply and become countless."" The angel also told Hagar that she would have a son and should name him Ishmael, which means ""God hears."" The angel said that Ishmael would always be in conflict with others, and others would be in conflict with him. He would live amongst his relatives. Hagar called the Lord who spoke to her, ""You are a God who sees me."" She also named the well where she met the angel ""Beerlahairoi."" Hagar gave birth to Ishmael, and Abram named him Ishmael when he was eighty-six years old."
16,Genesis,17,"And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I [am] the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect. And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly. And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, As for me, behold, my covenant [is] with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee. And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God. And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations. This [is] my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised. And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you. And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which [is] not of thy seed. He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant. And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah [shall] her name [be]. And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be [a mother] of nations; kings of people shall be of her. Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall [a child] be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear? And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee! And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, [and] with his seed after him. And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation. But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year. And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham. And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him. And Abraham [was] ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. And Ishmael his son [was] thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son. And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.","Abram had a vision from the Lord, who told him not to be afraid because He would protect and reward him greatly. Abram was worried because he didn't have any children, and the person who would inherit his house was someone named Eliezer. But the Lord assured Abram that Eliezer would not be his heir, but rather a child from Abram's own family would be. The Lord then took Abram outside and asked him to look up at the sky and count the stars, telling him that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars. Abram believed the Lord, and because of his belief, the Lord considered Abram to be righteous. The Lord reminded Abram that He is the one who brought him out of his homeland and promised to give him the land they were standing on as an inheritance. Abram, wanting reassurance, asked the Lord how he could know for sure that he would receive this land. The Lord then instructed Abram to bring certain animals for a ceremony. Abram followed the instructions and prepared the animals, but when birds came to eat the animal carcasses, Abram chased them away. As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep and a terrifying darkness came over him. The Lord spoke to Abram in his sleep and let him know that his descendants would be strangers in a foreign land, serving and being mistreated by them for four hundred years. But the nation that would enslave Abram's descendants would be judged by the Lord, and then Abram's descendants would come out of that land with many possessions. The Lord assured Abram that he would die in peace and be buried at an old age. However, it would take four generations for his descendants to return to this land because the people living there, called the Amorites, had not yet committed enough wrongdoing. As the sun went down and it became dark, Abram saw a smoking furnace and a burning lamp pass between the animal pieces Abram had prepared. On that same day, the Lord made a covenant with Abram, promising that his descendants would receive the land from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates River. The Lord also listed the different groups of people who currently lived in that land."
17,Genesis,18,"And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw [them], he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground, And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree: And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said. And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead [it], and make cakes upon the hearth. And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave [it] unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it. And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set [it] before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat. And they said unto him, Where [is] Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard [it] in the tent door, which [was] behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah [were] old [and] well stricken in age; [and] it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh. And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do; Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him. And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know. And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD. And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that [are] therein? That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes. And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which [am but] dust and ashes: Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for [lack of] five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy [it]. And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do [it] for forty's sake. And he said [unto him], Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do [it], if I find thirty there. And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy [it] for twenty's sake. And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy [it] for ten's sake. And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.","Abraham was sitting outside his tent one hot day when he saw three men standing nearby. He ran to greet them and bowed down to show respect. He asked them to stay and rest under the tree while he fetched water to wash their feet and brought them food. Abraham hurried to his wife Sarah and asked her to quickly make bread and prepare a meal. He ran to choose a young calf from his herd and had it prepared for the guests. He served them the meal and stood by them as they ate. They asked where Sarah was, and Abraham said she was in the tent. One of the men said that Sarah would have a son, even though she and Abraham were very old. Sarah overheard this from inside the tent and laughed because she thought it was impossible. The Lord asked why Sarah laughed and said that nothing is too hard for Him, and that He will return at the appointed time and Sarah will have a son. Sarah denied laughing because she was afraid, but the Lord told her that He knew she did laugh. After the meal, the men looked towards Sodom, and Abraham went with them to see them off. The Lord wondered if He should hide His plans from Abraham, knowing that Abraham would become a great nation and his descendants would follow His ways. The Lord explained that He had heard the great sin and cry for justice from Sodom and Gomorrah, and He planned to go see if it was true, and if not, He would know. The other two men left to go to Sodom, but Abraham stayed with the Lord. Abraham approached the Lord and asked if He would destroy the righteous along with the wicked. He asked if there were fifty righteous people in the city, would God spare it. Abraham pleaded for mercy and asked if there were only forty-five, forty, thirty, twenty or even ten righteous people, would God still destroy the city. The Lord agreed that if He found even ten righteous people, He would spare the city. After their conversation, the Lord left and Abraham returned to his place."
18,Genesis,19,"And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing [them] rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground; And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night. And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat. But before they lay down, the men of the city, [even] the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter: And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where [are] the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them. And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him, And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly. Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as [is] good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof. And they said, Stand back. And they said [again], This one [fellow] came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, [even] Lot, and came near to break the door. But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door. And they smote the men that [were] at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door. And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring [them] out of this place: For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it. And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law. And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city. And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed. And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord: Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: Behold now, this city [is] near to flee unto, and it [is] a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, ([is] it not a little one?) and my soul shall live. And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken. Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar. The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar. Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven; And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD: And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace. And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt. And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters. And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father [is] old, and [there is] not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth: Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, [and] lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same [is] the father of the Moabites unto this day. And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same [is] the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.","Abraham and his wife Sarah traveled to a new place called Gerar. When they arrived, Abraham told the people there that Sarah was his sister. The king of Gerar, Abimelech, heard this and took Sarah to be his wife. But God appeared to Abimelech in a dream and told him that he would die because he had taken a married woman. Abimelech explained that he didn't know Sarah was already married and had done this with good intentions. God understood and told Abimelech to give Sarah back to Abraham. If he didn't, Abimelech and his people would die. Abimelech was scared and immediately returned Sarah to Abraham. Then he talked to Abraham and asked him why he had lied about Sarah being his sister. Abraham said he did it because he thought that the people in Gerar didn't have the fear of God and would harm him if they knew she was his wife. Abimelech felt sorry and gave Abraham gifts. He also told Abraham and Sarah that they could live anywhere they wanted in his land. Abimelech then spoke to Sarah and gave her silver and told her that Abraham was like a protector for her. God listened to Abraham's prayers and healed Abimelech and his family because they had unknowingly taken Sarah. Before this, no one in Abimelech's house could have children, but God opened their wombs and they were able to have children again."
19,Genesis,20,"And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar. And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She [is] my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou [art but] a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she [is] a man's wife. But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation? Said he not unto me, She [is] my sister? and she, even she herself said, He [is] my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this. And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. Now therefore restore the man [his] wife; for he [is] a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore [her] not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that [are] thine. Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid. Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God [is] not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake. And yet indeed [she is] my sister; she [is] the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This [is] thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He [is] my brother. And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave [them] unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. And Abimelech said, Behold, my land [is] before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee. And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand [pieces] of silver: behold, he [is] to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that [are] with thee, and with all [other]: thus she was reproved. So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare [children]. For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.","Two angels came to a city called Sodom in the evening. Lot, who lived there, saw them and went to meet them. He bowed down to them and invited them to stay at his house. But the angels said they would stay in the street. Lot urged them to come with him, so they went to his house.

Before they could rest, all the men from the city surrounded Lot's house. They called out to Lot and demanded that he bring out the two angels so they could harm them. Lot went out and tried to reason with them, begging them not to do such a wicked thing. He even offered his two daughters to them instead. But they insisted on hurting the angels.

The angels inside the house reached out and pulled Lot back inside. Then they struck the men outside with blindness so they couldn't find the door. The angels told Lot that God was going to destroy the city because of its wickedness. They instructed Lot to gather his family and leave the city.

But Lot's sons-in-law didn't believe him and thought he was joking. The next morning, the angels urgently told Lot to leave with his wife and two daughters before the destruction of the city. Lot hesitated, so the angels took hold of his hand, his wife's hand, and his daughters' hands and led them outside the city. They warned them not to look back and to escape to the mountains.

Lot pleaded with the angels to let him go to a small nearby city called Zoar instead. The angels agreed and told him to hurry to Zoar before they could do anything else. So Lot and his family went to Zoar and as soon as they arrived, God rained fire and burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah, completely destroying them and everything around.

However, against the angels' instruction, Lot's wife looked back at the destruction and instantly turned into a pillar of salt.

Abraham, who was Lot's uncle, got up early in the morning and saw the smoke rising from where Sodom and Gomorrah used to be. God remembered Abraham and saved Lot from the destruction. Lot was afraid to stay in Zoar, so he and his two daughters went to live in a cave in the mountains.

Later, Lot's older daughter said to her younger sister, ""There are no men around for us to marry. Let's make our father drink wine and lie with him so that we can have children."" That night, they made their father drink wine and the older daughter slept with him. The next morning, she told the younger daughter what she had done, and they made their father drink wine again. This time, the younger daughter slept with him. Both daughters became pregnant by their father.

The older daughter gave birth to a son named Moab, who became the father of the Moabite people. The younger daughter also had a son and named him Ben-ammi. He became the father of the Ammonite people."
20,Genesis,21,"And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken. For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him. And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him. And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, [so that] all that hear will laugh with me. And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born [him] a son in his old age. And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the [same] day that Isaac was weaned. And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking. Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, [even] with Isaac. And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son. And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he [is] thy seed. And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave [it] unto Hagar, putting [it] on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. And she went, and sat her down over against [him] a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against [him], and lift up her voice, and wept. And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he [is]. Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation. And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt. And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God [is] with thee in all that thou doest: Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: [but] according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned. And Abraham said, I will swear. And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away. And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I [of it], but to day. And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant. And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What [mean] these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves? And he said, For [these] seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well. Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them. Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. And [Abraham] planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God. And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.","Sarah, who was very old, had a baby boy just like God promised. They named him Isaac. When Isaac was eight days old, they followed God's command and circumcised him. Abraham was really happy and threw a big party to celebrate Isaac growing up. 

But Sarah saw that Ishmael, Abraham's other son, was making fun of Isaac. So she told Abraham to send Ishmael and his mom, Hagar, away. Abraham was sad about this, but God told him to listen to Sarah. God promised that Ishmael would become the father of a big nation too. 

Abraham gave Hagar and Ishmael some food and water and sent them away. They wandered in the wilderness, and when their water ran out, Hagar thought Ishmael would die. But God heard their cries and sent an angel to help them. The angel showed Hagar a well of water, and they both survived. Ishmael grew up in the wilderness and became a skilled archer. Hagar found him a wife from Egypt.

One day, a man named Abimelech and his chief captain came to Abraham. They could see that God was with Abraham, so they asked him to promise to always be fair and kind to them and their descendants. Abraham agreed and promised. Later, Abimelech and Abraham made a deal about a well of water that Abimelech's servants had taken. Abraham gave Abimelech some animals as a sign of their agreement.

Abraham called that place Beersheba, and he worshiped God there. After that, they lived peacefully in the land of the Philistines for a long time."
21,Genesis,22,"And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, [here] I [am]. And he said, Take now thy son, thine only [son] Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you. And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid [it] upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together. And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here [am] I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where [is] the lamb for a burnt offering? And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together. And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here [am] I. And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only [son] from me. And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind [him] a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son. And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said [to] this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen. And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only [son]: That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which [is] upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice. So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba. And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor; Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram, And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel. And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother. And his concubine, whose name [was] Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.","After some time, God tested Abraham. God called out to Abraham and said, ""Abraham!""

Abraham replied, ""Here I am.""

Then God said, ""Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah. There, offer him as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I will show you.""

Abraham woke up early in the morning and prepared for the journey. He took his donkey, two of his servants, and Isaac his son. He also brought wood for the offering. They traveled to the place God had told them about.

On the third day, Abraham saw the place in the distance. He told his servants to stay behind with the donkey while he and Isaac went to worship. Abraham took the wood for the offering and placed it on Isaac's shoulders. He carried a fire and a knife. Both of them walked together.

Isaac looked at his father and asked, ""Father, we have the fire and wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?""

Abraham replied, ""God will provide the lamb for the offering, my son."" So they continued walking together.

When they arrived at the place God had mentioned, Abraham built an altar and arranged the wood on it. Then he tied up Isaac and placed him on the altar, on top of the wood. Abraham reached out his hand to take the knife and sacrifice his son.

But just at that moment, the angel of the LORD called out to him from heaven, saying, ""Abraham, Abraham!""

Abraham responded, ""Here I am.""

The angel said, ""Do not harm the boy or do anything to him. Now I know that you truly fear God because you were willing to give up your son, your only son, for Me.""

Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught in a thicket by its horns. He went and took the ram and offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son. Abraham named that place Jehovahjireh, which means ""The LORD Will Provide."" It is still called that today. The angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven and said, ""Because you have obeyed my voice and did not withhold your son from Me, I swear by Myself that I will bless you greatly. I will multiply your descendants like the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will possess the cities of their enemies. And through your descendants, all the nations of the earth will be blessed, because you listened to Me.""

After this, Abraham and his servants returned to Beersheba and settled there.

Then Abraham received news that his brother Nahor's wife Milcah had given birth to several children: Huz, Buz, Kemuel (who became the father of Aram), Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel. Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. In addition to these children, Nahor had a concubine named Reumah, who bore him Tebah, Gaham, Thahash, and Maachah."
22,Genesis,23,"And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: [these were] the years of the life of Sarah. And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same [is] Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying, I [am] a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight. And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, Hear us, my lord: thou [art] a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead. And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, [even] to the children of Heth. And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which [is] in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you. And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, [even] of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that [is] therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead. And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land. And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou [wilt give it], I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take [it] of me, and I will bury my dead there. And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, My lord, hearken unto me: the land [is worth] four hundred shekels of silver; what [is] that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead. And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current [money] with the merchant. And the field of Ephron, which [was] in Machpelah, which [was] before Mamre, the field, and the cave which [was] therein, and all the trees that [were] in the field, that [were] in all the borders round about, were made sure Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city. And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same [is] Hebron in the land of Canaan. And the field, and the cave that [is] therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.","Sarah was a very old lady, she was 127 years old when she passed away. She died in a place called Hebron in the land of Canaan. Abraham was very sad and came to mourn for Sarah and cry for her.
Abraham spoke to the people who lived there and said, ""I am a stranger here, and I need a place to bury my wife. Can you give me a piece of land for this purpose?""
The people of that place said to Abraham, ""You are an important person among us. You can choose any burial place you want. We won't stop you from burying your wife in our land.""
Abraham thanked the people and bowed down before them. Then he said, ""Please talk to Ephron, the man who owns the cave of Machpelah. Ask him to sell it to me as a burial place for my wife. I will pay him the right amount of money.""
Ephron was there among the people of that place. He said to Abraham, ""No, you are our lord. I will give you the cave and the piece of land. You can bury your wife there in front of everyone.""
But Abraham wanted to make sure everything was done properly. So he said to Ephron, ""Please listen to me. I want to buy the land. I will pay you the fair price for it.""
Ephron answered, ""The land is worth 400 shekels of silver. What is that between friends? Go ahead and bury your wife.""
Abraham agreed to Ephron's offer. He weighed out 400 shekels of silver and gave it to Ephron in front of all the people. The field, the cave, and everything in it were now Abraham's property. He could bury his wife there.
Afterwards, Abraham buried Sarah in the cave. This cave was in the field of Machpelah near Mamre, the same place called Hebron in Canaan. The people of that place agreed that the field and the cave would belong to Abraham as a burial place for his wife."
23,Genesis,24,"And Abraham was old, [and] well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things. And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac. And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest? And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again. The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence. And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again. And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter. And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master [were] in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor. And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, [even] the time that women go out to draw [water]. And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham. Behold, I stand [here] by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water: And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: [let the same be] she [that] thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master. And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder. And the damsel [was] very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up. And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher. And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink. And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw [water] for thy camels also, until they have done drinking. And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw [water], and drew for all his camels. And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not. And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten [shekels] weight of gold; And said, Whose daughter [art] thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room [in] thy father's house for us to lodge in? And she said unto him, I [am] the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor. She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in. And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD. And he said, Blessed [be] the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I [being] in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren. And the damsel ran, and told [them of] her mother's house these things. And Rebekah had a brother, and his name [was] Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well. And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well. And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels. And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that [were] with him. And there was set [meat] before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on. And he said, I [am] Abraham's servant. And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses. And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath. And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell: But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son. And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me. And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house: Then shalt thou be clear from [this] my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee [one], thou shalt be clear from my oath. And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go: Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw [water], and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink; And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: [let] the same [be] the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's son. And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew [water]: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee. And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her [shoulder], and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also. And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter [art] thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands. And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son. And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left. Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good. Behold, Rebekah [is] before thee, take [her], and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken. And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, [bowing himself] to the earth. And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave [them] to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things. And they did eat and drink, he and the men that [were] with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master. And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us [a few] days, at the least ten; after that she shall go. And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master. And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth. And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go. And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men. And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou [art] our sister, be thou [the mother] of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them. And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way. And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country. And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels [were] coming. And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel. For she [had] said unto the servant, What man [is] this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant [had] said, It [is] my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself. And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done. And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's [death].","After Abraham's wife Sarah died, he married another woman named Keturah. They had many children together. Abraham gave all of his possessions to his son Isaac, but he also gave some gifts to his other children and sent them away. Abraham lived for a very long time, but eventually, he died and was buried next to Sarah. After Abraham died, God blessed his son Isaac. Isaac married a woman named Rebekah, but she couldn't have children. Isaac prayed to God, and God answered his prayer. Rebekah became pregnant with twins, and they struggled inside her womb. Rebekah was worried and asked God for help. God told her that her twins would become two nations, and that the older twin would serve the younger twin. When it was time for the twins to be born, the first one came out all red and hairy, and they named him Esau. Then his brother came out, holding onto Esau's heel, and they named him Jacob. As they grew up, Esau became a skilled hunter, while Jacob preferred to stay at home. Isaac loved Esau because he liked the food he brought him, but Rebekah loved Jacob. One day, Esau came home after hunting and was very hungry. He asked Jacob to give him some of the red stew he was cooking. Jacob saw an opportunity and made a deal with Esau. He asked Esau to sell him his birthright in exchange for the stew. Esau agreed and sold his birthright to Jacob. Afterward, Jacob gave Esau the stew, and Esau ate it and left."
24,Genesis,25,"Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name [was] Keturah. And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah. And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these [were] the children of Keturah. And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. And these [are] the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years. Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full [of years]; and was gathered to his people. And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which [is] before Mamre; The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi. Now these [are] the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham: And these [are] the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: These [are] the sons of Ishmael, and these [are] their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations. And these [are] the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people. And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that [is] before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: [and] he died in the presence of all his brethren. And these [are] the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac: And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian. And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she [was] barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If [it be] so, why [am] I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD. And the LORD said unto her, Two nations [are] in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and [the one] people shall be stronger than [the other] people; and the elder shall serve the younger. And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, [there were] twins in her womb. And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac [was] threescore years old when she bare them. And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob [was] a plain man, dwelling in tents. And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of [his] venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob. And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he [was] faint: And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red [pottage]; for I [am] faint: therefore was his name called Edom. And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. And Esau said, Behold, I [am] at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me? And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised [his] birthright.","Abraham was old, and God had taken care of him. Abraham asked his oldest servant to find a wife for his son, Isaac. He didn't want Isaac to marry someone from the Canaanite people, so he wanted the servant to go back to their homeland and find a wife from their own family. The servant was worried that the woman might not want to come with him, so he asked if he should bring Isaac back to their homeland instead. But Abraham said that it was important for Isaac to stay where they were. Abraham believed that God would send an angel with the servant to help him find a wife for Isaac. The servant agreed and promised to do what Abraham asked. He took ten camels and traveled to the city where Abraham's family lived. When he arrived, he stopped at a well outside the city and prayed for God's help. He asked God to guide him to the right woman, and he had a specific sign in mind: if the woman offered him water and also watered his camels, then he would know that she was the one God chose for Isaac. Before he finished praying, a woman named Rebekah came to the well. She was beautiful and kind. The servant asked her for a drink of water, and she gave him water from her pitcher. Then, without being asked, she watered all his camels. The servant watched with amazement. He knew that God had led him to Rebekah. He gave her some jewelry and asked about her family. She told him that she was from the same family as Abraham, and she had plenty of room in her home for him and his camels. The servant was overjoyed and thanked God for leading him to Rebekah. He went to her family's house and told them everything that had happened. Rebekah's brother and father agreed to let her go with the servant to marry Isaac. They all celebrated and had a meal together. The next morning, the servant wanted to leave and bring Rebekah to Isaac. But her family asked if she could stay with them for a little while longer. The servant insisted that he had to go, and they asked Rebekah if she wanted to leave with him. She said yes, and they all blessed her and wished her well. Rebekah and her maids traveled with the servant and his men back to Isaac. Meanwhile, Isaac was out in a field, and when he saw the camels coming, he knew something exciting was happening. Rebekah saw Isaac and got off her camel. She asked the servant who that man in the field was, and the servant told her it was Isaac. She covered her face with a veil and went to meet him. The servant told Isaac all that had happened, and Isaac brought Rebekah into his mother's tent and married her. Isaac loved Rebekah, and she brought him comfort after his mother passed away."
25,Genesis,26,"And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: And the men of the place asked [him] of his wife; and he said, She [is] my sister: for he feared to say, [She is] my wife; lest, [said he], the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she [was] fair to look upon. And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac [was] sporting with Rebekah his wife. And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she [is] thy wife: and how saidst thou, She [is] my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her. And Abimelech said, What [is] this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us. And Abimelech charged all [his] people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death. Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him. And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great: For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him. For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth. And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we. And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them. And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water. And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water [is] ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him. And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah. And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land. And he went up from thence to Beersheba. And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I [am] the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I [am] with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake. And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well. Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army. And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you? And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, [even] betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee; That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou [art] now the blessed of the LORD. And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water. And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city [is] Beersheba unto this day. And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite: Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.","There was a famine in the land where Isaac lived. He went to a king called Abimelech. God appeared to Isaac and told him not to go to Egypt, but to stay in the land that God would show him. God promised to bless Isaac and his children, and give them all the countries in that land. God said that Isaac's descendants would become as many as the stars in the sky and that all nations would be blessed through them. Isaac lived in Gerar. The people there asked Isaac about his wife, and Isaac said she was his sister because he was afraid they might kill him if they knew she was his wife. After some time, the king saw Isaac playing with his wife and realized that she was actually his wife. The king asked Isaac why he lied, and Isaac explained that he was afraid for his own safety. The king warned his people not to harm Isaac or his wife. Isaac planted crops and God blessed him with a hundred times more harvest than he expected. Isaac became very rich, owning many animals and servants. The people of Gerar became jealous of Isaac's wealth. They stopped up all the wells that had been dug by Isaac's father, Abraham. So, Isaac moved to the valley of Gerar and dug again the wells that were filled with Earth. Isaac's workers found a well with flowing water. But the people of Gerar argued with Isaac's workers, claiming it was their water. Isaac named that well ""Esek,"" meaning ""argument."" Then they dug another well, but they also argued over it. Isaac named it ""Sitnah,"" meaning ""opposition."" Isaac moved on and dug another well, and this time there was no argument. He called it ""Rehoboth,"" meaning ""wide open spaces,"" and said God had made room for them to be fruitful in the land. Isaac went to Beersheba, and God appeared to him at night, promising to bless him and multiply his descendants because of Abraham. Isaac built an altar and worshiped God there while his servants dug a well. The king and his friends came to Isaac and said they wanted to make a covenant with him because they saw God blessing him. They had a feast together and made an agreement, then they left in peace. On the same day, Isaac's servants told him about the well they had dug, and he named it ""Shebah"" which means ""oath."" Esau, Isaac's son, married two women from the Hittites, which made his parents upset."
26,Genesis,27,"And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, [here am] I. And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death: Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me [some] venison; And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring [it] to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die. And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt [for] venison, [and] to bring [it]. And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death. Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee. Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth: And thou shalt bring [it] to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death. And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother [is] a hairy man, and I [am] a smooth man: My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing. And his mother said unto him, Upon me [be] thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me [them]. And he went, and fetched, and brought [them] to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved. And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which [were] with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son: And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck: And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob. And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here [am] I; who [art] thou, my son? And Jacob said unto his father, I [am] Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me. And Isaac said unto his son, How [is it] that thou hast found [it] so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought [it] to me. And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou [be] my very son Esau or not. And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice [is] Jacob's voice, but the hands [are] the hands of Esau. And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him. And he said, [Art] thou my very son Esau? And he said, I [am]. And he said, Bring [it] near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought [it] near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank. And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son. And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son [is] as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed: Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed [be] every one that curseth thee, and blessed [be] he that blesseth thee. And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me. And Isaac his father said unto him, Who [art] thou? And he said, I [am] thy son, thy firstborn Esau. And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where [is] he that hath taken venison, and brought [it] me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, [and] he shall be blessed. And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, [even] me also, O my father. And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing. And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me? And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son? And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, [even] me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above; And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck. And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob. And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, [purposing] to kill thee. Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran; And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away; Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget [that] which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day? And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these [which are] of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?","Isaac called his son Jacob and blessed him. He told Jacob not to marry any girls from the Canaanite people. He wanted Jacob to go to his grandfather's house in Padanaram and find a wife from his uncle Laban's family. Isaac asked God Almighty to bless Jacob, make him very fruitful, and increase his descendants. He also asked God to give Jacob and his descendants the same blessings that were promised to Abraham. Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Padanaram to find a wife.

When Jacob left, Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to find a wife from Padanaram. Esau realized that his own marriages to the Canaanite women were not pleasing to their father, Isaac. So, he went to Ishmael, his uncle, and married Mahalath, Ishmael's daughter.

As Jacob traveled towards Haran, he found a certain place to spend the night. He took some stones and used them as a pillow to sleep on. While he was sleeping, Jacob had a dream. He saw a ladder that reached from the earth all the way to heaven. Angels were going up and down the ladder. The Lord stood at the top of the ladder and said that He was the God of Jacob's father, Abraham, and his father, Isaac. God promised to give Jacob the land he was sleeping on and to bless his descendants, who would become as numerous as the dust of the earth. God promised to be with Jacob wherever he went and to bring him back to this land. Jacob woke up and said, ""Surely the Lord is in this place, and I didn't know it."" He was afraid and said that it was the house of God and the gate of heaven.

Early in the morning, Jacob got up and took the stone he had used as a pillow. He set it up as a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. Jacob named the place Bethel. Before, it was called Luz. Then, Jacob made a vow to God. He promised that if God protected him on his journey and brought him back safely to his father's house, then the Lord would be his God. Jacob also said that the stone pillar he made would be God's house, and he promised to give a tenth of all that God gave him."
27,Genesis,28,"And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother. And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people; And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham. And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother. When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan; And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram; And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife. And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put [them for] his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep. And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I [am] the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. And, behold, I [am] with thee, and will keep thee in all [places] whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done [that] which I have spoken to thee of. And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew [it] not. And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful [is] this place! this [is] none other but the house of God, and this [is] the gate of heaven. And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put [for] his pillows, and set it up [for] a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city [was called] Luz at the first. And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God: And this stone, which I have set [for] a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.","Isaac, who was very old and couldn't see well, called his oldest son Esau. He told him to go hunting and bring back some tasty food that he could eat. Isaac wanted to bless Esau before he died. Isaac's wife, Rebekah, overheard this conversation and told their other son Jacob about it. She told Jacob to go and get two young goats so she could prepare a meal for Isaac. Jacob was worried that his father would realize he wasn't Esau and curse him instead of blessing him, but Rebekah assured him that she would take the blame if anything went wrong. Jacob brought the goats to his mother, and she cooked them and dressed Jacob in Esau's clothes. She also put goat skins on Jacob's hands and neck to make him feel hairy like Esau. Finally, she gave Jacob the food and sent him to Isaac. Jacob approached Isaac and pretended to be Esau. Isaac questioned him, but Jacob deceived him with his voice and hands. Isaac believed that Jacob was Esau and blessed him. He gave Jacob a blessing with lots of good things, authority over his brothers, and the promise that those who blessed him would also be blessed. Just as Jacob left Isaac's presence, Esau returned from hunting with his own food. He went to Isaac and asked him to bless him too. Isaac was shocked and realized that he had already blessed Jacob, who had tricked him. Esau cried out in bitterness and asked Isaac if he had any blessings left for him. Isaac told Esau about the blessings he had already given to Jacob and said that he couldn't take them back. Esau was angry at Jacob and planned to kill him after their father died. When Rebekah found out about Esau's plan, she warned Jacob to run away to her brother Laban in Haran. She told Jacob to stay with Laban until Esau's anger cooled down. Rebekah didn't want to lose both of her sons in one day. She also told Isaac that she was unhappy with the women Esau had married, and if Jacob married one of the local women, it would make her life even worse."
28,Genesis,29,"Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east. And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there [were] three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone [was] upon the well's mouth. And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place. And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence [be] ye? And they said, Of Haran [are] we. And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know [him]. And he said unto them, [Is] he well? And they said, [He is] well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep. And he said, Lo, [it is] yet high day, neither [is it] time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go [and] feed [them]. And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and [till] they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep. And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she kept them. And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. And Jacob told Rachel that he [was] her father's brother, and that he [was] Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father. And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things. And Laban said to him, Surely thou [art] my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month. And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou [art] my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what [shall] thy wages [be]? And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder [was] Leah, and the name of the younger [was] Rachel. Leah [was] tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured. And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. And Laban said, [It is] better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me. And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him [but] a few days, for the love he had to her. And Jacob said unto Laban, Give [me] my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her. And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her. And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid [for] an handmaid. And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it [was] Leah: and he said to Laban, What [is] this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me? And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn. Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years. And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also. And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid. And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years. And when the LORD saw that Leah [was] hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel [was] barren. And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me. And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I [was] hated, he hath therefore given me this [son] also: and she called his name Simeon. And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi. And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.","Rachel was sad because she couldn't have any children. She asked her husband Jacob to give her children or else she would die. Jacob was mad at Rachel and told her that he couldn't give her children because only God could. Then Rachel told Jacob to have children with her servant Bilhah, so that she could have children through her. Jacob listened to Rachel and had children with Bilhah, and she gave birth to a son named Dan and later another son named Naphtali. 

Then Leah saw that she couldn't have any more children, so she gave her servant Zilpah to Jacob as a wife. Zilpah gave birth to a son. Leah named him Gad. Zilpah had another son, and Leah named him Asher. 

One day, Reuben, Jacob's oldest son, found some special plants called mandrakes in the field and gave them to his mother Leah. Rachel wanted the mandrakes, so she asked Leah to give them to her. But Leah got mad at Rachel and said no because Rachel had already taken her husband Jacob. Rachel told Leah that she could have Jacob for one night in exchange for the mandrakes. Jacob agreed and slept with Leah. As a result, Leah became pregnant and gave birth to another son named Issachar. A while later, Leah had another son named Zebulun and then a daughter named Dinah. 

God thought about Rachel and opened her womb. Rachel became pregnant and gave birth to a son named Joseph. She was very happy and said God had taken away her sadness. Rachel named her son Joseph and said that God would give her another son in the future. 

After Joseph was born, Jacob wanted to go back to his own country. He asked his father-in-law Laban to give him his wives and children so that they could leave. Laban wanted Jacob to stay because he believed that Jacob's presence had brought him blessings. Laban asked Jacob what he wanted in return for his service. Jacob told Laban that he didn't need anything. Instead, he asked for all the speckled and spotted cattle from Laban's flock as his payment. Jacob had a plan to increase his own flock. Laban agreed, so Jacob separated the speckled and spotted livestock from the rest of the flock and put them in front of the stronger cattle when they mated. As a result, Jacob's flock grew bigger and stronger, and he became very rich with many animals and servants."
29,Genesis,30,"And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die. And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, [Am] I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb? And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her. And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her. And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son. And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan. And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son. And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali. When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife. And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son. And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad. And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son. And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher. And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes. And she said unto her, [Is it] a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes. And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night. And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son. And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar. And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son. And Leah said, God hath endued me [with] a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun. And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah. And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb. And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach: And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son. And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country. Give [me] my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee. And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, [tarry: for] I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake. And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give [it]. And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me. For [it was] little which thou hadst before I [came], and it is [now] increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also? And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed [and] keep thy flock: I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and [of such] shall be my hire. So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that [is] not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me. And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word. And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, [and] every one that had [some] white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave [them] into the hand of his sons. And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks. And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which [was] in the rods. And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink. And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted. And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle. And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods. But when the cattle were feeble, he put [them] not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's. And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.","Jacob traveled to a faraway land and saw a well in a field. There were three groups of sheep lying next to the well, waiting to drink water. There was a big stone covering the well. The shepherds would remove the stone and water the sheep, and then put the stone back in its place. Jacob asked the shepherds where they were from, and they said they were from Haran. Jacob asked if they knew Laban, and they said they did. Jacob then asked if Laban was doing well, and they said he was and that Laban's daughter Rachel was coming with the sheep. It was still early in the day, and the shepherds explained that they couldn't water the sheep until all the flocks were gathered together and the stone was removed from the well. While they were talking, Rachel arrived with her father's sheep. Jacob went over and removed the stone from the well, and then watered Laban's flock. Jacob was so happy to see Rachel that he kissed her and cried. He told Rachel that he was her relative, and she ran to tell her father. Laban heard the news and went to meet Jacob. He hugged and kissed Jacob and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban everything that had happened. Laban said to Jacob, ""You are my relative, so you shouldn't work for me for nothing. Tell me, what do you want as your wages?"" Laban had two daughters, Leah and Rachel. Leah had tender eyes, but Rachel was beautiful. Jacob loved Rachel and offered to work for Laban for seven years in exchange for marrying Rachel. Laban agreed, saying it was better for Jacob to marry Rachel than someone else. So Jacob worked for Laban for seven years, but it seemed like a short time because he loved Rachel so much. When the seven years were over, Jacob asked Laban to give him Rachel as his wife. Laban gathered all the people of the place and they had a big feast. That night, however, Laban tricked Jacob and gave him Leah instead of Rachel. Laban also gave Leah his servant Zilpah as her maid. When Jacob realized what had happened, he confronted Laban and asked why he had deceived him. Laban explained that in their country, it was not allowed to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older daughter. He told Jacob to fulfill the marriage week with Leah, and then he could also marry Rachel if he worked for him for seven more years. Jacob agreed to this arrangement and completed the marriage week with Leah. Laban then gave Rachel to Jacob as his wife as well. Rachel had a servant named Bilhah, who became her maid. Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah and continued to work for Laban for another seven years. But Rachel could not have children, while Leah could. Leah had a son and named him Reuben, saying that God had seen her suffering and that her husband would love her now. Leah had another son and named him Simeon, saying that God had heard that she was hated and had given her another son. She had a third son, whom she named Levi, believing that now her husband would be joined to her since she had given him three sons. Leah had another son and named him Judah, saying that she would praise the Lord. After that, she stopped having children."
