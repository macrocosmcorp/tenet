Sura I.


Fatiha, or the Opening Chapter.

1. In the name of God, Most Gracious,
 Most Merciful.

2. Praise be to God,
 The Cherisher and Sustainer of the Worlds;

3. Most Gracious, Most Merciful;

4. Master of the Day of Judgment.

5. Thee do we worship,
 And Thine aid we seek.

6. Show us the straight way,

7. The way of those on whom
 Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace,
 Those whose (portion)
 Is not wrath,
 And who go not astray.



  

Sura II.

  

Baqara, or the Heifer.



1. A. L. M.

2. This is the Book;
 In it is guidance sure, without doubt,
 To those who fear God;

3. Who believe in the Unseen,
 Are steadfast in prayer,
 And spend out of what We
 Have provided for them;

4. And who believe in the Revelation
 Sent to thee,

And sent before thy time,
 And (in their hearts)
 Have the assurance of the Hereafter.

5. They are on (true) guidance,
 From their Lord, and it is
 These who will prosper.

6. As to those who reject Faith,
 It is the same to them
 Whether thou warn them
 Or do not warn them;
 They will not believe.

7. God hath set a seal
 On their hearts and on their hearing,
 And on their eyes is a veil;
 Great is the penalty they (incur).

  

SECTION 2.

8. Of the people there are some who say:
 "We believe in God and the Last Day;"
 But they do not (really) believe.

9. Fain would they deceive
 God and those who believe,
 But they only deceive themselves,
 And realize (it) not!

10. In their hearts is a disease;

And God has increased their disease:
 And grievous is the penalty they (incur),
 Because they are false (to themselves).

11. When it is said to them:
 "Make not mischief on the earth,"
 They say: "Why, we only
 Want to make peace!"

12. Of a surety, they are the ones
 Who make mischief,
 But they realize (it) not.

13. When it is said to them:
 "Believe as the others believe:"
 They say: "Shall we believe
 As the fools believe?"
 Nay, of a surety they are the fools,
 But they do not know."

14. When they meet those who believe,
 They say: "We believe;"
 But when they are alone
 With their evil ones,
 They say: "We are really with you:
 We (were) only jesting."

15. God will throw back
 Their mockery on them,
 And give them rope in their trespasses;
 So they will wander like blind ones
 (To and fro).

16. These are they who have bartered
 Guidance for error:

But their traffic is profitless,
 And they have lost true direction,

17. Their similitude is that of a man
 Who kindled a fire;
 When it lighted all around him,
 God took away their light
 And left them in utter darkness.
 So they could not see.

18. Deaf, dumb, and blind,
 They will not return (to the path).

19. Or (another similitude)
 Is that of a rain-laden cloud
 From the sky: in it are zones
 Of darkness, and thunder and lightning:
 They press their fingers in their ears
 To keep out the stunning thunder-clap,
 The while they are in terror of death.
 But God is ever round
 The rejecters of Faith!

20. The lightning all but snatches away
 Their sight; every time the light
 (Helps) them, they walk therein,
 And when the darkness grows on them,
 They stand still.
 And if God willed, He could take away
 Their faculty of hearing and seeing;
 For God hath power over all things

  

SECTION 3.

21. O ye people!
 Adore your Guardian-Lord,
 Who created you
 And those who came before you,
 That ye may have the chance
 To learn righteousness;

22. Who has made the earth your couch,
 And the heavens your canopy;
 And sent down rain from the heavens;
 And brought forth therewith
 Fruits for your sustenance;
 Then set not up rivals unto God
 When ye know (the truth).

23. And if ye are in doubt
 As to what We have revealed
 From time to time to Our servant,
 Then produce a Sura
 Like thereunto;
 And call your witnesses or helpers
 (If there are any) besides God,
 If your (doubts) are true.

24. But if ye cannot
 And of a surety ye cannot--
 Then fear the Fire
 Whose fuel is Men and Stones,--
 Which is prepared for those

Who reject Faith.

25. But give glad tidings
 To those who believe
 And work righteousness,
 That their portion is Gardens,
 Beneath which rivers flow.
 Every time they are fed
 With fruits therefrom,
 They say: "Why, this is
 What we were fed with before,"
 For they are given things in similitude;
 And they have therein
 Companions pure (and holy);
 And they abide therein (for ever).

26. God disdains not to use
 The similitude of things,
 Lowest as well as highest.

Those who believe know
 That it is truth from their Lord;
 But those who reject Faith say:
 "What means God by this similitude?"
 By it He causes many to stray,
 And many He leads into the right path;
 But He causes not to stray,
 Except those who forsake (the path),--

27. Those who break God's Covenant
 After it is ratified,
 And who sunder what God
 Has ordered to be joined,
 And do mischief on earth:
 These cause loss (only) to themselves.

28. How can ye reject
 The faith in God?--
 Seeing that ye were without life,
 And He gave you life
 Then will He cause you to die,
 And will again bring you to life;
 And again to Him will ye return.

29. It is He Who hath created for you
 All things that are on earth;
 Moreover His design comprehended the heavens,
 For He gave order and perfection
 To the seven firmaments;
 And of all things
 He hath perfect knowledge.

  

SECTION 4.

30. Behold, thy Lord said to the angels: "I will create
 A vicegerent on earth." They said:
 "Wilt Thou place therein one who will make
 Mischief therein and shed blood?--
 Whilst we do celebrate Thy praises
 And glorify Thy holy (name)?"
 He said: "I know what ye know not."

31. And He taught Adam the nature
 Of all things; then He placed them
 Before the angels, and said: "Tell Me
 The nature of these if ye are right."

32. They said: "Glory to Thee: of knowledge

We have none, save what Thou
 Hast taught us: in truth it is Thou
 Who art perfect in knowledge and wisdom."

33. He said: "O Adam! tell them
 Their natures." When he had told them,
 God said: "Did I not tell you
 That I know the secrets of heaven
 And earth, and I know what ye reveal
 And what ye conceal?"

34. And behold, We said to the angels:
 "Bow down to Adam: "and they bowed down:
 Not so Iblis: he refused and was haughty:
 He was of those who reject Faith.

35. We said: "O Adam! dwell thou
 And thy wife in the Garden;
 And eat of the bountiful things therein
 As (where and when) ye will; but approach not this tree,
 Or ye run into harm and transgression."

36. Then did Satan make them slip
 From the (Garden), and get them out

Of the state (of felicity) in which
 They had been. We said:
 "Get ye down, all (ye people),
 With enmity between yourselves.
 On earth will be your dwelling-place
 And your means of livelihood--
 For a time."

37. Then learnt Adam from his Lord
 Words of inspiration, and his Lord
 Turned towards him; for He
 Is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.

38. We said: "Get ye down all from here;
 And if, as is sure, there comes to you
 Guidance from Me, whosoever
 Follows My guidance, on them
 Shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.

39. "But those who reject Faith
 And belie Our Signs,
 They shall be Companions of the Fire;
 They shall abide therein."

  

SECTION 5.

40. O Children of Israel! call to mind
 The (special) favour which I bestowed
 Upon you, and fulfil your Covenants
 With Me as I fulfil My Covenant
 With you, and fear none but Me.

41. And believe in what I reveal,
 Confirming the revelation
 Which is with you,
 And be not the first to reject
 Faith therein, nor sell My Signs
 For a small price; and fear Me,
 And Me alone.

42. And cover not Truth
 With falsehood, nor conceal
 The Truth when ye know (what it is).

43. And be steadfast in prayer;
 Practise regular charity;
 And bow down your heads
 With those who bow down (in worship).

44. Do ye enjoin right conduct
 On the people, and forget
 (To practise it) yourselves,
 And yet ye study the Scripture?
 Will ye not understand?

45. Nay, seek (God's) help
 With patient perseverance
 And prayer:
 It is indeed hard, except
 To those who bring a lowly spirit,--

46. Who bear in mind the certainty
 That they are to meet their Lord,
 And that they are to return to Him.

  

SECTION 6.

47. O Children of Israel! call to mind
 The (special) favour which I bestowed
 Upon you, and that I preferred you
 To all others (for My Message).

48. Then guard yourselves against a day
 When one soul shall not avail another
 Nor shall intercession be accepted for her,
 Nor shall compensation be taken from her,
 Nor shall anyone be helped (from outside).

49. And remember, We delivered you
 From the people of Pharaoh: they set you
 Hard tasks and punishments, slaughtered

Your sons and let your women-folk live;
 Therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord.

50. And remember We divided
 The Sea for you and saved you
 And drowned Pharaoh's people
 Within your very sight.

51. And remember We appointed
 Forty nights for Moses,
 And in his absence ye took
 The calf (for worship),
 And ye did grievous wrong.

52. Even then We did forgive you;
 There was a chance for you
 To be grateful.

53. And remember We gave
 Moses the Scripture and the Criterion

(Between right and wrong): there was
 A chance for you to be guided aright.

54. And remember Moses said
 To his people: "O my people!
 Ye have indeed wronged
 Yourselves by your worship of the calf:
 So turn (in repentance) to your Maker,
 And slay yourselves (the wrong-doers);
 That will be better for you
 In the sight of your Maker."
 Then He turned towards you (in forgiveness):
 For He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.

55. And remember ye said: "O Moses!
 We shall never believe in thee
 Until we see God manifestly,"
 But ye were dazed
 With thunder and lightning
 Even as ye looked on.

56. Then We raised you up
 After your death:
 Ye had the chance
 To be grateful.

57. And We gave you the shade of clouds

And sent down to you
 Manna and quails, saying:
 "Eat of the good things
 We have provided fcr you:"
 (But they rebelled);
 To Us they did no harm,
 But they harmed their own souls.

58. And remember We said:
 "Enter this town, and eat
 Of the plenty therein
 As ye wish; but enter
 The gate with humility,
 In posture and in words,
 And We shall forgive you your faults
 And increase (the portion of)
 Those who do good."

59. But the transgressors
 Changed the word from that
 Which had been given them;
 So We sent on the transgt essors
 A plague from heaven,
 For that they infringed
 (Our command) repeatedly.

  

SECTION 7.

60. And remember Moses prayed
 For water for his people;
 We said: "Strike the rock
 With thy staff." Then gushed forth

Therefrom twelve springs.
 Each group knew its own place
 For water. So eat and drink
 Of the sustenance provided by God,
 And do no evil nor mischief
 On the (face of the) earth.

61. And remember ye said:
 "O Moses! we cannot endure
 One kind of food (always);
 So beseech thy Lord for us
 To produce for us of what the earth
 Groweth,--its pot-herbs, and cucumbers,
 Its garlic, lentils, and onions."
 He said: "Will ye exchange
 The better for the worse?
 Go ye down to any town,"
 And ye shall find what ye want!"

They were covered with humiliation
 And misery; they drew
 On themselves the wrath of God.
 This because they went on
 Rejecting the Signs of God
 And slaying His Messengers
 Without just cause.
 This because they rebelled
 And went on transgressing.

  

SECTION 8.

62. Those who believe (in the Qur-an),
 And those who follow the Jewish (scriptures),
 And the Christians and the Sabians,--
 Any who believe in God
 And the Last Day,
 And work righteousness,
 Shall have their reward

With their Lord: on them
 Shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.

63. And remember We took
 Your Covenant
 And We raised above you
 (The towering height)
 Of Mount (Sinai):
 (Saying): "Hold firmly
 To what We have given you
 And bring (ever) to remembrance
 What is therein:
 Perchance ye may fear God."

64. But ye turned back thereafter:
 Had it not been for the Grace
 And Mercy of God to you,
 Ye had surely been
 Among the lost.

65. And well ye knew
 Those amongst you
 Who transgressed
 In the matter of the Sabbath:
 We said to them:
 "Be ye apes,
 Despised and rejected."

66. So We made it an example
 To their own time

And to their posterity,
 And a lesson
 To those who fear God.

67. And remember Moses said
 To his people: "God commands
 That ye sacrifice a heifer."
 They said: "Makest thou
 A laughing-stock of us?"
 He said: "God save me
 From being an ignorant (fool)!"

68. They said: "Beseech on our behalf
 Thy Lord to make plain to us
 What (heifer) it is!"
 He said: "He says: the heifer
 Should be neither too old
 Nor too young, but of middling
 Age: now do what ye are commanded!"

69. They said: "Beseech on our behalf
 Thy Lord to make plain to us
 Her colour." He said: "He says:
 A fawn-coloured heifer,
 Pure and rich in tone,
 The admiration of beholders!"

70. They said: "Beseech on our behalf
 Thy Lord to make plain to us
 What she is: to us are all heifers
 Alike: we wish indeed for guidance,
 If God wills."

71. He said: "He says: a heifer
 Not trained to till the soil
 Or water the fields: sound
 And without blemish." They said:
 "Now hast thou brought
 The truth." Then they offered
 Her in sacrifice,
 But not with good-will.

  

SECTION 9.

72. Remember ye slew a man
 And fell into a dispute
 Among yourselves as to the crime:
 But God was to bring forth
 What ye did hide.

73. So We said: "Strike the (body)
 With a piece of the (heifer)."
 Thus God bringeth the dead
 To life and showeth you His Signs:
 Perchance ye may understand.

74. Thenceforth were your hearts
 Hardened: they became
 Like a rock and even worse
 In hardness. For among rocks
 There are some from which
 Rivers gush forth; others
 There are which when split
 Asunder send forth water;
 And others which sink

For fear of God. And God is
 Not unmindful of what ye do.

75. Can ye (O ye men of Faith)
 Entertain the hope that they
 Will believe in you?--
 Seeing that a party of them
 Heard the Word of God,
 And perverted it knowingly
 After they understood it.

76. Behold! when they meet
 The men of Faith, they say:
 "We believe": but when
 They meet each other in private,
 They say: "Shall you tell them
 What God hath revealed to you,
 That they may engage you
 In argument about it
 Before your Lord?"--
 Do ye not understand (their aim)?

77. Know they not that God
 Knoweth what they conceal
 And what they reveal?

78. And there are among them
 Illiterates, who know not the Book,
 But (see therein their own) desires,
 And they do nothing but conjecture.

79. Then woe to those who write
 The Book with their own hands,
 And then say: "This is from God,"
 To traffic with it
 For a miserable price!--
 Woe to them for what their hands
 Do write, and for the gain
 They make thereby.

80. And they say: "The Fire
 Shall not touch us
 But for a few numbered days:"
 Say: "Have ye taken a promise
 From God, for He never
 Breaks His promise?
 Or is it that ye say of God
 What ye do not know?"

81. Nay, those who seek gain
 In Evil, and are girt round
 By their sins,
 They are Companions of the Fire:
 Therein shall they abide
 (For ever).

82. But those who have faith
 And work righteousness,

They are Companions of the Garden:
 Therein shall they abide
 (For ever).

  

SECTION 10.

83. And remember We took
 A Covenant from the Children
 Of Israel (to this effect):
 Worship none but God;
 Treat with kindness
 Your parents and kindred,
 And orphans and those in need;
 Speak fair to the people;
 Be steadfast in prayer;
 And practise regular charity.
 Then did ye turn back,
 Except a few among you,
 And ye backslide (even now).

84. And remember We took
 Your Covenant (to this effect):
 Shed no blood amongst you,
 Nor turn out your own people
 From your homes: and this
 Ye solemnly ratified,
 And to this ye can bear witness.

85. After this it is ye, the same people,
 Who slay among yourselves,
 And banish a party of you
 From their homes; assist
 (Their enemies) against them,
 In guilt and rancour;
 And if they come to you
 As captives, ye ransom them,

Though it was not lawful
 For you to banish them.
 Then is it only a part of the Book
 That ye believe in,
 And do ye reject the rest?
 But what is the reward for those
 Among you who behave like this
 But disgrace in this life?--
 And on the Day of Judgment
 They shall be consigned
 To the most grievous penalty.
 For God is not unmindful
 Of what ye do.

86. These are the people who buy
 The life of this world at the price
 Of the Hereafter: their penalty
 Shall not be lightened
 Nor shall they be helped.

  

SECTION 11.

87. We gave Moses the Book
 And followed him up
 With a succession of Apostles;
 We gave Jesus the son of Mary
 Clear (Signs) and strengthened him
 With the holy spirit. Is it
 That whenever there comes to you
 An Apostle with what ye
 Yourselves desire not, ye are
 Puffed up with pride?--
 Some ye called impostors,
 And others ye slay!

88. They say, "Our hearts
 Are the wrappings (which preserve
 God's Word: we need no more)."
 Nay, God's curse is on them
 For their blasphemy:
 Little is it they believe.

89. And when there comes to them
 A Book from God, confirming
 What is with them,--although
 From of old they had prayed
 For victory against those
 Without Faith,--when there comes.
 To them that which they
 (Should) have recognized,
 They refuse to believe in it
 But the curse of God
 Is on those without Faith.

90. Miserable is the price
 For which they have sold
 Their souls, in that they
 Deny (the revelation)
 Which God has sent down,
 In insolent envy that God
 Of His Grace should send it
 To any of His servants He pleases:

Thus have they drawn
 On themselves Wrath upon Wrath.
 And humiliating is the punishment
 Of those who reject Faith.

91. When it is said to them,
 "Believe in what God
 Hath sent down," they say,
 "We believe in what was sent down
 To us": yet they reject
 All besides, even if it be Truth
 Confirming what is with them.
 Say: "Why then have ye slain
 The prophets of God in times
 Gone by, if ye did indeed
 Believe?"

92. There came to you Moses
 With clear (Signs); yet
 Ye worshipped the Calf
 (Even) after that, and ye
 Did behave wrongfully.

93. And remember We took
 Your Covenant and We raised
 Above you (the towering height)
 Of Mount (Sinai):
 (Saying): "Hold firmly
 To what We have given you,
 And hearken (to the Law)"
 They said: "We hear,
 And we disobey"
 And they had to drink

Into their hearts
 (Of the taint) of the Calf
 Because of their Faithlessness.
 Say: "Vile indeed
 Are the behests of your Faith
 If ye have any faith!"

94. Say: "If the last Home,
 With God, be for you specially,
 And not for anyone else,
 Then seek ye for death,
 If ye are sincere."

95. But they will never seek
 For death, on account of the (sins)
 Which their hands have sent
 On before them.
 And God is well-acquainted
 With the wrong-doers.

96. Thou wilt indeed find them,
 Of all people, most greedy
 Of life,--even more
 Than the idolaters:
 Each one of them wishes
 He could be given a life
 Of a thousand years:
 But the grant of such life
 Will not save him
 From (due) punishment.
 For God sees well
 All that they do.

  

SECTION 12.

97. Say: Whoever is an enemy
 To Gabriel--for he brings down

The (revelation) to thy heart
 By God's will, a confirmation
 Of what went before,
 And guidance and glad tidings
 For those who believe,--

98. Whoever is an enemy to God
 And His angels and apostles,
 To Gabriel and Michael,--
 Lo! God is an enemy to those
 Who reject Faith.

99. We have sent down to thee
 Manifest Signs (ayat);
 And none reject them
 But those who are perverse.

100. Is it not (the case) that
 Every time they make a Covenant,
 Some party among them
 Throw it aside?--Nay,
 Most of them are faithless.

101. And when there came to them
 An Apostle from God,
 Confirming what was with them,
 A party of the People of the Book
 Threw away the Book of God
 Behind their backs,
 As if (it had been something)
 They did not know!

102. They followed what the evil ones
 Gave out (falsely)
 Against the power
 Of Solomon: the blasphemers
 Were, not Solomon, but
 The evil ones, teaching men

Magic, and such things
 As came down at Babylon
 To the angels Harut and Marut.
 But neither of these taught anyone
 (Such things) without saying:
 "We are only for trial;
 So do not blaspheme."
 They learned from them
 The means to sow discord
 Between man and wife.
 But they could not thus
 Harm anyone except
 By God's permission.
 And they learned what harmed them,
 Not what profited them.
 And they knew that the buyers
 Of (magic) would have
 No share in the happiness
 Of the Hereafter. And vile
 Was the price for which
 They did sell their souls,
 If they but knew!

103. If they had kept their Faith
 And guarded themselves from evil,

Far better had been
 The reward from their Lord,
 If they but knew!

  

SECTION 13

104. ye of Faith!
 Say not (to the Apostle)
 Words of ambiguous import,
 But words of respect;
 And hearken (to him):
 To those without Faith
 Is a grievous punishment.

105. It is never the wish
 Of those without Faith
 Among the People of the Book,
 Nor of the Pagans,
 That anything good
 Should come down to you
 From your Lord.
 But God will choose
 For His special Mercy
 Whom He will--for God is
 Lord of grace abounding.

106. None of Our revelations
 Do We abrogate
 Or cause to be forgotten,
 But We substitute

Something better or similar:
 Knowest thou not that God
 Hath power over all things?

107. Knowest thou not
 That to God belongeth
 The dominion of the heavens
 And the earth?
 And besides Him ye have
 Neither patron nor helper.

108. Would ye question
 Your Apostle as Moses's
 Was questioned of old?
 But whoever changeth
 From Faith to Unbelief,
 Hath strayed without doubt
 From the even way.

109. Quite a number of the People
 Of the Book wish they could
 Turn you (people) back
 To infidelity after ye have believed,
 From selfish envy,
 After the Truth hath become
 Manifest unto them:
 But forgive and overlook,

Till God accomplish
 His purpose; for God
 Hath power over all things.'

110. And be steadfast in prayer
 And regular in charity:
 And whatever good
 Ye send forth for your souls
 Before you, ye shall find it
 With God: for God sees
 Well all that ye do.

111. And they say: "None
 Shall enter Paradise unless
 He be a Jew or a Christian."
 Those are their (vain) desires.
 Say: "Produce your proof
 If ye are truthful."

112. Nay,--whoever submits
 His whole self to God
 And is a doer of good,
 He will get his reward
 With his Lord;
 On such shall be no fear,
 Nor shall they grieve.

  

SECTION 14.

113. The Jews say: "The Christians
 Have naught (to stand) upon;
 And the Christians say:
 "The Jews have naught
 (To stand) upon." Yet they
 (Profess to) study the (same) Book.
 Like unto their word
 Is what those say who know not;

But God will judge
 Between them in their quarrel
 On the Day of Judgment.

114. And who is more unjust
 Than he who forbids
 That in places for the worship
 Of God, God's name should be
 Celebrated?--whose zeal
 Is (in fact) to ruin them?
 It was not fitting that such
 Should themselves enter them
 Except in fear. For them
 There is nothing but disgrace
 In this world, and in the world
 To come, an exceeding torment.

115. To God belong the East
 And the West: whithersoever
 Ye turn, there is the Presence
 Of God. For God is All-Pervading,
 All-Knowing.

116. They say: "God hath begotten
 A son": Glory be to Him.--Nay,
 To Him belongs all
 That is in the heavens
 And on earth: everything
 Renders worship to Him.'"

117. To Him is due
 The primal origin

Of the heavens and the earth:
 When He decreeth a matter,
 He saith to it: "Be,"
 And it is.

118. Say those without knowledge:
 "Why speaketh not God
 Unto us? Or why cometh not
 Unto us a Sign?"
 So said the people before them
 Words of similar import.
 Their hearts are alike.
 We have indeed made clear
 The Signs unto any people
 Who hold firmly
 To Faith (in their hearts).

119. Verily We have sent thee
 In truth as a bearer
 Of glad tidings and a warner:
 But of thee no question
 Shall be asked of the Companions
 Of the Blazing Fire.

120. Never will the Jews
 Or the Christians be satisfied
 With thee unless thou follow
 Their form of religion. Say:

"The Guidance of God,--that
 Is the (only) Guidance."
 Wert thou to follow their desires
 After the knowledge
 Which hath reached thee,
 Then wouldst thou find
 Neither Protector nor Helper
 Against God.

121. Those to whom We have sent
 The Book study it as it
 Should be studied: they are
 The ones that believe therein:
 Those who reject faith therein,--
 The loss is their own.

  

SECTION 15.

122. O Children of Israel! call to mind
 The special favour which I bestowed
 Upon you, and that I preferred you
 To all others (for My Message).

123. Then guard yourselves against a Day

When one soul shall not avail another,
 Nor shall compensation be
 accepted from her
 Nor shall intercession profit her
 Nor shall anyone be helped (from outside).

124. And remember that Abraham
 Was tried by his Lord
 With certain Commands,
 Which he fulfilled:
 He said: "I will make thee
 An Imam to the Nations."
 He pleaded: "And also
 (Imams) from my offspring!"
 He answered: "But My Promise
 Is not within the reach
 Of evil-doers."

125. Remember We made the House
 A place of assembly for men
 And a place of safety;
 And take ye the Station
 Of Abraham as a place
 Of prayer; and We covenanted
 With Abraham and lsma'il,
 That they should sanctify
 My House for those who
 Compass it round, or use it

As a retreat, or bow, or
 Prostrate themselves (therein
 In prayer).

126. And remember Abraham said:
 "My Lord, make this a City
 Of Peace, and feed its People
 With fruits,--such of them
 As believe in God and the Last Day."
 He said: "(Yea), and such as
 Reject Faith,--for a while
 Will I grant them their pleasure,
 But will soon drive them
 To the torment of Fire,--
 An evil destination (indeed)!"

127. And remember Abraham
 And Isma'il raised
 The foundations of the House
 (With this prayer): "Our Lord!
 Accept (this service) from us:
 For Thou art the All-Hearing,
 The All-Knowing.

128. "Our Lord! make of us
 Muslims, bowing to Thy (Will),
 And of our progeny a people
 Muslim, bowing to Thy (Will);
 And show us our places for
 The celebration of (due) rites;
 And turn unto us (in Mercy);
 For Thou art the Oft-Returning,
 Most Merciful.

129. "Our Lord! send amongst them
 An Apostle of their own,
 Who shall rehearse Thy Signs
 To them and instruct them

In Scripture and Wisdom,
 And sanctify them:
 For Thou art the Exalted in Might,
 The Wise."

  

SECTION 16.

130. And who turns away
 From the religion of Abraham
 But such as debase their souls
 With folly? Him We chose
 And rendered pure in this world:
 And he will be in the Hereafter
 In the ranks of the Righteous.

131. Behold! his Lord said
 To him: "Bow (thy will to Me):"
 He said: "I bow (my will)
 To the Lord and Cherisher
 Of the Universe."

132. And this was the legacy
 That Abraham left to his sons,
 And so did Jacob;
 "Oh my sons! God hath chosen
 The Faith for you; then die not
 Except in the Faith of Islam."

133. Were ye witnesses
 When Death appeared before Jacob?
 Behold, he said to his sons:
 "What will ye worship after me?"
 They said: "We shall worship

Thy God and the God of thy fathers,--
 Of Abraham, Isma'il, and Isaac,--
 The One (True) God:
 To Him we bow (in Islam)."

134. That was a People that hath
 Passed away. They shall reap
 The fruit of what they did,
 And ye of what ye do!
 Of their merits
 There is no question in your case!

135. They say: "Become Jews
 Or Christians if ye would be guided
 (To salvation)." Say thou:
 "Nay! (I would rather) the Religion
 Of Abraham the True,
 And he joined not gods with God."

136. Say ye: "We believe
 In God, and the revelation
 Given to us, and to Abraham,
 Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob,
 And the Tribes, and that given
 To Moses and Jesus, and that given
 To (all) Prophets from their Lord:
 We make no difference
 Between one and another of them:
 And we bow to God (in Islam)."

137. So if they believe
 As ye believe, they are indeed
 On the right path; but if
 They turn back, it is they

Who are in schism; but God will
 Suffice thee as against them,
 And He is the All-Hearing,
 The All-Knowing.

138. (Our religion is)
 The Baptism of God:
 And who can baptize better
 Than God? And it is He
 Whom we worship.

139. Say: Will ye dispute
 With us about God, seeing
 That He is our Lord
 And your Lord; that we
 Are responsible for our doings
 And ye for yours; and that
 We are sincere (in our faith) In him?

140. Or do ye say that
 Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac,
 Jacob and the Tribes were
 Jews or Christians?
 Say: Do ye know better
 Than God? Ah! who
 Is more unjust than those
 Who conceal the testimony
 They have from God?
 But God is not unmindful
 Of what ye do!

141. That was a people that hath
 Passed away. They shall reap
 The fruit of what they did,
 And ye of what ye do!
 Of their merits
 There is no question in your case:

  

SECTION 17.

142. The Fools among the people
 Will say: "What hath turned
 Them from the Qibla to which
 They were used?" Say:
 To God belong both East and West:
 He guideth whom He will
 To a Way that is straight.

143. Thus have We made of you
 An Ummat justly balanced,
 That ye might be witnesses
 Over the nations,

And the Apostle a witness
 Over yourselves;
 And We appointed the Qibla
 To which thou wast used,
 Only to test those who followed
 The Apostle from those
 Who would turn on their heels
 (From the Faith). Indeed it was
 (A change) momentous, except
 To those guided by God.
 And never would God
 Make your faith of no effect.
 For God is to all people
 Most surely full of kindness,
 Most Merciful.

144. We see the turning
 Of thy face (for guidance)
 To the heavens: now
 Shall We turn thee
 To a Qibla that shall
 Please thee. Turn then
 Thy face in the direction
 Of the sacred Mosque:
 Wherever ye are, turn
 Your faces in that direction.

The people of the Book
 Know well that that is
 The truth from their Lord.
 Nor is God unmindful
 Of what they do.

145. Even if thou wert to bring
 To the people of the Book
 All the Signs (together),
 They would not follow
 Thy Qibla; nor art thou
 Going to follow their Qibla;
 Nor indeed will they follow
 Each other's Qibla. If thou
 After the knowledge hath reached thee,
 Wert to follow their (vain)
 Desires,--then wert thou
 Indeed (clearly) in the wrong.

146. The people of the Book
 Know this as they know
 Their own sons; but some
 Of them conceal the truth
 Which they themselves know.

147. The Truth is from thy Lord;
 So be not at all in doubt.

  

SECTION 18.

148. To each is a goal
 To which God turns him;
 Then strive together (as in a race)
 Towards all that is good.
 Wheresoever ye are,
 God will bring you
 Together, For God
 Hath power over all things.

149. From whencesoever
 Thou startest forth, turn
 Thy face in the direction
 Of the Sacred Mosque;
 That is indeed the truth
 From thy Lord. And God
 Is not unmindful
 Of what ye do.

150. So from whencesoever
 Thou startest forth, turn
 Thy face in the direction
 Of the Sacred Mosque;
 And wheresoever ye are,
 Turn your face thither:
 That there be no ground
 Of dispute against you
 Among the people,
 Except those of them that are
 Bent on wickedness; so fear
 Them not, but fear Me;
 And that I may complete
 My favours on you, and ye
 May (consent to) be guided;

151. A similar (favour
 Have ye already received)
 In that We have sent
 Among you an Apostle
 Of your own, rehearsing to you
 Our Signs, and sanctifying
 You, and instructing you
 In Scripture and Wisdom,
 And in new Knowledge.

152. Then do ye remember
 Me; I will remember
 You. Be grateful to Me,
 And reject not Faith.

  

SECTION 19.

153. O ye who believe! seek help
 With patient Perseverance
 And Prayer: for God is with those
 Who patiently persevere.

154. And say not of those
 Who are slain in the way

Of God: "They are dead."
 Nay, they are living,
 Though ye perceive (it) not.

155. Be sure we shall test you
 With something of fear
 And hunger, some loss
 In goods or lives or the fruits
 (Of your toil), but give
 Glad tidings to those
 Who patiently persevere,--

156. Who say, when afflicted
 With calamity: "To God
 We belong, and to Him
 Is our return":--

157. They are those on whom
 (Descend) blessings from God,
 And Mercy,
 And they are the ones
 That receive guidance.

158. Behold! Safa and Marwa
 Are among the Symbols
 Of God. So if those who visit
 The House in the Season
 Or at other times,
 Should compass them round,
 It is no sin in them.
 And if any one obeyeth his own

Impulse to Good,--
 Be sure that God
 Is He Who recogniseth
 And knoweth.

159. Those who conceal
 The clear (Signs) We have
 Sent down, and the Guidance,
 After We have made it
 Clear for the People
 In the Book,--on them
 Shall be God's curse,
 And the curse of those
 Entitled to curse,--

160. Except those who repent
 And make amends
 And openly declare (the Truth):
 To them I turn;
 For I am Oft-returning,
 Most Merciful.

161. Those who reject Faith,
 And die rejecting,--
 On them is God's curse,
 And the curse of angels,
 And of all mankind;

162. They will abide therein:
 Their penalty will not
 Be lightened, nor will
 Respite be their (lot).

163. And your God
 Is One God:
 There is no god
 But He,

Most Gracious,
 Most Merciful.

  

SECTION 20.

164. Behold! In the creation
 Of the heavens and the earth;
 In the alternation
 Of the Night and the Day;
 In the sailing of the ships
 Through the Ocean
 For the profit of mankind;
 In the rain which God
 Sends down from the skies,
 And the life which He gives therewith
 To an earth that is dead;
 In the beasts of all kinds
 That He scatters
 Through the earth;
 In the change of the winds,
 And the clouds which they
 Trail like their slaves
 Between the sky and the earth;--
 (Here) indeed are Signs
 For a people that are wise.

165. Yet there are men
 Who take (for worship)
 Others besides God,
 As equal (with God):

They love them
 As they should love God.
 But those of Faith are
 Overflowing in their love
 For God. If only
 The unrighteous could see,
 Behold, they would see
 The Penalty: that to God
 Belongs all power, and God
 Will strongly enforce
 The Penalty.

166 Then would those
 Who are followed
 Clear themselves of those
 Who follow (them):
 They would see the Penalty,
 And all relations
 Between them would be cut off.

167. And those who followed
 Would say: "If only
 We had one more chance,
 We would clear ourselves
 Of them, as they have
 Cleared themselves of us."
 Thus will God show them
 (The fruits of) their deeds
 As (nothing but) regrets.
 Nor will there be a way
 For them out of the Fire.

  

SECTION 21.

168. O ye people!
 Eat of what is on earth,
 Lawful and good;
 And do not follow
 The footsteps of the Evil One,
 For he is to you
 An avowed enemy.

169. For he commands you
 What is evil
 And shameful,
 And that ye should say
 Of God that of which
 Ye have no knowledge.

170. When it is said to them:
 "Follow what God hath revealed:"
 They say: "Nay! we shall follow
 The ways of our fathers."
 What! even though their fathers
 Were void of wisdom and guidance?

171. The parable of those
 Who reject Faith is
 As if one were to shout
 Like a goat-herd, to things
 That listen to nothing
 But calls and cries:
 Deaf, dumb, and blind,
 They are void of wisdom.

172 O ye who believe!
 Eat of the good things
 That We have provided for you,
 And be grateful to God,
 If it is Him ye worship.

173. He hath only forbidden you
 Dead meat, and blood,
 And the flesh of swine,
 And that on which

Any other name hath been invoked
 Besides that of God.
 But if one is forced by necessity,
 Without wilful disobedience,
 Nor transgressing due limits,--
 Then is he guiltless.
 For God is Oft-forgiving
 Most Merciful.

174. Those who conceal
 God's revelations in the Book,
 And purchase for them
 A miserable profit,--
 They swallow into themselves
 Naught but Fire;
 God will not address them
 On the Day of Resurrection,
 Nor purify them:
 Grievous will be
 Their Penalty.

175. They are the ones
 Who buy Error
 In place of Guidance
 And Torment in place
 Of Forgiveness.
 Ah! what boldness
 (They show) for the Fire!

176. (Their doom is) because
 God sent down the Book
 In truth but those who seek
 Causes of dispute in the Book

Are in a schism
 Far (from the purpose).

  

SECTION 22.

177. It is not righteousness
 That ye turn your faces
 Towards East or West;
 But it is righteousness--
 To believe in God
 And the Last Day,
 And the Angels,
 And the Book,
 And the Messengers;
 To spend of your substance,
 Out of love for Him,
 For your kin,
 For orphans,
 For the needy,
 For the wayfarer,
 For those who ask,
 And for the ransom of slaves;
 To be steadfast in prayer,
 And practice regular charity;
 To fulfil the contracts
 Which ye have made;

And to be firm and patient,
 In pain (or suffering)
 And adversity,
 And throughout
 All periods of panic.
 Such are the people
 Of truth, the God-fearing.

178. O ye who believe!
 The law of equality
 Is prescribed to you
 In cases of murder:
 The free for the free,
 The slave for the slave,
 The woman for the woman.
 But if any remission
 Is made by the brother
 Of the slain, then grant
 Any reasonable demand,
 And compensate him

With handsome gratitude.
 This is a concession
 And a Mercy
 From your Lord.
 After this whoever
 Exceeds the limits
 Shall be in grave penalty.

179. In the Law of Equality
 There is (saving of) Life
 To you, O ye men of understanding;
 That ye may
 Restrain yourselves.

180. It is prescribed,
 When death approaches
 Any of you, if he leave
 Any goods, that he make a bequest
 To parents and next of kin,
 According to reasonable usage;
 This is due
 From the God-fearing.

181. If anyone changes the bequest
 After hearing it,
 The guilt shall be on those
 Who make the change.
 For God hears and knows
 (All things).

182. But if anyone fears
 Partiality or wrong-doing
 On the part of the testator,
 And makes peace between

(The parties concerned),
 There is no wrong in him:
 For God is Oft-forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

  

SECTION 23.

183. O ye who believe!
 Fasting is prescribed to you
 As it was prescribed
 To those before you,
 That ye may (learn)
 Self-restraint,--

184. (Fasting) for a fixed
 Number of days;
 But if any of you is ill,
 Or on a journey,
 The prescribed number
 (Should be made up)
 From days later.
 For those who can do it
 (With hardship), is a ransom,
 The feeding of one
 That is indigent.
 But he that will give
 More, of his own free will,--
 It is better for him.
 And it is better for you
 That ye fast,
 If ye only knew.

185. Ramadhan is the (month)
 In which was sent down
 The Qur-an, as a guide
 To mankind, also clear (Signs)
 For guidance and judgment
 (Between right and wrong).
 So every one of you
 Who is present (at his home)
 During that month
 Should spend it in fasting,
 But if any one is ill,
 Or on a journey,
 The prescribed period
 (Should be made up)
 By days later.
 God intends every facility
 For you; He does not want
 To put you to difficulties.
 (He wants you) to complete
 The prescribed period,
 And to glorify Him
 In that He has guided you;
 And perchance ye shall be grateful.

186. When My servants
 Ask thee concerning Me,
 I am indeed
 Close (to them): I listen
 To the prayer of every
 Suppliant when he calleth on Me:
 Let them also, with a will,
 Listen to My call,
 And believe in Me:
 That they may walk
 In the right way.

187. Permitted to you,
 On the night of the fasts,
 Is the approach to your wives.
 They are your garments

And ye are their garments.
 God knoweth what ye
 Used to do secretly among yourselves;
 But He turned to you
 And forgave you;
 So now associate with them,
 And seek what God
 Hath ordained for you,
 And eat and drink,
 Until the white thread
 Of dawn appear to you
 Distinct from its black thread;
 Then complete your fast
 Till the night appears;
 But do not associate
 With your wives
 While ye are in retreat
 In the mosques. Those are
 Limits (set by) God:
 Approach not nigh thereto.
 Thus doth God make clear
 His Signs to men: that
 They may learn self-restraint.

188. And do not eat up
 Your property among yourselves
 For vanities, nor use it
 As bait for the judges,
 With intent that ye may
 Eat up wrongfully and knowingly

A little of (other) people's property.

  

SECTION 24.

189. They ask thee
 Concerning the New Moons.
 Say: They are but signs
 To mark fixed periods of time
 In (the affairs of) men,
 And for Pilgrimage.
 It is no virtue if ye enter
 Your houses from the back:
 It is virtue if ye fear God.
 Enter houses
 Through the proper doors:
 And fear God:
 That ye may prosper.

190. Fight in the cause of God
 Those who fight you,
 But do not transgress limits;
 For God loveth not transgressors.

191. And slay them
 Wherever ye catch them,
 And turn them out
 From where they have

Turned you out;
 For tumult and oppression
 Are worse than slaughter;
 But fight them not
 At the Sacred Mosque,
 Unless they (first)
 Fight you there;
 But if they fight you,
 Slay them.
 Such is the reward
 Of those who suppress faith.

192. But if they cease,
 God is Oft-forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

193. And fight them on
 Until there is no more
 Tumult or oppression,
 And there prevail
 Justice and faith in God;
 But if they cease,
 Let there be no hostility
 Except to those
 Who practise oppression.

194. The prohibited month
 For the prohibited month,--
 And so for all things prohibited,--
 There is the law of equality.
 If then any one transgresses
 The prohibition against you,
 Transgress ye likewise
 Against him.
 But fear God, and know
 That God is with those
 Who restrain themselves.

195. And spend of your substance
 In the cause of God,
 And make not your own hands
 Contribute to (your) destruction;
 But do good;
 For God loveth those
 Who do good.

196. And complete
 The .Hajj or 'umra 

In the service of God.
 But if ye are prevented
 (From completing it),
 Send an offering
 For sacrifice,
 Such as ye may find,
 And do not shave your heads
 Until the offering reaches
 The place of sacrifice.
 And if any of you is ill,
 Or has an ailment in his scalp,
 (Necessitating shaving),
 (He should) in compensation
 Either fast, or feed the poor,
 Or offer sacrifice;
 And when ye are
 In peaceful conditions (again),
 If any one wishes
 To continue the 'umra 
 On to the hajj,
 He must make an offering,
 Such as he can afford,
 But if he cannot afford it,
 He should fast
 Three days during the hajj
 And seven days on his return,
 Making ten days in all.
 This is for those
 Whose household
 Is not in (the precincts
 Of) the Sacred Mosque.
 And fear God,
 And know that God.
 Is strict in punishment?

  

SECTION 25.

197. For Hajj 
 Are the months well known.
 If any one undertakes
 That duty therein,
 Let there be no obscenity,
 Nor wickedness,
 Nor wrangling
 In the Hajj.
 And whatever good
 Ye do, (be sure)
 God knoweth it.
 And take a provision
 (With you) for the journey,
 But the best of provisions
 Is right conduct.
 So fear Me,
 O ye that are wise.

198. It is no crime in you
 If ye seek of the bounty
 Of your Lord (during pilgrimage).
 Then when ye pour down
 From (Mount) 'Arafat,
 Celebrate the praises of God
 At the Sacred Monument,

And celebrate His praises
 As He has directed you,
 Even though, before this,
 Ye went astray.

199. Then pass on
 At a quick pace from the place
 Whence it is usual
 For the multitude
 So to do, and ask
 For God's forgiveness.
 For God is Oft-forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

200. So when ye have
 Accomplished your holy rites,
 Celebrate the praises of God,
 As ye used to celebrate
 The praises of your fathers,--
 Yea, with far more
 Heart and soul.
 There are men who say:
 "Our ! Give us
 (Thy bounties) in this world!"
 But they will have
 No portion in the Hereafter.

201. And there are men who say:
 "Our Lord! Give us
 Good in this world
 And good in the Hereafter,
 And defend us
 From the torment
 Of the Fire!"

202. To these will be allotted
 What they have earned;
 And God is quick in account.

203. Celebrate the praises of God
 During the Appointed Days.
 But if any one hastens
 To leave in two days,
 There is no blame on him,
 And if any one stays on,
 There is no blame on him,
 If his aim is to do right.
 Then fear God, and know
 That ye will surely
 Be gathered unto Him.

204. There is the type of man
 Whose speech
 About this world's life
 May dazzle thee,
 And he calls God to witness
 About what is in his heart;
 Yet is he the most contentious
 Of enemies.

205. When he turns his back,
 His aim everywhere
 Is to spread mischief
 Through the earth and destroy
 Crops and cattle.
 But God loveth not mischief.

206. When it is said to him,
 "Fear God,"
 He is led by arrogance
 To (more) crime.

Enough for him is Hell;--
 An evil bed indeed
 (To lie on)!

207. And there is the type of man
 Who gives his life
 To earn the pleasure of God;
 And God is full of kindness
 To (His) devotees.

208. O ye who believe!
 Enter into Islam
 Whole-heartedly;
 And follow not
 The footsteps
 Of the Evil One;
 For he is to you
 An avowed enemy.

209. If ye backslide
 After the clear (Signs)
 Have come to you,
 Then know that God
 Is Exalted in Power, Wise.

210. Will they wait
 Until God comes to them
 In canopies of clouds,
 With angels (in His train)
 And the question
 Is (thus) settled?
 But to God
 Do all questions
 Go back (for decision).

  

SECTION 26.

211. Ask the Children of Israel
 How many Clear (Signs)

We have sent them.
 But if any one,
 After God's favour
 Has come to him,
 Substitutes (something else),
 God is strict in punishment.

212. The life of this world
 Is alluring to those
 Who reject faith,
 And they scoff at those
 Who believe.
 But the righteous
 Will be above them
 On the Day of Resurrection;
 For God bestows His abundance
 Without measure
 On whom He will.

213. Mankind was one single nation,
 And God sent Messengers
 With glad tidings and warnings;
 And with them He sent
 The Book in truth,
 To judge between people
 In matters wherein
 They differed;
 But the People of the Book,
 After the clear Signs
 Came to them, did not differ
 Among themselves,
 Except through selfish contumacy.
 God by His Grace
 Guided the Believers
 To the Truth,
 Concerning that
 Wherein they differed.
 For God guides
 Whom He will
 To a path
 That is straight.

214. Or do ye think
 That ye shall enter

The Garden (of Bliss)
 Without such (trials)
 As came to those
 Who passed away
 Before you?
 They encountered
 Suffering and adversity,
 And were so shaken in spirit
 That even the Apostle
 And those of faith
 Who were with him
 Cried: "When (will come)
 The help of God?"
 Ah! Verily, the help of God
 Is (always) near!

215. They ask thee
 What they should spend
 (In charity). Say: Whatever
 Ye spend that is good,
 Is for parents and kindred
 And orphans
 And those in want
 And for wayfarers.
 And whatever ye do
 That is good,--God
 Knoweth it well.

216. Fighting is prescribed
 For you, and ye dislike it.
 But it is possible
 That ye dislike a thing
 Which is good for you,
 And that ye love a thing
 Which is bad for you.
 But God knoweth,
 And ye know not.

  

SECTION 27.

217. They ask thee
 Concerning fighting
 In the Prohibited Month.
 Say: "Fighting therein
 Is a grave (offence);
 But graver is it
 In the sight of God
 To prevent access
 To the path of God,
 To deny Him,
 To prevent access
 To the Sacred Mosque,
 And drive out its members.
 Tumult and oppression
 Are worse than slaughter.
 Nor will they cease
 Fighting you until
 They turn you back
 From your faith
 If they can.
 And if any of you
 Turn back from their faith
 And die in unbelief,
 Their works will bear no fruit
 In this life
 And in the Hereafter;
 They will be
 Companions of the Fire
 And will abide therein.

218. Those who believed
 And those who suffered exile
 And fought (and strove and struggled)
 In the path of God,--
 They have the hope
 Of the Mercy of God;
 And God is Oft-forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

219. They ask thee
 Concerning wine and gambling.
 Say: "In them is great sin,
 And some profit, for men;
 But the sin is greater
 Than the profit."
 Whey ask thee how much
 They are to spend;
 Say: "What is beyond
 Your needs."
 Thus doth God
 Make clear to you
 His Signs: in order that
 Ye may consider--

220. (Their bearings) on
 This life and the Hereafter.

They ask thee
 Concerning orphans.
 Say: "The best thing to do
 Is what is for their good;
 If ye mix
 Their affairs with yours,
 They are your brethren;
 But God knows

The man who means mischief
 From the man who means good.
 And if God had wished,
 He could have put you
 Into difficulties: He is indeed
 Exalted in Power, Wise.

221. Do not marry
 Unbelieving women (idolaters),
 Until they believe:
 A slave woman who believes
 Is better than an unbelieving woman,
 Even though she allure you.
 Nor marry (your girls)
 To unbelievers until
 They believe:
 A man slave who believes
 Is better than an unbeliever,
 Even though he allure you.
 Unbelievers do (but)
 Beckon you to the Fire.
 But God beckons by His Grace
 To the Garden (of Bliss)
 And forgiveness,
 And makes His Signs
 Clear to mankind:
 That they may
 Celebrate His praise.

  

SECTION 28.

222. They ask thee
 Concerning women's courses.
 Say: They are
 A hurt and a pollution:

So keep away from women
 In their courses, and do not
 Approach them until
 They are clean.
 But when they have
 Purified themselves,
 Ye may approach them
 In any manner, time, or place
 Ordained for you by God.
 For God loves those
 Who turn to Him constantly
 And He loves those
 Who keep themselves pure and clean,

223. Your wives are
 As a tilth unto you;
 So approach your tilth
 When or how ye will;
 But do some good act
 For your souls beforehand;
 And fear God,
 And know that ye are
 To meet Him (in the Hereafter),
 And give (these) good tidings
 To those who believe.

224. And make not
 God's (name) an excuse
 In your oaths against
 Doing good, or acting rightly,
 Or making peace
 Between persons;

For God is One
 Who heareth and knoweth
 All things.

225. God will not
 Call you to account
 For thoughtlessness
 In your oaths,
 But for the intention
 In your hearts;
 And He is
 Oft-forgiving
 Most Forbearing.

226. For those who take
 An oath for abstention
 From their wives,
 A waiting for four months
 Is ordained;
 If then they return,
 God is Oft-forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

227. But if their intention
 Is firm for divorce,
 God heareth
 And knoweth all things.

228. Divorced women
 Shall wait concerning themselves

For three monthly periods.
 Nor is it lawful for them
 To hide what God
 Hath created in their wombs,
 If they have faith
 In God and the Last Day.
 And their husbands
 Have the better right
 To take them back
 In that period, if
 They wish for reconciliation.
 And women shall have rights
 Similar to the rights
 Against them, according
 To what is equitable;
 But men have a degree
 (Of advantage) over them.
 And God is Exalted in Power, Wise.

  

SECTION 29.

229. A divorce is only
 Permissible twice: after that,
 The parties should either hold
 Together on equitable terms,
 Or separate with kindness.
 It is not lawful for you,
 (Men), to take back
 Any of your gifts (from your wives)
 Except when both parties
 Fear that they would be
 Unable to keep the limits

Ordained by God.
 If ye (judges) do indeed
 Fear that they would be
 Unable to keep the limits
 Ordained by God,
 There is no blame on either
 Of them if she give
 Something for her freedom.
 These are the limits
 Ordained by God;
 So do not transgress them
 If any do transgress
 The limits ordained by God,
 Such persons wrong
 (Themselves as well as others).

230. So if a husband
 Divorces his wife (irrevocably),
 He cannot, after that,
 Re-marry her until
 After she has married
 Another husband and
 He has divorced her.
 In that case there is
 No blame on either of them
 If they re-unite, provided
 They feel that they
 Can keep the limits
 Ordained by God.
 Such are the limits
 Ordained by God,
 Which He makes plain
 To those who understand.

231. When ye divorce
 Women, and they fulfil

The term of their ('Iddat),
 Either take them back
 On equitable terms
 Or set them free
 On equitable terms;
 But do not take them back
 To injure them, (or) to take
 Undue advantage;
 If any one does that,
 He wrongs his own soul.
 Do not treat God's Signs
 As a jest,
 But solemnly rehearse
 God's favours on you,
 And the fact that He
 Sent down to you
 The Book
 And Wisdom,
 For your instruction.
 And fear God,
 And know that God
 Is well acquainted
 With all things.

  

SECTION 30.

232. When ye divorce
 Women, and they fulfil
 The term of their ('Iddat),
 Do not prevent them
 From marrying
 Their (former) husbands,
 If they mutually agree
 On equitable terms.
 This instruction
 Is for all amongst you,
 Who believe in God
 And the Last Day.
 That is (the course

Making for) most virtue
 And purity amongst you,
 And God knows,
 And ye know not.

233. The mothers shall give suck
 To their offspring
 For two whole years,
 If the father desires
 To complete the term.
 But he shall bear the cost
 Of their food and clothing
 On equitable terms.
 No soul shall have
 A burden laid on it
 Greater than it can bear.
 No mother shall be
 Treated unfairly
 On account of her child.
 Nor father
 On account of his child,
 An heir shall be chargeable
 In the same way.
 If they both decide
 On weaning,
 By mutual consent,
 And after due consultation,
 There is no blame on them.
 If ye decide
 On a foster-mother
 For your offspring,
 There is no blame on you,
 Provided ye pay (the mother)
 What ye offered,
 On equitable terms.
 But fear God and know
 That God sees well
 What ye do.

234. If any of you die
 And leave widows behind,

They shall wait concerning themselves
 Four months and ten days:
 When they have fulfilled
 Their term, there is no blame
 On you if they dispose
 Of themselves in a just
 And reasonable manner.
 And God is well acquainted
 With what ye do.

235. There is no blame
 On you if ye make
 An offer of betrothal
 Or hold it in your hearts.
 God knows that ye
 Cherish them in your hearts:
 But do not make a secret contract
 With them except in terms
 Honourable, nor resolve on the tie
 Of marriage till the term
 Prescribed is fulfilled.
 And know that God
 Knoweth what is in your hearts,
 And take heed of Him;
 And know that God is
 Oft-forgiving, Most Forbearing.

  

SECTION 31.

236. There is no blame on you
 If ye divorce women
 Before consummation
 Or the fixation of their dower;
 But bestow on them
 (A suitable gift),
 The wealthy
 According to his means,
 And the poor
 According to his means;--

A gift of a reasonable amount
 Is due from those
 Who wish to do the right thing.

237. And if ye divorce them
 Before consummation,
 But after the fixation
 Of a dower for them,
 Then the half of the dower
 (Is due to them), unless
 They remit it
 Or (the man's half) is remitted
 By him in whose hands
 Is the marriage tie;
 And the remission
 (Of the man's half)
 Is the nearest to righteousness.
 And do not forget
 Liberality between yourselves.
 For God sees well
 All that ye do.

238. Guard strictly
 Your (habit of) prayers,
 Especially the Middle Prayer;
 And stand before God
 In a devout (frame of mind).

239. If ye fear (an enemy),
 Pray on foot, or riding,
 (As may be most convenient),
 But when ye are
 In security, celebrate
 God's praises in the manner
 He has taught you,
 Which ye knew not (before).

240. Those of you
 Who die and leave widows
 Should bequeath
 For their widows
 A year's maintenance
 And residence;
 But if they leave
 (The residence),
 There is no blame on you
 For what they do
 With themselves,
 Provided it is reasonable.
 And God is Exalted in Power, Wise.

241. For divorced women
 Maintenance (should be provided)
 On a reasonable (scale).
 This is a duty
 On the righteous.

242. Thus doth God
 Make clear His Signs
 To you: in order that
 Ye may understand.

  

SECTION 32.

243. Didst thou not
 Turn by vision to those
 Who abandoned their homes,
 Though they were thousands
 (In number), for fear of death?
 God said to them: "Die":
 Then He restored them to life.
 For God is full of bounty
 To mankind, but
 Most of them are ungrateful.

244. Then fight in the cause
 Of God, and know that God
 Heareth and knoweth all things.

245. Who is he
 That will loan to God
 A beautiful loan, which God
 Will double unto his credit
 And multiply many times?
 It is God that giveth (you)
 Want or Plenty,
 And to Him shall be
 Your return.

246. Hast thou not
 Turned thy vision to the Chiefs
 Of the Children of Israel
 After (the time of) Moses?

They said to a Prophet
 (That was) among them:
 "Appoint for us a King, that we
 May fight in the cause of God."
 He said: "Is it not possible,
 If ye were commanded
 To fight, that that ye
 Will not fight?" They said:
 "How could we refuse
 To fight in the cause of God,
 Seeing that we were turned out
 Of our homes and our families?"
 But when they were commanded
 To fight, they turned back,
 Except a small band
 Among them. But God
 Has full knowledge of those
 Who do wrong.

247. Their Prophet said to them:
 "God hath appointed
 Talut as king over you."
 They said: "How can he
 Exercise authority over us
 When we are better fitted
 Than he to exercise authority,
 And he is not even gifted,
 With wealth in abundance?"
 He said: "God hath
 Chosen him above you,
 And hath gifted him
 Abundantly with knowledge
 And bodily prowess: God

Granteth His authority to whom
 He pleaseth. God careth
 For all, and He knoweth
 All things."

248. And (further) their Prophet
 Said to them: "A Sign
 Of his authority
 Is that there shall come
 To you the Ark of the Covenant,
 With (an assurance) therein
 Of security from your Lord,
 And the relics left
 By the family of Moses
 And the family of Aaron,
 Carried by angels.
 In this is a Symbol
 For you if ye indeed
 Have faith."

  

SECTION 33.

249. When Talut set forth
 With the armies, he said:
 "God will test you
 At the stream: if any
 Drinks of its water,
 He goes not with my army:
 Only those who taste not
 Of it go with me:
 A mere sip out of the hand
 Is excused." But they all
 Drank of it, except a few.
 When they crossed the river,--
 He and the faithful ones with him,
 They said: "This day
 We cannot cope
 With Goliath and his forces."

But those who were convinced
 That they must meet God,
 Said: "How oft, by God's will,
 Hath a small force
 Vanquished a big one?
 God is with those
 Who steadfastly persevere."

250. When they advanced
 To meet Goliath and his forces,
 They prayed: "Our Lord
 Pour out constancy on us
 And make our steps firm:
 Help us against those
 That reject faith."

251. By God's will,
 They routed them;
 And David slew Goliath;
 And God gave him
 Power and wisdom
 And taught him
 Whatever (else) He willed,
 And did not God
 Check one set of people
 By means of another,
 The earth would indeed
 Be full of mischief:
 But God is full of bounty
 To all the worlds.

252. These are the Signs
 Of God: we rehearse them
 To thee in truth: verily
 Thou art one of the Apostles.

253. Those apostles
 Were endowed with gifts,
 Some above others
 To one of them God spoke;
 Others He raised
 To degrees (of honour);
 To Jesus the son of Mary
 We gave Clear (Signs),
 And strengthened him
 With the holy spirit.
 If God had so willed,
 Succeeding generations
 Would not have fought
 Among each other, after
 Clear (Signs) had come to them,
 But they (chose) to wrangle,
 Some believing and Others
 Rejecting. If God had so willed,
 They would not have fought
 Each other; but God
 Fulfilleth His plan.

  

SECTION 34.

254. O ye who believe!
 Spend out of (the bounties)
 We have provided for you,
 Before the Day comes
 When no bargaining
 (Will avail), nor friendship
 Nor intercession.
 Those who reject Faith--they
 Are the wrong-doers.

255. God! There is no god
 But He,--the Living,
 The Self-subsisting, Eternal.
 No slumber can seize Him
 Nor sleep. His are all things
 In the heavens and on earth.
 Who is there can intercede
 In His presence except
 As He permitteth? He knoweth
 What (appeareth to His creatures

As) Before or After
 Or Behind them.
 Nor shall they compass
 Aught of His knowledge
 Except as He willeth.
 His Throne doth extend
 Over the heavens
 And the earth, and He feeleth
 No fatigue in guarding,
 And preserving them
 For He is the Most High,
 The Supreme (in glory).

256. Let there be no compulsion
 In religion: Truth stands out
 Clear from Error: whoever
 Rejects Evil and believes
 In God hath grasped
 The most trustworthy
 Hand-hold, that never breaks.
 And God heareth
 And knoweth all things.

257. God is the Protector
 Of those who have faith:

From the depths of darkness
 He will lead them forth
 Into light. Of those
 Who reject faith the patrons
 Are the Evil Ones: from light
 They will lead them forth
 Into the depths of darkness.
 They will be Companions
 Of the fire, to dwell therein
 (For ever).

  

SECTION 35.

258. Hast thou not
 Turned thy vision to one
 Who disputed with Abraham
 About his Lord, because
 God had granted him
 Power? Abraham said:
 "My Lord is He Who
 Giveth life and death."
 He said: "I give life and death."
 Said Abraham: "But it is God
 That causeth the sun
 To rise from the East:
 Do thou then cause him
 To rise from the West."
 Thus was he confounded
 Who (in arrogance) rejected
 Faith. Nor doth God
 Give guidance
 To a people unjust.

259. Or (take) the similitude
 Of one who passed

By a hamlet, all in ruins
 To its roofs. He said:
 "Oh! how shall God
 Bring it (ever) to life,
 After (this) its death?"
 But God caused him
 To die for a hundred years,
 Then raised him up (again).
 He said: "How long
 Didst thou tarry (thus)?"
 He said: "(Perhaps) a day
 Or part of a day." He said:
 "Nay, thou hast tarried
 Thus a hundred years;
 But look at thy food
 And thy drink; they show
 No signs of age; and look
 At thy donkey: and that
 We may make of thee
 A Sign unto the people,
 Look further at the bones,
 How We bring them together
 And clothe them with flesh."
 When this was shown clearly
 To him, he said: "I know
 That God hath power
 Over all things."

260. Behold! Abraham said:
 "My Lord! Show me how
 Thou givest life to the dead."
 He said: "Dost thou not
 Then believe?" He said:
 "Yea! but to satisfy

My own understanding."
 He said: "Take four birds;
 Tame them to turn to thee;
 Put a portion of them
 On every hill, and call to them:
 They will come to thee
 (Flying) with speed.
 Then know that God
 Is Exalted in Power, Wise."

  

SECTION 36.

261. The parable of those
 Who spend their substance
 In the way of God is that
 Of a grain of corn: it groweth
 Seven ears, and each ear
 Hath a hundred grains.
 God giveth manifold increase
 To whom He pleaseth:
 And God careth for all
 And He knoweth all things

262. Those who spend
 Their substance in the cause
 Of God, and follow not up
 Their gifts with reminders
 Of their generosity
 Or with injury,--for them
 Their reward is with their Lord:
 On them shall be no fear,
 Nor shall they grieve.

263. Kind words
 And the covering of faults

Are better than charity
 Followed by injury.
 God is Free of all wants,
 And He is most Forbearing.

264. O ye who believe!
 Cancel not your charity
 By reminders of your generosity
 Or by injury,--like those
 Who spend their substance
 To be seen of men,
 But believe neither
 In God nor in the Last Day.
 They are in Parable like a hard,
 Barren rock, on which
 Is a little soil: on it
 Falls heavy rain,
 Which leaves it
 (Just) a bare stone.
 They will be able to do nothing
 With aught they have earned.
 And God guideth not
 Those who reject faith.

265. And the likeness of those
 Who spend their substance,
 Seeking to please God
 And to strengthen their souls,
 Is as a garden, high
 And fertile: heavy rain
 Falls on it but makes it yield
 A double increase
 Of harvest, and if it receives not
 Heavy rain, light moisture
 Sufficeth it. God seeth well
 Whatever ye do.

266. Does any of you wish
 That he should have a garden
 With date-palms and vines
 And streams flowing
 Underneath, and all kinds
 Of fruit, while he is stricken
 With old age, and his children
 Are not strong (enough
 To look after themselves)--
 That it should be caught
 In a whirlwind,
 With fire therein,
 And be burnt up?
 Thus doth God make clear
 To you (His) Signs;
 That ye may consider.

  

SECTION 37.

267. O ye who believe!
 Give of the good things
 Which ye have (honourably) earned,
 And of the fruits of the earth
 Which We have produced

For you, and do not even aim
 At getting anything
 Which is bad, in order that
 Out of it ye may give away
 Something, when ye yourselves
 Would not receive it
 Except with closed eyes.
 And know that God
 Is Free of all wants,
 And Worthy of all praise.

268. The Evil One threatens
 You with poverty
 And bids you to conduct
 Unseemly. God promiseth
 You His forgiveness
 And bounties.
 And God careth for all
 And He knoweth all things.

269. He granteth wisdom
 To whom He pleaseth;
 And he to whom wisdom
 Is granted receiveth
 Indeed a benefit overflowing;
 But none will grasp the Message
 But men of understanding.

270. And whatever ye spend
 In charity or devotion,
 Be sure God knows it all.
 But the wrong-doers
 Have no helpers.

271. If ye disclose (acts
 Of) charity, even so
 It is well,
 But if ye conceal them,
 And make them reach
 Those (really) in need,
 That is best for you:
 It will remove from you
 Some of your (stains
 Of) evil. And God
 Is well acquainted
 With what ye do.

272. It is not required
 Of thee (O Apostle),
 To set them on the right path,
 But God sets on the right path
 Whom He pleaseth.
 Whatever of good ye give
 Benefits your own souls,
 And ye shall only do so
 Seeking the "Face"
 Of God. Whatever good
 Ye give, shall be
 Rendered back to you,
 And ye shall not
 Be dealt with unjustly.

273. (Charity is) for those
 In need, who, in God's cause
 Are restricted (from travel),
 And cannot move about

In the land, seeking
 (For trade or work):
 The ignorant man thinks,
 Because of their modesty,
 That they are free from want.
 Thou shaltknow them
 By their (unfailing) mark:
 They beg not importunately
 From all and sundry.
 And whatever of good
 Ye give, be assured
 God knoweth it well.

  

SECTION 38.

274. Whose who (in charity)
 Spend of their goods
 By night and by day,
 In secret and in public,
 Have their reward
 With their Lord:
 On them shall be no fear,
 Nor shall they grieve.

275. Those who devour usury
 Will not stand except
 As stands one whom
 The Evil One by his touch
 Hath driven to madness.
 That is because they say:
 "Trade is like usury,"
 But God hath permitted trade

And forbidden usury.
 Those who after receiving
 Direction from their Lord,
 Desist, shall be pardoned
 For the past; their case
 Is for God (to judge);
 But those who repeat
 (The offence) are Companions
 Of the Fire: they will
 Abide therein (for ever).

276. God will deprive
 Usury of all blessing,
 But will give increase
 For deeds of charity:
 For He loveth not
 Creatures ungrateful
 And wicked.

277. Those who believe,
 And do deeds of righteousness,
 And establish regular prayers
 And regular charity,
 Will have their reward
 With their Lord:
 On them shall be no fear,
 Nor shall they grieve.

278. O ye who believe!
 Fear God, and give up
 What remains of your demand
 For usury, if ye are
 Indeed believers.

279. If ye do it not,
 Take notice of war
 From God and His Apostle:
 But if ye turn back,
 Ye shall have
 Your capital sums:
 Deal not unjustly,
 And ye shall not
 Be dealt with unjustly.

280. If the debtor is
 In a difficulty,
 Grant him time
 Till it is easy
 For him to repay.
 But if ye remit it
 By way of charity,
 That is best for you
 If ye only knew.

281. And fear the Day
 When ye shall be
 Brought back to God.
 Then shall every soul
 Be paid what it earned,
 And none shall be
 Dealt with unjustly.

  

SECTION 39.

282. O ye who believe!
 When ye deal with each other,
 In transactions involving
 Future obligations
 In a fixed period of time,
 Reduce them to writing
 Let a scribe write down
 Faithfully as between
 The parties: let not the scribe
 Refuse to write: as God
 Has taught him,
 So let him write.
 Let him who incurs
 The liability dictate,
 But let him fear
 His Lord God,
 And not diminish
 Aught of what he owes.
 If the party liable
 Is mentally deficient,

Or weak, or unable
 Himself to dictate,
 Let his guardian
 Dictate faithfully.
 And get two witnesses,
 Out of your own men,
 And if there are not two men,
 Then a man and two women,
 Such as ye choose,
 For witnesses,
 So that if one of them errs,
 The other can remind her.
 The witnesses
 Should not refuse
 When they are called on
 (For evidence).
 Disdain not to reduce
 To writing (your contract)
 For a future period,
 Whether it be small
 Or big: it is juster
 In the sight of God,
 More suitable as evidence,
 And more convenient
 To prevent doubts
 Among yourselves
 But if it be a transaction
 Which ye carry out
 On the spot among yourselves,
 There is no blame on you
 If ye reduce it not
 To writing.
 But take witnesses
 Whenever ye make
 A commercial contract;
 And let neither scribe
 Nor witness suffer harm.
 If ye do (such harm),
 It would be wickedness
 In you. So fear God;
 For it is God
 That teaches you.
 And God is well acquainted
 With all things.

283. If ye are on a journey,
 And cannot find
 A scribe, a pledge
 With possession (may serve
 The purpose).
 And if one of you
 Deposits a thing
 On trust with another,
 Let the trustee
 (Faithfully) discharge
 His trust, and let him
 Fear his Lord.
 Conceal not evidence;
 For whoever conceals it,--
 His heart is tainted
 With sin. And God
 Knoweth all that ye do.

  

SECTION 40.

284. To God belongeth all
 That is in the heavens
 And on earth. Whether
 Ye show what is in your minds
 Or conceal it, God
 Calleth you to account for it.

He forgiveth whom He pleaseth,
 And punishefh whom He pleaseth.
 For God hath power
 Over all things.

285. The Apostle believeth
 In what hath been revealed
 To him from his Lord,
 As do the men of faith.
 Each one (of them) believeth
 In God, His angels,
 His books, and His apostles.
 "We make no distinction (they say)
 Between one and another
 Of His apostles." And they say:
 "We hear, and we obey:
 (We seek) Thy forgiveness,
 Our Lord, and to Thee
 Is the end of all journeys."

286. On no soul doth God
 Place a burden greater
 Than it can bear.
 It gets every good that it earns,
 And it suffers every ill that if earns.
 (Pray:) "Our Lord!
 Condemn us not
 If we forget or fall
 Into error; our Lord!
 Lay not on us a burden
 Like that which Thou
 Didst lay on those before us;

Our Lord! lay not on us
 A burden greater than we
 Have strength to bear.
 Blot out our sins,
 And grant us forgiveness,
 Have mercy on us.
 Thou art our Protector;
 Help us against those
 Who stand against Faith"



  

Sura III.

  

Al-i-'Imran, or The Family of 'Imran.



1. A. L. M.

2. God! There is no god
 But He,--the Living,
 The Self-Subsisting, Eternal.

3. It is He Who sent down
 To thee (step by step),
 In truth, the Book,
 Confirming what went before it;
 And He sent down the Law
 (Of Moses) and the Gospel
 (Of Jesus) before this,
 As a guide to mankind,
 And He sent down the Criterion
 (Of judgment between right and wrong).

4. Then those who reject
 Faith in the Signs of God
 Will suffer the severest
 Penalty, and God
 Is Exalted in Might,
 Lord of Retribution.

5. From God, verily
 Nothing is hidden
 On earth or in the heavens.

6. He it is Who shapes you
 In the wombs as He pleases.

There is no god but He,
 The Exalted in Might,
 The Wise.

7. He it is Who has sent down
 To thee the Book:
 In it are verses
 Basic or fundamental
 (Of established meaning);
 They are the foundation
 Of the Book: others
 Are allegorical. But those
 In whose hearts is perversity follow
 The part thereof that is allegorical,
 Seeking discord, and searching
 For its hidden meanings,
 But to one knows
 Its hidden meanings except God.
 And those who are firmly grounded
 In knowledge say: "We believe
 In the Book; the whole of it
 Is from our Lord:" and none
 Will grasp the Message
 Except men of understanding.

8. "Our Lord!" (they say),
 "Let not our hearts deviate
 Now after Thou hast guided us,
 But grant us mercy
 From Thine own Presence;
 For Thou art the Grantor
 Of bounties without measure.

9. "Our Lord! Thou art He
 That will gather mankind
 Together against a Day about which
 There is no doubt; for God
 Never fails in His promise."

  

SECTION 2.

10. Whose who reject Faith,--
 Neither their possessions
 Nor their (numerous) progeny
 Will avail them aught
 Against God: they are themselves
 But fuel for the Fire.

11. (Their plight will be)
 No better than that
 Of the people of Pharaoh,
 And their predecessors:
 They denied our Signs,
 And God called them to account
 For their sins.
 For God is strict
 In punishment.

12. Say to those who reject Faith:
 "Soon will ye be vanquished
 And gathered together
 To Hell,--an evil bed
 Indeed (to lie on)!

13. "There has already been
 For you a Sign

In the two armies
 That met (in combat):
 One was fighting in the Cause
 Of God, the other
 Resisting God; these saw
 With their own eyes
 Twice their number.
 But God doth support
 With His aid whom He pleaseth.
 In this is a warning
 For such as have eyes to see."

14. Fair in the eyes of men
 Is the love of things they covet:
 Women and sons;
 Heaped-up hoards
 Of gold and silver; horses
 Branded (for blood and excellence);
 And (wealth of) cattle
 And well-tilled land.
 Such are the possessions
 Of this world's life;
 But in nearness to God
 Is the best of the goals
 (To return to).

15. Say: Shall I give you
 Glad tidings of things
 Far better than those?
 For the righteous are Gardens

In nearness to their Lord,
 With rivers flowing beneath;
 Therein is their eternal home;
 With Companions pure (and holy);
 And the good pleasure of God.
 For in God's sight
 Are (all) His servants,--

16. (Namely), those who say:
 "Our Lord! we have indeed
 Believed: forgive us, then,
 Our sins, and save us
 From the agony of the Fire;"--

17. Those who show patience,
 Firmness and self control;
 Who are true (in word and deed);
 Who worship devoutly;
 Who spend (in the way of God);
 And who pray for forgiveness
 In the early hours of the morning.

18. There is no god but He
 That is the witness of God,
 His angels, and those endued
 With knowledge, standing firm
 On justice. There is no god but He,
 The Exalted in Power,
 The Wise.

19. The Religion before God
 Is Islam (submission to His Will):
 Nor did the People of the Book
 Dissent therefrom except

Through envy of each other,
 After knowledge had come to them.
 But if any deny the Signs of God,
 God is swift in calling to account.

20. So if they dispute with thee,
 Say: "I have submitted
 My whole self to God
 And so have those
 Who follow me."
 And say to the People of the Book
 And to those who are unlearned:
 "Do ye (also) submit yourselves?"
 If they do, they are in right guidance,
 But if they turn back,
 Thy duty is to convey the Message;
 And in God's sight
 Are (all) His servants.

  

SECTION 3.

21. As to those who deny
 The Signs of God, and in defiance

Of right, slay the prophets,
 And slay those who teach
 Just dealing whith mankind,
 Announce to them a grievous penalty.

22. They are those whose works
 Will bear no fruit
 In this world
 And in the Hereafter,
 Nor will they have
 Anyone to help.

23. Hast thou not turned
 Thy vision to those
 Who have been given a portion
 Of the Book? They are
 Invited to the Book of God,
 To settle their dispute,
 But a party of them
 Turn back and decline
 (The arbitration).

24. This because they say:
 "The Fire shall not touch us
 But for a few numbered days":
 For their forgeries deceive them
 As to their own religion.

25. But how (will they fare)
 When We gather them together

Against a Day about which
 There is no doubt,
 And each soul will be paid out
 Just what it has earned,
 Without (favour or) injustice?

26. Say: "O God!
 Lord of Power (and Rule),
 Thou givest Power
 To whom Thou pleasest,
 And Thou strippest off Power
 From whom Thou pleasest:
 Thou enduest with honour
 Whom Thou pleasest,
 And Thou bringest low
 Whom Thou pleasest:
 In Thy hand is all Good."
 Verily, over all things
 Thou hast power.

27. "Thou causest the Night
 To gain on the Day,
 And Thou causest the Day
 To gain on the Night;
 Thou bringest the Living
 Out of the Dead,
 And Thou bringest the Dead
 Out of the Living;
 And Thou givest sustenance
 To whom Thou pleasest,
 Without measure."

28. let not the Believers
 Take for friends or helpers

Unbelievers rather than
 Believers: if any do that,
 In nothing will there be help
 From God: except by way
 Of precaution, that ye may
 Guard yourselves from them,
 But God cautions you
 (To remember) Himself;
 For the final goal
 Is to God.

29. Say: "Whether ye hide
 What is in your hearts
 Or reveal it,
 God knows it all:
 He knows what is
 In the heavens,
 And what is on earth.
 And God has power
 Over all things.

30. "On the Day when every soul
 Will be confronted
 With all the good it has done,
 And all the evil it has done,
 It will wish there were
 A great distance
 Between it and its evil.
 But God cautions you
 (To remember) Himself.
 And God is full of kindness
 To those that serve Him."

  

SECTION 4.

31. Say: "If ye do love God,
 Follow me: God will love you
 And forgive you your sins:
 For God is Oft-Forgiving,
 Most Merciful."

32. Say: "Obey God
 And His Apostle":
 But if they turn back,
 God loveth not those
 Who reject Faith.

33. God did choose
 Adam and Noah, the family
 Of Abraham, and the family
 Of 'Imran above all people,--

34. Offspring, one of the other:
 And God heareth
 And knoweth all things.

35. Behold! a woman of 'Imran
 Said: "O my Lord! I do

Dedicate unto Thee
 What is in my womb
 For Thy special service:
 So accept this of me:
 For Thou hearest
 And knowest all things."

36. When she was delivered,
 She said: "O my Lord!
 Behold! I am delivered
 Of a female child!"--
 And God knew best
 What she brought forth--
 "And nowise is the male
 Like the female.
 I have named her Mary,
 And I commend her
 And her offspring
 To Thy protection
 From the Evil One,
 The Rejected."

37. Right graciously
 Did her Lord accept her:
 He made her grow
 In purity and beauty:
 To the care of Zakariya
 Was she assigned.
 Every time that he entered
 (Her) chamber to see her,
 He found her supplied
 With sustenance. He said:
 "O Mary! Whence (comes) this
 To you?" She said:
 "From God: for God
 Provides sustenance
 To whom He pleases,
 Without measure."

38. There here did Zakariya
 Pray to his Lord, saying:
 "O my Lord! Grant unto me
 From Thee a progeny
 That is pure: for Thou
 Art He that heareth prayer!

39. While he was standing
 In prayer in the chamber,
 The angels called unto him:
 "God doth give thee
 Glad tidings of Yahya,
 Witnessing the truth
 Of a Word from God, and (be
 Besides) noble, chaste,
 And a Prophet,
 Of the (goodly) company
 Of the righteous."

40. He said: "O my Lord!
 How shall I have a son,
 Seeing I am very old,
 And my wife is barren?"
 "Thus, "was the answer,
 "Doth God accomplish
 What He willeth,"

41. He said: "O my Lord!
 Give me a Sign!"
 "Thy Sign, "was the answer,
 "Shall be that thou
 Shalt speak to no man
 For three days
 But with signals.
 Then celebrate
 The praises of thy Lord
 Again and again,
 And glorify Him
 In the evening
 And in the morning."

  

SECTION 5.

42. Behold! the angels said:
 "O Mary! God hath chosen thee
 And purified thee--chosen thee
 Above the women of all nations.

43. "O Mary! worship
 Thy Lord devoutly:
 Prostrate thyself,
 And bow down (in prayer)
 With those who bow down."

44. This is part of the tidings
 Of the things unseen,
 Which We reveal unto thee
 (O Apostle!) by inspiration:
 Thou wast not with them
 When they cast lots
 With arrows, as to which
 Of them should be charged
 With the care of Mary:
 Nor wast thou with them
 When they disputed (the point).

45. Behold! the angels said:
 "O Mary! God giveth thee
 Glad tidings of a Word
 From Him: his name
 Will be Christ Jesus,
 The son of Mary, held in honour
 In this world and the Hereafter
 And of (the company of) those
 Nearest to God;

46. "He shall speak to the people
 In childhood and in maturity.
 And he shall be (of the company)
 Of the righteous."

47. She said: "O my Lord!
 How shall I have a son
 When no man hath touched me?"
 He said: "Even so:
 God createth
 What He willeth:
 When He hath decreed
 A Plan, He but saith
 To it, 'Be,' and it is!

48. "And God will teach him
 The Book and Wisdom,
 The Law and the Gospel,

49. "And (appoint him)
 An apostle to the Children
 Of Israel, (with this message):
 "'I have come to you,
 With a Sign from your Lord,
 In that I make for you
 Out of clay, as it were,
 The figure of a bird,
 And breathe into it,
 And it becomes a bird
 By God's leave:
 And I heal those
 Born blind, and the lepers,
 And I quicken the dead,
 By God's leave;
 And I declare to you
 What ye eat, and what ye store
 In your houses. Surely
 Therein is a Sign for you
 If ye did believe;

50. "'(I have come to you),
 To attest the Law
 Which was before me.
 And to make lawful
 To you part of what was
 (Before) forbidden to you;
 I have come to you
 With a Sign from your Lord.
 So fear God,
 And obey me.

51. "'It is God
 Who is my Lord
 And your Lord;
 Then worship Him.
 This is a Way
 That is straight.'"

52. When Jesus found
 Unbelief on their part
 He said: "Who will be
 My helpers to (the work
 Of) God?" Said the Disciples:
 "We are God's helpers:
 We believe in God,
 And do thou bear witness
 That we are Muslims.

53. "Our Lord! we believe
 In what Thou hast revealed,
 And we follow the Apostle;
 Then write us down
 Among those who bear witness."

54. And (the unbelievers)
 Plotted and planned,
 And God too planned,
 And the best of planners
 Is God.

  

SECTION 6.

55. Behold! God said:
 "O Jesus! I will take thee
 And raise thee to Myself
 And clear thee (of the falsehoods)
 Of those who blaspheme;
 I will make those
 Who follow thee superior
 To those who reject faith,
 To the Day of Resurrection:
 Then shall ye all
 Return unto me,
 And I will judge
 Between you of the matters
 Wherein ye dispute.

56. "As to those who reject faith,
 I will punish them
 With terrible agony
 In this world and in the Hereafter,
 Nor will they have
 Anyone to help.

57. "As to those who believe
 And work righteousness,
 God will pay them (in full)
 Their reward;
 But God loveth not
 Those who do wrong.

58. "This is what we rehearse
 Unto thee of the Signs
 And the Message
 Of Wisdom."

59. The similitude of Jesus
 Before God is as that of Adam;
 He created him from dust,
 Then said to him, "Be":
 And he was.

60. The Truth (comes)
 From God alone;
 So be not of those
 Who doubt.

61. If any one disputes
 In this matter with thee,
 Now after (full) knowledge
 Hath come to thee,
 Say: "Come! let us
 Gather together,
 Our sons and your sons,
 Our women and your women,
 Ourselves and yourselves:
 Then let us earnestly pray,
 And invoke the curse
 Of God on those who lie!"

62. This is the true account:
 There is no god
 Except God;
 And God--He is indeed

The Exalted in Power,
 The Wise.

63. But if they turn back,
 God hath full knowledge
 Of those who do mischief.

  

SECTION 7.

64. Say: "O People
 Of the Book! come
 To common terms
 As between us and you:
 That we worship
 None but God;
 That we associate
 No partners with Him;
 That we erect not,
 From among ourselves,
 Lords and patrons
 Other than God."
 If then they turn back,
 Say ye: "Bear witness
 That we (at least)
 Are Muslims (bowing
 To God's Will)."

65. Ye People of the Book!
 Why dispute ye
 About Abraham,
 When the Law and the Gospel
 Were not revealed
 Till after him?
 Have ye no understanding?

66. Ah! Ye are those
 Who fell to disputing
 (Even) in matters of which
 Ye had some knowledge!
 But why dispute ye
 In matters of which
 Ye have no knowledge?
 It is God Who knows,
 And ye who know not!

67. Abraham was not a Jew
 Nor yet a Christian;
 But he was true in Faith,
 And bowed his will to God's,
 (Which is Islam),
 And he joined not gods with God.

68. Without doubt, among men,
 The nearest of kin to Abraham,
 Are those who follow him,
 As are also this Apostle
 And those who believe:
 And God is the Protector
 Of those who have faith.

69. It is the wish of a section
 Of the People of the Book
 To lead you astray.
 But they shall lead astray
 (Not you), but themselves,
 And they do not perceive!

70. Ye People of the Book!
 Why reject ye

The Signs of God,
 Of which ye are
 (Yourselves) witnesses?

71. Ye People of the Book!
 Why do ye clothe
 Truth with falsehood,
 And conceal the Truth,
 While ye have knowledge?

  

SECTION 8.

72. A section of the People
 Of the Book say:
 "Believe in the morning
 What is revealed
 To the Believers,
 But reject it at the end
 Of the day; perchance
 They may (themselves)
 Turn back;

73. "And believe no one
 Unless he follows
 Your religion."
 Say: "True guidance
 Is the guidance of God:
 (Fear ye) lest a revelation
 Be sent to someone (else)
 Like unto that which was sent
 Unto you? Or that those
 (Receiving such revelation)
 Should engage you in argument
 Before your Lord?"
 Say: "All bounties
 Are in the hand of God:
 He granteth them
 To whom He pleaseth:

And God careth for all,
 And He knoweth all things."

74. For His Mercy He specially chooseth
 Whom He pleaseth;
 For God is the Lord
 Of bounties unbounded.

75. Among the People of the Book
 Are some who, if entrusted
 With a hoard of gold,
 Will (readily) pay it back;
 Others, who, if entrusted
 With a single silver coin,
 Will not repay it unless
 Thou constantly stoodest
 Demanding, because,
 They say, "there is no call
 On us (to keep faith)
 With these ignorant (Pagans)."
 But they tell a lie against God,
 And (well) they know it.

76. Nay.--Those that keep
 Their plighted faith
 And act aright,--verily
 God loves those
 Who act aright.

77. As for those who sell
 The faith they owe to God
 And their own plighted word
 For a small price,
 They shall have no portion
 In the Hereafter:

Nor will God
 (Deign to) speak to them
 Or look at them
 On the Day of Judgment,
 Nor will He cleanse them
 (Of sin): they shall have
 A grievous Penalty.

78. There is among them
 A section who distort
 The Book with their tongues
 (As they read) you would think
 It is a part of the Book,
 But it is no part
 Of the Book; and they say,
 That is from God,"
 But it is not from God:
 It is they who tell
 A lie against God,
 And (well) they know it!

79. It is not (possible)
 That a man, to whom
 Is given the Book,
 And Wisdom,
 And the Prophetic Office,
 Should say to people:
 "Be ye my worshippers
 Rather than God's":
 On the contrary
 (He would say):
 "Be ye worshippers
 Of Him Who is truly
 The Cherisher of all:
 For ye have taught
 The Book and ye
 Have studied it earnestly."

80. Nor would he instruct you
 To take angels and prophets
 For Lords and Patrons.
 What! would he bid you

To unbelief after ye have
 Bowed your will
 (To God in Islam)?

  

SECTION 9.

81. Behold! God took
 The Covenant of the Prophets,
 Saying: "I give you
 A Book and Wisdom;
 Then comes to you
 An Apostle, confirming
 What is with you;
 Do ye believe in him
 And render him help."
 God said: "Do ye agree,
 And take this my Covenant
 As binding on you?"
 They said: "We agree."
 He said: "Then bear witness,
 And I am with you
 Among the witnesses."

82. If any turn back
 After this, they are
 Perverted transgressors.

83. Do they seek
 For other than the Religion
 Of God?--while all creatures
 In the heavens and on earth
 Have, willing or unwilling,
 Bowed to His Will
 (Accepted Islam),
 And to Him shall they
 All be brought back.

84. Say: "We believe
 In God, and in what
 Has been revealed to us
 And what was revealed
 To Abraham, Isma'il;
 Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes,
 And in (the Books)
 Given to Moses, Jesus,
 And the Prophets,
 From their Lord:
 We make no distinction
 Between one and another
 Among them, and to God do we
 Bow our will (in Islam)."

85. If anyone desires
 A religion other than
 Islam (submission to God),
 Never will it be accepted
 Of him; and in the Hereafter
 He will be in the ranks
 Of those who have lost
 (All spiritual good).

86. How shall God
 Guide those who reject
 Faith after they accepted it
 And bore witness
 That the Apostle was true
 And that Clear Signs
 Had come unto them?
 But God guides not
 A people unjust.

87. Of such the reward
 Is that on them (rests)

The curse of God,
 Of His angels,
 And of all mankind;--

88. In that will they dwell;
 Nor will their penalty
 Be lightened, nor respite
 Be their (lot);--

89. Except for those that repent
 (Even) after that,
 And make amends;
 For verily God
 Is Oft-Forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

90. But those who reject
 Faith after they accepted it,
 And then go on adding
 To their defiance of Faith,--
 Never will their repentance
 Be accepted; for they
 Are those who have
 (Of set purpose) gone astray.

91. As to those who reject
 Faith, and die rejecting,--
 Never would be accepted
 From any such as much
 Gold as the earth contains,
 Though they should offer it
 For ransom. For such
 Is (in store) a penalty grievous,
 And they will find no helpers.

  

SECTION 10.

92. By no means shall ye
 Attain righteousness unless
 Ye give (freely) of that
 Which ye love; and whatever
 Ye give, of a truth
 God knoweth it well.

93. All food was lawful
 To the Children of Israel,
 Except what Israel
 Made unlawful for itself,
 Before the Law (of Moses)
 Was revealed. Say:
 "Bring ye the Law
 And study it,
 If ye be men of truth."

94. If any, after this, invent
 A lie and attribute it
 To God, they are indeed
 Unjust wrong-doers.

95. Say: "God speaketh
 The Truth: follow
 The religion of Abraham,
 The sane in faith; he
 Was not of the Pagans."

96. The first House (of worship)
 Appointed for men
 Was that at Bakka:
 Full of blessing

And of guidance
 For all kinds of beings:

97. In it are Signs
 Manifest; (for example),
 The Station of Abraham;
 Whoever enters it
 Attains security;
 Pilgrimage thereto is a duty
 Men owe to God,
 Those who can afford
 The journey; but if any
 Deny faith, God stands not
 In need of any of His creatures.

98. Say: "O People of the Book!
 Why reject ye the Signs
 Of God, when God
 Is Himself witness
 To all ye do?"

99. Say: "O ye People of the Book!
 Why obstruct ye
 Those who believe,
 From the Path of God,
 Seeking to make it crooked,
 While ye were yourselves
 Witnesses (to God's Covenant)?'
 But God is not unmindful
 Of all that ye do."

100. O ye who believe!
 If ye listen
 To a faction
 Among the People of the Book,
 They would (indeed)
 Render you apostates
 After ye have believed!

101. And how would ye
 Deny Faith while unto you
 Are rehearsed the Signs
 Of God, and among you

Lives the Apostle?
 Whoever holds
 Firmly to God
 Will be shown
 A Way that is straight.

  

SECTION 11.

102. O ye who believe!
 Fear God as He should be
 Feared, and die not
 Except in a state
 Of Islam.

103. And hold fast,
 All together, by the Rope
 Which God (stretches out
 For you), and be not divided
 Among yourselves;
 And remember with gratitude
 God's favour on you;
 For ye were enemies
 And He joined your hearts
 In love, so that by His Grace,
 Ye became brethren;
 And ye were on the brink
 Of the Pit of Fire,
 And He saved you from it.
 Thus doth God make
 His Signs clear to you:
 That ye may be guided.

104. Let there arise out of you
 A band of people
 Inviting to all that is good,
 Enjoining what is right,

And forbidding what is wrong:
 They are the ones
 To attain felicity.

105. Be not like those
 Who are divided
 Amongst themselves
 And fall into disputations
 After receiving
 Clear Signs:
 For them
 Is a dreadful Penalty,--

106. On the Day when
 Some faces will be (lit up
 With) white, and some faces
 Will be (in the gloom of) black:
 To those whose faces
 Will be black, (will be said):
 "Did ye reject Faith
 After accepting it?
 Taste then the Penalty
 For rejecting Faith."

107. But those whose faces
 Will be (lit with) white,--
 They will be in (the light
 Of) God's mercy: therein
 To dwell (for ever).

108. These are the Signs
 Of God: We rehearse them
 To thee in Truth:
 And God means
 No injustice to any
 Of His creatures.

109. To God belongs all
 That is in the heavens

And on earth: to Him
 Do all questions
 Go back (for decision).

  

SECTION 12.

110. Ye are the best
 Of Peoples, evolved
 For mankind,
 Enjoining what is right,
 Forbidding what is wrong,
 And believing in God.
 If only the People of the Book
 Had faith, it were best
 For them: among them
 Are some who have faith,
 But most of them
 Are perverted transgressors.

111: They will do you no harm,
 Barring a trifling annoyance;
 If they come out to fight you,
 They will show you their backs,
 And no help shall they get.

112. Shame is pitched over them
 (Like a tent) wherever
 They are found,
 Except when under a covenant
 (Of protection) from God
 And from men; they draw
 On themselves wrath from God,
 And pitched over them
 Is (the tent of) destitution.
 This because they rejected
 The Signs of God, and slew
 The Prophets in defiance of right;

This because they rebelled
 And transgressed beyond bounds.

113. Not all of them are alike:
 Of the People of the Book
 Are a portion that stand
 (For the right); they rehearse
 The Signs of God all night long,
 And they prostrate themselves
 In adoration.

114. They believe in God
 And the Last Day;
 They enjoin what is right,
 And forbid what is wrong;
 And they hasten (in emulation)
 In (all) good works:
 They are in the ranks
 Of the righteous.

115. Of the good that they do,
 Nothing will be rejected
 Of them; for God knoweth well
 Those that do right.

116. Those who reject Faith,--
 Neither their possessions
 Nor their (numerous) progeny
 Will avail them aught against God:
 They will be Companions
 Of the Fire,--dwelling
 Therein (for ever).

117. What they spend
 In the life
 Of this (material) world
 May be likened to a Wind
 Which brings a nipping frost:
 It strikes and destroys the harvest
 Of men who have wronged

Their own souls: it is not God
 That hath wronged them, but
 They wrong themselves.

118. O ye who believe!
 Take not into your intimacy
 Those outside your ranks:
 They will not fail
 To corrupt you. They
 Only desire your ruin:
 Rank hatred has already
 Appeared from their mouths:
 What their hearts conceal
 Is far worse.
 We have made plain
 To you the Signs,
 If ye have wisdom.

119. Ah! ye are those
 Who love them,
 But they love you not,
 Though ye believe
 In the whole of the Book,
 When they meet you,
 They say, "We believe":
 But when they are alone,
 They bite off the very tips
 Of their fingers at you
 In their rage. Say:
 "Perish in your rage;
 God knoweth well
 All the secrets of the heart."

120. If aught that is good
 Befalls you, it grieves them;
 But if some misfortune
 Overtakes you, they rejoice

At it. But if ye are constant
 And do right,
 Not the least harm
 Will their cunning
 Do to you; for God
 Compasseth round about
 All that they do.

  

SECTION 13.

121. Remember that morning
 Thou didst leave
 Thy household (early)
 To post the Faithful
 At their stations for battle:
 And God heareth
 And knoweth all things:

122. Rememer two of your parties
 Meditated cowardice;
 But God was their protector,
 And in God should the Faithful
 (Ever) put their trust.

123. God had helped you
 At Badr, when ye were
 A contemptible little force;
 Then fear God; thus
 May ye show your gratitude.

124. Remember thou saidst
 To the Faithful: "Is it not enough
 For you that God should help you
 With three thousand angels
 (Specially) sent down?

125. "Yea,--if ye remain firm,
 And act aright, even if
 The enemy should rush here
 On you in hot haste,
 Your Lord would help you
 With five thousand angels
 Making a terrific onslaught."

126. God made it but a message
 Of hope for you, and an assurance
 To your hearts: (in any case)
 There is no help
 Except from God,
 The Exalted, the Wise:

127. That He might cut off
 A fringe of the Unbelievers
 Or expose them to infamy,
 And they should then
 Be turned back,
 Frustrated of their purpose.

128. Not for thee, (but for God),
 Is the decision:
 Whether He turn in mercy
 To them, or punish them;
 For they are indeed wrong-doers.

129. To God belongeth all
 That is in the heavens
 And on earth.
 He forgiveth whom He pleaseth
 And punisheth whom He pleaseth
 But God is Oft-Forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

  

SECTION 14.

130. ye who believe!
 Devour not Usury,
 Doubled and multiplied;
 But fear God; that
 Ye may (really) prosper.

131. Fear the Fire, which is prepared
 For those who reject Faith:

132. And obey God
 And the Apostle;
 That ye may obtain mercy.

133. Be quick in the race
 For forgiveness from your Lord,
 And for a Garden whose width
 Is that (of the whole)
 Of the heavens
 And of the earth,
 Prepared for the righteous,--

134. Those who spend (freely),
 Whether in prosperity,
 Or in adversity;
 Who restrain anger,
 And pardon (all) men;--
 For God loves those
 Who do good;--

135. And those who,
 Having done something
 To be ashamed of,
 Or wronged their own souls,
 Earnestly bring God to mind,
 And ask for forgiveness
 For their sins,
 And who can forgive
 Sins except God?--
 And are never obstinate
 In persisting knowingly
 In (the wrong) they have done

136. For such the reward
 Is forgiveness from their Lord,
 And Gardens with rivers
 Flowing underneath,--
 An eternal dwelling:
 How excellent a recompense
 For those who work (and strive)!

137. Many were the Ways of Life
 That have passed away
 Before you: travel through
 The earth, and see what was
 The end of those
 Who rejected Truth.

138. Here is a plain statement
 To men, a guidance
 And instruction to those
 Who fear God!

139. So lose not heart,
 Nor fall into despair:
 For ye must gain mastery
 If ye are true in Faith.

140. If a wound hath touched you,
 Be sure a similar wound
 Hath touched the others.
 Such days (of varying fortunes)
 We give to men and men
 By turns: that God may know
 Those that believe,
 And that He may take
 To Himself from your ranks
 Martyr-witnesses (to Truth).
 And God loveth not
 Those that do wrong.

141. God's object also is to purge
 Those that are true in Faith
 And to deprive of blessing
 Those that resist Faith.

142. Did ye think that ye
 Would enter Heaven
 Without God testing
 Those of you who fought hard
 (In His Cause) and
 Remained steadfast?

143. Ye did indeed
 Wish for Death
 Before ye met him:
 Now ye have seen him
 With your own eyes,
 (And ye flinch!)

  

SECTION 15.

144. Muhammad is no more
 Than an Apostle: many
 Were the Apostles that passed away
 Before him. If he died
 Or were slain, will ye then
 Turn back on your heels?
 If any did turn back
 On his heels, not the least
 Harm will he do to God;
 But God (on the other hand)
 Will swiftly reward those
 Who (serve him) with gratitude.

145. Nor can a soul die
 Except by God's leave,

The term being fixed
 As by writing. If any
 Do desire a reward
 In this life, We shall give it
 To him; and if any
 Do desire a reward
 In the Hereafter, We shall
 Give it to him.
 And swiftly shall We reward
 Those that (serve us with) gratitude.

146. How many of the Prophets
 Fought (in God's way),
 And with them (fought)
 Large bands of godly men?
 But they never lost heart
 If they met with disaster
 In God's way, nor did
 They weaken (in will)
 Nor give in. And God
 Loves those who are
 Firm and steadfast.

147. All that they said was:
 "Our Lord! forgive us
 Our sins and anything
 We may have done
 That transgressed our duty:
 Establish our feet firmly,
 And help us against
 Those that resist
 Faith."

148. And God gave them
 A reward in this world,
 And the excellent reward
 Of the Hereafter. For God
 Loveth those who do good.

  

SECTION 16.

149. O ye who believe!
 If ye obey the Unbelievers,
 They will drive you back
 On your heels, and ye
 Will turn back (from Faith)
 To your own loss.

150. Nay, God is your Protector,
 And He is the best of helpers.

151. Soon shall We cast terror
 Into the hearts of the Unbelievers
 For that they joined companions
 With God, for which He had sew
 No authority: their abode
 Will be the Fire: and evil
 Is the home of the wrong-doers!

152. God did indeed fulfil
 His promise to you
 When ye with His permission
 Were about to annihilate
 Your enemy,--until ye flinched
 And fell to disputing
 About the order,
 And disobeyed it
 After He brought you in sight
 (Of the Booty) which ye covet.
 Among you are some
 That hanker after this world
 And some that desire
 The Hereafter. Then did He

Divert you from your foes
 In order to test you.
 But He forgave you:
 For God is full of grace
 To those who believe.

153. Behold! ye were climbing up
 The high ground, without even
 Casting a side glance
 At any one, and the Apostle
 In your rear was calling you
 Back. There did God give you
 One distress after another
 By way of requital,
 To teach you not to grieve
 For (the booty) that had escaped you
 And for (the ill) that had befallen you.
 For God is well aware
 Of all that ye do.

154. After (the excitement)
 Of the distress, He sent down
 Calm on a band of you
 Overcome with slumber,
 While another band
 Was stirred to anxiety
 By their own feelings,
 Moved by wrong suspicions
 Of God--suspicions due
 To Ignorance. They said:
 "What affair is this of ours?"
 Say thou: "Indeed, this affair

Is wholly God's." They hide
 In their minds what they
 Dare not reveal to thee.
 They say (to themselves):
 "If we had had anything
 To do with this affair,
 We should not have been
 In the slaughter here."
 Say: "Even if you had remained
 In your homes, those
 For whom death was decreed
 Would certainly have gone forth
 To the place of their death";
 But (all this was)
 That God might test
 What is in your breasts
 And purge what is
 In your hearts.
 For God knoweth well
 The secrets of your hearts.

155. Those of you
 Who turned back
 On the day the two hosts
 Met,--it was Satan
 Who caused them to fail,
 Because of some (evil)
 They had done. But God
 Has blotted out (their fault):
 For God is Oft-forgiving,
 Most Forbearing.

  

SECTION 17.

156. O ye who believe!
 Be not like the Unbelievers,
 Who say of their brethren,
 When they are travelling
 Through the earth or engaged
 In fighting: "If they had stayed
 With us, they would not
 Have died, or been slain."

This that God may make it
 A cause of sighs and regrets
 In their hearts. It is God
 That gives Life and Death,
 And God sees well
 All that ye do.

157. And if ye are slain, or die,
 In the way of God,
 Forgiveness and mercy
 From God are far better
 Than all they could amass.

158. And if ye die, or are slain,
 Lo! it is-unto God
 That ye are brought together.

159. It is part of the Mercy
 Of God that thou dost deal
 Gently with them.
 Wert thou severe
 Or harsh-hearted,
 They would have broken away
 From about thee: so pass over
 (Their faults), and ask
 For (God's) forgiveness
 For them; and consult
 Them in affairs (of moment).
 Then, when thou hast
 Taken a decision,
 Put thy trust in God.

For God loves those
 Who put their trust (in Him).

160. If God helps you,
 Non can overcome you:
 If He forsakes you,
 Who is there, after that,
 That can help you?
 In God, then,
 Let Believers put their trust.

161. No prophet could (ever)
 Be false to his trust.
 If any person is so false,
 He shall, on the Day
 Of Judgment, restore
 What he misappropriated;
 Then shall every soul
 Receive its due,--
 Whatever it earned,--
 And none shall be
 Dealt with unjustly.

162. Is the man who follows
 The good pleasure of God
 Like the man who draws
 On himself the wrath
 Of God, and whose abode
 Is in Hell?--
 A woeful refuge!

163. They are in varying grades
 In the sight of God,
 And God sees well
 All that they do.

164. God did confer
 A great favour

On the Believers
 When He sent among them
 An Apostle from among
 Themselves, rehearsing
 Unto them the Signs
 Of God, sanctifying them,
 And instructing them
 In Scripture and Wisdom,
 While, before that,
 They had been
 In manifest error.

165. What! When a single
 Disaster smites you,
 Although ye smote (your enemies)
 With one twice as great,
 Do ye say?--
 "Whence is this?"
 Say (to them):
 "It is from yourselves:
 For God hath power
 Over all things."

166. What ye suffered
 On the day the two armies
 Met, was with the leave
 Of God, in order that
 He might test the Believers,--

167. And the Hypocrites also.
 These were told: "Come,
 Fight in the way of God,
 Or (at least) drive
 (The foe from Your city)."
 They said: "Had we known
 How to fight, we should
 Certainly have followed you."

They were that day
 Nearer to Unbelief
 Than to Faith,
 Saying with their lips
 What was not in their hearts.
 But God hath full knowledge
 Of all they conceal.

168. (They are) the ones that say,
 (Of their brethren slain),
 While they themselves
 Sit (at ease): "If only
 They had listened to us,
 They would not have been slain."
 Say: "Avert death
 From your own selves,
 If ye speak the truth."

169. Think not of those
 Who are slain in God's way
 As dead. Nay, they live,
 Finding their sustenance
 In the Presence of their Lord;

170. They rejoice in the Bounty
 Provided by God:
 And with regard to those
 Left behind, who have not
 Yet joined them (in their bliss),
 The (Martyrs) glory in the fact
 That on them is no fear,
 Nor have they (cause to) grieve.

171. They glory in the Grace
 And the Bounty from God,
 And in the fact that
 God suffereth not

The reward of the Faithful
 To be lost (in the least).

  

SECTION 18.

172. Of those who answered
 The call of God
 And the Apostle,
 Even after being wounded,
 Those who do right
 And refrain from wrong
 Have a great reward;--

173. Men said to them:
 "A great army is gathering
 Against you":
 And frightened them:
 But it (only) increased
 Their Faith: they said:
 "For us God sufficeth,
 And He is the best
 Disposer of affairs."

174. And they returned
 With Grace and Bounty
 From God: no harm
 Ever touched them:
 For they followed
 The good pleasure of God:
 And God is the Lord
 Of bounties unbounded.

175. It is only the Evil One
 That suggests to you
 The fear of his votaries:
 Be ye not afraid
 Of them, but fear Me,
 If ye have Faith.

176. Let not those grieve thee
 Who rush headlong
 Into Unbelief:
 Not the least harm
 Will they do to God:
 God's Plan is that He

Will give them no portion
 In the Hereafter,
 But a severe punishment.

177. Those who purchase
 Unbelief at the price
 Of faith,
 Not the least harm
 Will they do to God,
 But they will have
 A grievous punishment.

178. Let not the Unbelievers
 Think that Our respite
 To them is good for themselves:
 We grant them respite
 That they may grow
 In their iniquity:
 But they will have
 A shameful punishment.

179. God will not leave
 The Believers in the state
 In which ye are now,
 Until He separates
 What is evil
 From what is good.
 Nor will He disclose
 To you the secrets
 Of the Unseen,
 But He chooses
 Of His Apostles
 (For the purpose)
 Whom He pleases.
 So believe in God
 And His Apostles:
 And if ye believe
 And do right,
 Ye have a reward
 Without measure.

180. And let not those
 Who covetously withhold
 Of the gifts which God
 Hath given them of His Grace,
 Think that it is good for them:
 Nay, it will be the worse
 For them: soon shall the things
 Which they covetously withheld
 Be tied to their necks
 Like a twisted collar,
 On the Day of Judgment.
 To God belongs the heritage
 Of the heavens and the earth;
 And God is well-acquainted
 With all that ye do.

  

SECTION 19.

181. God hath heard
 The taunt of those
 Who say: "Truly, God
 Is indigent and we
 Are rich!"--We shall
 Certainly record their word

And (their act) of slaying
 The Prophets in defiance
 Of right, and We shall say:
 "Taste ye the Penalty
 Of the Scorching Fire!

182. "This is because
 Of the (unrighteous deeds)
 Which your hands
 Sent on before ye:
 For God never harms
 Those who serve Him."

183. They (also) said: "God took
 Our promise not to believe
 In an apostle unless
 He showed us a sacrifice
 Consumed by fire
 (From heaven)." Say:
 "There came to you
 Apostles before me,
 With Clear Signs
 And even with what
 Ye ask for: why then
 Did ye slay them,
 If ye speak the truth?"

184. Then if they reject thee,
 So were rejected apostles
 Before thee, who came
 With Clear Signs,
 Books of dark prophecies,
 And the Book of Enlightenment.

185. Every soul shall have
 A taste of death:
 And only on the Day
 Of Judgment shall you
 Be paid your full recompense.
 Only he who is saved
 Far from the Fire
 And admitted to the Garden
 Will have attained
 The object (of Life):
 For the life of this world
 Is but goods and chattels
 Of deception.

186. Ye shall certainly
 Be tried and tested
 In your possessions
 And in your personal selves;
 And ye shall certainly
 Hear much that will grieve you,
 From those who received
 The Book before yot:
 And from those who
 Worship many gods.
 But if ye persevere
 Patiently, and guard
 Against evil,--then
 That will be
 A determining factor
 In all affairs.

187. And remember
 God took a Covenant
 From the People of the Book,
 To make it known
 And clear to mankind,
 And not to hide it;

But they threw it away
 Behind their backs,
 And purchased with it
 Some miserable gain!
 And vile was the bargain
 They made!

188. Think not that those
 Who exult in what they
 Have brought about, and love
 To be praised for what
 They have not done,--
 Think not that they
 Can escape the Penalty.
 For them is a Penalty
 Grievous indeed.

189. To God belongeth
 The dominion
 Of the heavens
 And the earth;
 And God hath power
 Over all things.

  

SECTION 20.

190. Behold! In the creation
 Of the heavens and the earth,
 And the alternation
 Of Night and Day,--
 There are indeed Signs
 For men of understanding,--

191. Men who celebrate
 The praises of God,
 Standing, sitting,
 And lying down on their sides,
 And contemplate
 The (wonders of) creation

In the heavens and the earth,
 (With the thought):
 "Our Lord! not for naught
 Hast Thou created (all) this!
 Glory to Thee! Give us
 Salvation from the Penalty
 Of the Fire.

192. "Our Lord! any whom Thou
 Dost admit to the Fire,
 Truly Thou coverest with shame,
 And never will wrong-doers
 Find any helpers!

193. "Our Lord! we have heard
 The call of one calling
 (Us) to Faith, 'Believe ye
 In the Lord,' and we
 Have believed. Our Lord!
 Forgive us our sins,
 Blot out from us
 Our iniquities, and take
 To Thyself our souls
 In the company of the righteous.

194. "Our Lord! Grant us
 What Thou didst promise
 Unto us through Thine Apostles,
 And save us from shame
 On the Day of Judgment:
 For Thou never breakest
 Thy promise."

195. And their Lord hath accepted
 Of them, and answered them:
 "Never will I suffer to be lost
 The work of any of you,

Be he male or female:
 Ye are members, one of another:
 Those who have left their homes,
 Or been driven out therefrom,
 Or suffered harm in My Cause,
 Or fought or been slain,--
 Verily, I will blot out
 From them their iniquities,
 And admit them into Gardens
 With rivers flowing beneath;--
 A reward from the Presence
 Of God, and from His Presence
 Is the best of rewards."

196. Let not the strutting about
 Of the Unbelievers
 Through the land
 Deceive thee:

197. Little is it for enjoyment:
 Their ultimate abode
 Is Hell: what an evil bed
 (To lie on)!

198. On the other hand, for those
 Who fear their Lord,
 Are Gardens, with rivers
 Flowing beneath; therein
 Are they to dwell (for ever),--
 A gift from the Presence
 Of God; and that which is
 In the Presence of God
 Is the best (bliss)
 For the righteous.

199. And there are, certainly,
 Among the People of the Book,

Those who believe in God,
 In the revelation to you,
 And in the revelation to them,
 Bowing in humility to God:
 They will not sell
 The Signs of God
 For a miserable gain!
 For them is a reward
 With their Lord,
 And God is swift in account.

200. O ye who believe!
 Persevere in patience
 And constancy; vie
 In such perseverance;
 Strengthen each other;
 And fear God;
 That ye may prosper.



  

Sura IV.

  

Nisaa, or The Women.


1. O mankind! reverence
 Your Guardian-Lord,
 Who created you
 From a single Person,
 Created, of like nature,
 His mate, and from them twain
 Scattered (like seeds)
 Countless men and women;--
 Reverence God, through Whom
 Ye demand your mutual (rights),
 And (reverence) the wombs
 (That bore you): for God
 Ever watches over you.

2. To orphans restore their property
 (When they reach their age),
 Nor substitute (your) worthless things
 For (their) good ones; and devour not
 Their substance (by mixing it up)

With your own. For this is
 I ndeed a great sin.

3. If ye fear that ye shall not
 Be able to deal justly
 With the orphans,
 Marry women of your choice,
 Two, or three, or four;
 But if ye fear that ye shall not
 Be able to deal justly (with them),
 Then only one, or (a captive)
 That your right hands possess.
 That will be more suitable,
 To prevent you
 From doing injustice.

4. And give the women
 (On marriage) their dower
 As a free gift; but if they,
 Of their own good pleasure,
 Remit any part of it to you,
 Take it and enjoy it
 With right good cheer.

5. To those weak of understanding
 Make not over your property,
 Which God hath made
 A means of support for you,
 But feed and clothe them
 Therewith, and speak to them
 Words of kindness and justice.

6. Make trial of orphans
 Until they reach the age
 Of marriage; if then ye find
 Sound judgment in them,
 Release their property to them;
 But consume it not wastefully,
 Nor in haste against their growing up.
 If the guardian is well-off,
 Let him claim no remuneration,
 But if he is poor, let him
 Have for himself what is
 Just and reasonable.
 When ye release their property
 To them, take witnesses
 In their presence:
 But all-sufficient
 Is God in taking account.

7. From what is left by parents
 And those nearest relateds,
 There is a share for men
 And a share for women,
 Whether the property be small
 Or large,--a determinate share.

8. But if at the time of division
 Other relatives, or orphans,
 Or poor, are present,
 Feed them out of the (property),
 And speak to them
 Words of kindness and justice.

9. Let those (disposing of an estate)
 Have the same fear in their minds
 As they would have for their own
 If they had left a helpless family behind:
 Let them fear God, and speak
 Words of appropriate (comfort),

10. Those who unjustly
 Eat up the property
 Of orphans, eat up
 A Fire into their own
 Bodies: they will soon
 Be enduring a blazing Fire!

  

SECTION 2.

11. God (thus) directs you
 As regards your children's
 (Inheritance): to the male,
 A portion equal to that
 Of two females: if only
 Daughters, two or more,
 Their share is two-thirds
 Of the inheritance;
 If only one, her share
 Is a half.

For parents, a sixth share
 Of the inheritance to each,
 If the deceased left children;
 If no children, and the parents
 Are the (only) heirs, the mother
 Has a third; if the deceased
 Left brothers (or sisters)
 The mother has a sixth.
 (The distribution in all cases
 Is) after the payment
 Of legacies and debts.
 Ye know not whether
 Your parents or your children
 Are nearest to you
 In benefit. These are
 Settled portions ordained

By God; and God is
 All-knowing, All-wise.

12. In what your wives leave,
 Your share is a half,
 1f they leave no child;
 But if they leave a child,
 Ye get a fourth; after payment
 Of legacies and debts.
 In what ye leave,
 Their share is a fourth,
 If ye leave no child;
 But if ye leave a child,
 They get an eighth; after payment
 Of legacies and debts.

If the man or woman
 Whose inheritance is in question,
 Has left neither ascendants nor descendants,
 But has left a brother
 Or a sister, each one of the two
 Gets a sixth; but if more
 Than two, they share in a third;
 After payment of legacies
 And debts; so that no loss
 Is caused (to any one).
 Thus is it ordained by God;
 And God is All-knowing,
 Most Forbearing.

13. Those are limits
 Set by God: those who
 Obey God and His Apostle
 Will be admitted to Gardens
 With rivers flowing beneath,
 To abide therein (for ever)
 And that will be
 The Supreme achievement.

14. But those who disobey
 God and His Apostle
 And transgress His limits
 Will be admitted
 To a Fire, to abide therein:
 And they shall have
 A humiliating punishment.

  

SECTION 3.

15. If any of your women
 Are guilty of lewdness,
 Take the evidence of four
 (Reliable) witnesses from amongst you
 Against them; and if they testify,
 Confine them to houses until
 Death do claim them,

Or God ordain for them
 Some (other) way.

16. If two men among you
 Are guilty of lewdness,
 Punish them both.
 If they repent and amend,
 Leave them alone; for God
 Is Oft-returning, Most Merciful.

17. God accepts the repentance
 Of those who do evil
 In ignorance and repent
 Soon afterwards; to them
 Will God turn in mercy:
 For God is full of knowledge
 And wisdom.

18. Of no effect is the repentance
 Of those who continue
 To do evil, until Death
 Faces one of them, and he says,
 "Now have I repented indeed;"
 Nor of those who die
 Rejecting Faith: for them
 Have we prepared
 A punishment most grievous.

19. O ye who believe!
 Ye are forbidden to inherit
 Women against their will.
 Nor should ye treat them

With harshness, that ye may
 Take away part of the dower
 Ye have given them,--except
 Where they have been guilty
 Of open lewdness;
 On the contrary live with them
 On a footing of kindness and equity.
 If ye take a dislike to them
 It may be that ye dislike
 A thing, and God brings about
 Through it a great deal of good.

20. But if ye decide to take
 One wife in place of another,
 Even if ye had given the latter
 A whole treasure for dower,
 Take not the least bit of it back:
 Would ye take it by slander
 And a manifest wrong?

21. And how could ye take it
 When ye have gone in
 Unto each other, and they have
 Taken from you a solemn covenant?

22. And marry not women
 Whom your fathers married,--
 Except what is past:
 It was shameful and odious,--
 An abominable custom indeed.

  

SECTION 4.

23. Prohibited to you
 (For marriage) are:--
 Your mothers, daughters,
 Sisters; father's sisters,
 Mother's sisters; brother's daughters,
 Sister's daugters; foster-mothers
 (Who gave you suck), foster-sisters;
 Your wives' mothers;
 Your step-daughters under your
 Guardianship, born of your wives
 To whom ye have gone in,
 No prohibition if ye have not gone in;--
 (Those who have been)
 Wives of your sons proceeding
 From your loins;
 And two sisters in wedlock
 At one and the same time,
 Except for what is past;
 For God is Oft-forgiving,
 Most Merciful;--

24. Also (prohibited are)
 Women already married,
 Except those
 Whom your right hands possess:
 Thus hath God ordained
 (Prohibitions) against you:
 Except for these, all others
 Are lawful, provided
 Ye seek (them in marriage)
 With gifts from your property,--
 Desiring chastity, not lust.
 Seeing that ye derive
 Benefit from them, give them
 Their dowers (at least)
 As prescribed; but if,
 After a dower is prescribed, ye agree
 Mutually (to vary it),
 There is no blame on you,
 And God is All-knowing
 All-wise.

25. If any of you have not
 The means wherewith
 To wed free believing women,
 They may wed believing
 Girls from among those
 Whom your right hands possess:
 God hath full knowledge
 About your Faith.
 Ye are one from another:
 Wed them with the leave
 Of their owners, and give them
 Their dowers, according to what

Is reasonable: they should be
 Chaste, not lustful, nor taking
 Paramours: when they
 Are taken in wedlock,
 If they fall into shame,
 Their punishment is half
 That for free women.
 This (permission) is for those
 Among you who fear sin;
 But it is better for you
 That ye practise self-restraint.
 And God is Oft-forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

  

SECTION 5.

26. God doth wish
 To make clear to you
 And to show you
 The ordinances of those
 Before you; and (He
 Doth wish to) turn to you
 (In Mercy): and God
 Is All-knowing, All-wise.

27. God doth wish
 To turn to you,
 But the wish of those
 Who follow their lusts
 Is that ye should turn
 Away (from Him),
 Far, far away.

28. God doth wish
 To lighten your (difficulties);
 For man was created
 Weak (in flesh).

29. O ye who believe! sot
 Eat not up your property

Among yourselves in vanities:
 But let there be amongst you
 Traffic and trade
 By mutual good-will:
 Nor kill (or destroy)
 Yourselves: for verily
 God hath been to you
 Most Merciful!

30. If any do that
 In rancour and injustice,--
 Soon shall We cast them
 Into the Fire: and easy
 It is for God.

31. If ye (but) eschew
 The most heinous
 Of the things
 Which ye are forbidden to do,
 We shall expel
 Out of you
 All the evil in you,
 And admit you to a Gate
 Of great honour.

32. And in no wise covet
 Those things in which God
 Hath bestowed His gifts
 More freely on some of you
 Than on others: to men
 Is allotted what they earn,
 And to women what they earn:
 But ask God of His bounty.
 For God hath full knowledge
 Of all things.

33. To (benefit) every one,
 We have appointed
 Sharers and heirs
 To property left

By parents and relatives.
 To those, also, to whom
 Your right hand was pledged,
 Give their due portion.
 For truly God is witness
 To all things.

  

SECTION 6.

34. Men are the protectors
 And maintainers of women,
 Because God has given
 The one more (strength)
 Than the other, and because
 They support them
 From their means.
 Therefore the righteous women
 Are devoutly obedient, and guard
 In (the husband's) absence
 What God would have them guard.
 As to those women
 On whose part ye fear
 Disloyalty and ill-conduct,
 Admonish them (first),
 (Next), refuse to share their beds,
 (And last) beat them (lightly);
 But if they return to obedience,
 Seek not against them
 Means (of annoyance):

For God is Most High,
 Great (above you all).

35. If ye fear a breach
 Between them twain,
 Appoint (two) arbiters,
 One from his family,
 And the other from hers;
 If they wish for peace,
 God will cause
 Their reconciliation:
 For God hath full knowledge,
 And is acquainted
 With all things.

36. serve God, and join not
 Any partners with Him;
 And do good
 To parents, kinsfolk,
 Orphans, those in need,
 Neighbours who are near,
 Neighbours who are strangers,
 The Companion by your side,
 The way-farer (ye meet),
 And what your right hands possess:
 For God loveth not
 The arrogant, the vainglorious;--

37. (Nor) those who are niggardly
 Or enjoin niggardliness on others,
 Or hide the bounties
 Which God hath bestowed
 On them; for We have prepared,
 For those who resist Faith,
 A Punishment that steeps
 Them in contempt;--

38. Not those who spend
 Of their substance, to be seen
 Of men, but have no faith
 In God and the Last Day:
 If any take the Evil One
 For their intimate,
 What a dreadful intimate he is!

39. And what burden
 Were it on them if they
 Had faith in God
 And in the Last Day,
 And they spent
 Out of what God hath
 Given them for sustenance?
 For God hath full
 Knowledge of them.

40. God is never unjust
 In the least degree:
 If there is any good (done),
 He doubleth it,
 And giveth from His own
 Presence a great reward.

41. How then if We brought
 From each People a witness,

And We brought thee
 As a witness against
 These People!

42. On that day
 Those who reject Faith
 And disobey the Apostle
 Will wish that the earth
 Were made one with them:
 But never will they hide
 A single fact from God!

  

SECTION 7.

43. O ye who believe!
 Approach not prayers
 With a mind befogged,
 Until ye can understand
 All that ye say,
 Nor in a state
 Of ceremonial impurity
 (Except when travelling on the road),
 Until after washing
 Your whole body.
 If ye are ill,
 Or on a journey,
 Or one of you cometh
 From offices of nature,

Or ye have been
 In contact with women,
 And ye find no water,
 Then take for yourselves
 Clean sand or earth,
 And rub therewith
 Your faces and hands.
 For God doth blot out sins
 And forgive again and again.

44. Hast thou not turned
 Thy vision to those
 Who were given a portion
 Of the Book? They traffic
 In error, and wish that ye
 Should lose the right path.

45. But God hath full knowledge
 Of your enemies:
 God is enough for a Protector,
 And God is enough for a Helper.

46. Of the Jews there are those
 Who displace words
 From their (right) places,
 And say: "We hear
 And we disobey";
 And "Hear what is not
 Heard"; and "Ra'ina";--
 With a twist of their tongues
 And a slander to Faith.
 If only they had said:
 "We hear and we obey;
 And "Do hear";

And "Do look at us":
 It would have been better
 For them, and more proper;
 But God hath cursed them
 For their Unbelief; and but few
 Of them will believe.

47. O ye People of the Book!
 Believe in what We
 Have (now) revealed, confirming
 What was (already) with you,
 Before We change the face and fame
 Of some (of you) beyond all recognition,
 And turn them hindwards,
 Or curse them as We cursed
 The Sabbath-breakers,
 For the decision of God
 Must be carried out.

48. God forgiveth not
 That partners should be set up
 With Him; but He forgiveth
 Anything else, to whom
 He pleaseth; to set up
 Partners with God
 Is to devise a sin
 Most heinous indeed.

49. Hast thou not turned
 Thy vision to those
 Who claim sanctity
 For themselves?

Nay--but God
 Doth sanctify
 Whom He pleaseth.
 But never will they
 Fail to receive justice
 In the least little thing.

50. Behold! how they invent
 A lie against God!
 But that by itself
 Is a manifest sin!

  

SECTION 8.

51. Hast thou not turned
 Thy vision to those
 Who were given a portion
 Of the Book? They believe
 In Sorcery and Evil,
 And say to the Unbelievers
 That they are better guided
 In the (right) way
 Than the Believers!

52. They are (men) whom
 God hath cursed:
 And those whom God
 Hath cursed, thou wilt find,
 Have no one to help.

53. Have they a share
 In dominion or power?
 Behold, they give not a farthing
 To their fellow-men?

54. Or do they envy mankind
 For what God hath given them
 Of his bounty? But We
 Had already given the people
 Of Abraham the Book
 And Wisdom, and conferred
 Upon them a great kingdom.

55. Some of them believed,
 And some of them averted
 Their faces from him: and enough
 Is Hell for a burning fire.

56. Those who reject
 Our Signs, We shall soon
 Cast into the Fire:
 As often as their skins
 Are roasted through,
 We shall change them
 For fresh skins,
 That they may taste
 The Penalty: for God
 Is Exalted in Power, Wise.

57. But those who believe
 And do deeds of righteousness,
 We shall soon admit to Gardens,
 With rivers flowing beneath,--
 Their eternal home:
 Therein shall they have
 Companions pure and holy: ye
 We shall admit them
 To shades, cool and ever deepening.

58. God doth command you
 To render back your Trusts
 To those to whom they are due;
 And when ye judge

Between man and man,
 That ye judge with justice:
 Verily how excellent
 Is the teaching which He giveth you!
 For God is He Who heareth
 And seeth all things.

59. O ye who believe!
 Obey God, and obey the Apostle,
 And those charged
 With authority among you.
 If ye differ in anything
 Among yourselves, refer it
 To God and His Apostle,
 If ye do believe in God
 And the Last Day:
 That is best, and most suitable
 For final determination.

  

SECTION 9.

60. Hast thou not turned
 Thy vision to those
 Who declare that they believe
 In the revelations
 That have come to thee
 And to those before thee?
 Their (real) wish is
 To resort together for judgment
 (In their disputes)
 To the Evil One,
 Though they were ordered
 To reject him.
 But Satan's wish
 Is to lead them astray
 Far away (from the Right).

61. When it is said to them:
 "Come to what God hath revealed,

And to the Apostle":
 Thou seest the Hypocrites avert
 Their faces from thee in disgust.

62. How then, when they are
 Seized by misfortune,
 Because of the deeds
 Which their hands have sent forth?
 Then they come to thee,
 Swearing by God:
 "We meant no more
 Than good-will and conciliation!"

63. Those men,--God knows
 What is in their hearts;
 So keep clear of them,ss:
 But admonish them,
 And speak to them a word
 To reach their very souls.

64. We sent not an Apostle,
 But to be obeyed, in accordance
 With the Will of God.
 If they had only,
 When they were unjust
 To themselves,
 Come unto thee
 And asked God's forgiveness,
 And the Apostle had asked
 Forgiveness for them,
 They would have found
 God indeed Oft-returning,
 Most Merciful.

65. But no, by thy Lord,
 They can have
 No (real) Faith,
 Until they make thee judge
 In all disputes between them,
 And find in their souls
 No resistance against
 Thy decisions, but accept
 Them with the fullest conviction.

66. If We had ordered them
 To sacrifice their lives
 Or to leave their homes,
 Very few of them
 Would have done it:
 But if they had done
 What they were (actually) told,
 It would have been best
 For them, and would have gone
 Farthest to strengthen their (faith);

67. And We should then have
 Given them from Our Presence
 A great reward;

68. And We should have
 Shown them the Straight Way.

69. All who obey God
 And the Apostle
 Are in the company
 Of those on whom
 Is the Grace of God,--
 Of the Prophets (who teach),
 The Sincere (lovers of Truth),
 The Witnesses (who testify),
 And the Righteous (who do good):
 Ah! what a beautiful Fellowship!

70. Such is the Bounty
 From God: and sufficient
 Is it that God knoweth all.

  

SECTION 10.

71. O ye who believe!
 Take your precautions,
 And either go forth in parties
 Or go forth all together.

72. There are certainly among you
 Men who would tarry behind:
 If a misfortune befalls you,
 They say: "God did favour us
 In that we were not
 Present among them."

73. But if good fortune comes to you
 From God, they would be sure
 To say--as if there had never been
 Ties of affection between you and them--

"Oh! I wish I had been with them;
 A fine thing should I then
 Have made of it!"

74. Let those fight
 In the cause of God
 Who sell the life of this world
 For the Hereafter.
 To him who fighteth
 In the cause of God,--
 Whether he is slain
 Or gets victory
 Soon shall We give him
 A reward of great (value).

75. And why should ye not
 Fight in the cause of God
 And of those who, being weak,
 Are ill-treated (and oppressed)?--
 Men, women, and children,
 Whose cry is: "Our Lord!
 Rescue us from this town,
 Whose people are oppressors;
 And raise for us from Thee
 One who will protect;
 And raise for us from Thee
 One who will help!"

76. Those who believe
 Fight in the cause of God,
 And those who reject Faith
 Fight in the cause of Evil:
 So fight ye against the
 Friends of Satan: feeble indeed
 Is the cunning of Satan.

  

SECTION 11.

77. Hast thou not turned
 Thy vision to those

Who were told to hold back
 Their hands (from fight)
 But establish regular prayers
 And spend in regular Charity?
 When (at length) the order
 For fighting was issued to them,
 Behold! a section of them
 Feared men as
 Or even more than
 They should have feared God:
 They said: "Our Lord!
 Why hast Thou ordered us
 To fight? Wouldst Thou not
 Grant us respite
 To our (natural) term,
 Near (enough)?" Say: "Short
 Is the enjoyment of this world:
 The Hereafter is the best
 For those who do right:
 Never will ye be
 Dealt with unjustly
 In the very least!

78. "Wherever ye are,
 Death will find you out,
 Even if ye are in towers
 Built up strong and high!"

If some good befalls them,
 They say, "This is from God";
 But if evil, they say,
 "This is from thee" (O Prophet).

Say: "All things are from God."
 But what hath come
 To these people,
 That they fail
 To understand
 A single fact?

79. Whatever good, (O man!)
 Happens to thee, is from God;
 But whatever evil happens
 To thee, is from thy (own) soul.
 And We have sent thee
 As an Apostle
 To (instruct) mankind.
 And enough is God
 For a witness.

80 He who obeys
 The Apostle, obeys God:
 But if any turn away,
 We have not sent thee
 To watch over
 Their (evil deeds).

81. They have "Obedience"
 On their lips; but
 When they leave thee,
 A section of them
 Meditate all night
 On things very different
 From what thou tellest them.
 But God records
 Their nightly (plots):
 So keep clear of them,
 And put thy trust in God,
 And enough is God

As a disposer of affairs.

82. Do they not consider
 The Qur-an (with care)?
 Had it been from other
 Than God, they would surely
 Have found therein
 Much discrepancy.

83. When there comes to them
 Some matter touching
 (Public) safety or fear,
 They divulge it.
 If they had only referred it
 To the Apostle, or to those
 Charged with authority
 Among them, the proper
 Investigators would have
 Tested it from them (direct).
 Were it not for the Grace
 And Mercy of God unto you,
 All but a few of you
 Would have fallen
 Into the clutches of Satan.

84. Then fight in God's cause--
 Thou art held responsible
 Only for thyself--
 And rouse the Believers.
 It may be that God
 Will restrain the fury

Of the Unbelievers;
 For God is the strongest
 In might and in punishment.

85. Whoever recommends
 And helps a good cause
 Becomes a partner therein:
 And whoever recommends
 And helps an evil cause,
 Shares in its burden:
 And God hath power
 Over all things.

86. When a (courteous) greeting
 Is offered you, meet it
 With a greeting still more
 Courteous, or (at least)
 Of equal courtesy.
 God takes careful account
 Of all things.

87. God! There is no god
 But He: of a surety
 He will gather you together
 Against the Day of Judgment,
 About which there is no doubt.
 And whose word can be
 Truer than God's?

  

SECTION 12.

88. Why should ye be
 Divided into two parties

About the Hypocrites?
 God hath upset them
 For their (evil) deeds.
 Would ye guide those
 Whom God hath thrown
 Out of the Way? For those
 Whom God hath thrown
 Out of the Way, never
 Shalt thou find the Way.

89. They but wish that ye
 Should reject Faith,
 As they do, and thus be
 On the same footing (as they):
 But take not friends
 From their ranks
 Until they flee
 In the way of God
 (From what is forbidden).
 But if they turn renegades,
 Seize them and slay them
 Wherever ye find them;
 And (in any case) take
 No friends or helpers
 From their ranks:--

90. Except those who join
 A group between whom
 And you there is a treaty

(Of peace), or those who approach
 You with hearts restraining
 Them from fighting you
 As well as fighting their own
 People. If God had pleased,
 He could have given them
 Power over you, and they
 Would have fought you:
 Therefore if they withdraw
 From you but fight you not,
 And (instead) send you
 (Guarantees of) peace, then God
 Hath opened no way
 For you (to war against them).

91. Others you will find
 That wish to gain
 Your confidence as well
 As that of their people:
 Every time they are sent back
 To temptation, they succumb
 Thereto: if they withdraw not
 From you nor give you (guarantees)
 Of peace besides
 Restraining their hands,
 Seize them and slay them
 Wherever ye get them:
 In their case
 We have provided you
 With a clear argument
 Against them.

  

SECTION 13.

92. Never should a Believer
 Kill a Believer; but
 (If it so happens) by mistake,
 (Compensation is due):
 If one (so) kills a Believer,
 It is ordained that he
 Should free a believing slave,
 And pay compensation
 To the deceased's family,
 Unless they remit it freely.
 If the deceased belonged
 To a people at war with you,
 And he was a Believer,
 The freeing of a believing slave
 (Is enough). If he belonged
 To a people with whom
 Ye have a treaty of mutual
 Alliance, compensation should
 Be paid to his family,
 And a believing slave be freed.
 For those who find this
 Beyond their means, (is prescribed)
 A fast for two months
 Running: by way of repentance
 To God: for God hath
 All knowledge and all wisdom.

93.1f a man kills a Believer
 Intentionally, his recompense
 Is Hell, to abide therein
 (For ever): and the wrath
 And the curse of God
 Are upon him, and
 A dreadful penalty
 Is prepared for him.

94. O ye who believe!
 When ye go abroad
 In the cause of God,
 Investigate carefully,
 And say not to any one
 Who offers you a salutation:
 "Thou art none of a Believer!"
 Coveting the perishable goods
 Of this life: with God
 Are profits and spoils abundant.
 Even thus were ye yourselves
 Before, till God conferred
 On you His favours: therefore
 Carefully investigate.
 For God is well aware
 Of all that ye do.

95. Not equal are those
 Believers who sit (at home)
 And receive no hurt,
 And those who strive
 And fight in the cause
 Of God with their goods
 And their persons.
 God hath granted
 A grade higher to those
 Who strive and fight

With their goods and persons
 Than to those who sit (at home).
 Unto all (in Faith)
 Hath God promised good:
 But those who strive and fight
 Hath He distinguished
 Above those who sit (at home)
 By a special reward,--

96. Ranks specially bestowed
 By Him. And Forgiveness
 And Mercy. For God is
 Oft forgiving, Most Merciful.

  

SECTION 14.

97. When angels take
 The souls of those
 Who die in sin
 Against their souls,
 They say: "In what (plight)
 Were ye?" They reply:
 "Weak and oppressed
 Were we in the earth."
 They say: "Was not
 The earth of God
 Spacious enough for you
 To move yourselves away
 (From evil)?" Such men
 Will find their abode
 In Hell,--What an evil
 Refuge!--

98. Except those who are
 (Really) weak and oppressed--
 Men, women, and children--
 Who have no means
 In their power, nor (a guide-post)
 To direct their way.

99. For these, there is hope
 That God will forgive:
 For God doth blot out (sins)
 And forgive again and again.

100. He who forsakes his home
 In the cause of God,
 Finds in the earth
 Many a refuge,
 Wide and spacious:
 Should he die
 As a refugee from home
 For God and His Apostle,
 His reward becomes due
 And sure with God:
 And God is Oft-forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

  

SECTION 15.

101. When ye travel
 Through the earth,
 There is no blame on you
 If ye shorten your prayers,
 For fear the Unbelievers
 May attack you:
 For the Unbelievers are
 Unto you open enemies.

102. When thou (O Apostle)
 Art with them, and standest
 To lead them in prayer,
 Let one party of them
 Stand up (in prayer) with thee,
 Taking their arms with them:
 When they finish
 Their prostrations, let them
 Take their position in the rear.
 And let the other party come up
 Which hath not yet prayed--
 And let them pray with thee,
 Taking all precautions,
 And bearing arms:
 The Unbelievers wish,
 If ye were negligent
 Of your arms and your baggage,
 To assault you in a single rush.
 But there is no blame on you
 If ye put away your arms
 Because of the inconvenience
 Of rain or because ye are ill;
 But take (every) precaution
 For yourselves. For the
 Unbelievers
 God hath prepared
 A humiliating punishment.

103. When ye pass
 (Congregational) prayers,
 Celebrate God's praises,
 Standing, sitting down,
 Or lying down on your sides;
 But when ye are free
 From danger, set up
 Regular Prayers:
 For such prayers
 Are enjoined on Believers
 At stated times.

104. And slacken not
 In following up the enemy:
 If ye are suffering hardships,
 They are suffering similar
 Hardships; but ye have
 Hope from God, while they
 Have none. And God
 Is full of knowledge and wisdom.

  

SECTION 16.

105. We have sent down
 To thee the Book in truth,
 That thou might test judge
 Between men, as guided
 By God: so be not (used)
 As an advocate by those
 Who betray their trust;

106. But seek the forgiveness
 Of God; for God is
 Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.

107. Contend not on behalf
 Of such as betray
 Their own souls;
 For God loveth not
 One given to perfidy
 And crime;

108. They may hide
 (Their crimes) from men,
 But they cannot hide
 (Them) from God, seeing that
 He is in their midst
 When they plot by night,
 In words that He cannot
 Approve: and God
 Doth compass round
 All that they do.

109. Ah! these are the sort
 Of men on whose behalf
 Ye may contend in this world;
 But who will contend with God
 On their behalf on the Day
 Of Judgment, or who
 Will carry their affairs through?

110. If any one does evil
 Or wrongs his own soul
 But afterwards seeks
 God's forgiveness, he will find
 God Oft-forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

111. And if any one earns
 Sin, he earns it against

His own soul: for God
 Is full of knowledge and wisdom.

112. But if any one earns
 A fault or a sin
 And throws it on to one
 That is innocent,
 He carries (on himself)
 (Both) a falsehood
 And a flagrant sin.

  

SECTION 17.

113. But for the Grace of God
 To thee and His Mercy,
 A party of them would
 Certainly have plotted
 To lead thee astray.
 But (in fact) they will only
 Lead their own souls astray,
 And to thee they can do
 No harm in the least.
 For God hath sent down
 To thee the Book and Wisdom
 And taught thee what thou
 Knewest not (before):
 And great is the Grace
 Of God unto thee.

114. In most of their secret talks
 There is no good: but if
 One exhorts to a deed
 Of charity or justice
 Or conciliation between men,
 (Secrecy is permissible):
 To him who does this,
 Seeking the good pleasure
 Of God, We shall soon give
 A reward of the highest (value).

115. If anyone contends with
 The Apostle even after
 Guidance has been plainly
 Conveyed to him, and follows
 A path other than that
 Becoming to men of Faith,
 We shall leave him
 In the path he has chosen,
 And land him in Hell,--
 What an evil refuge!

  

SECTION 18.

116. God forgiveth not
 (The sin of) joining other gods
 With Him; but He forgiveth
 Whom He pleaseth other sins
 Than this: one who joins
 Other gods with God,
 Hath strayed far, far away
 (From the Right).

117. (The Pagans), leaving Him,
 Call but upon female deities:
 They call but upon Satan
 The persistent rebel!

118. God did curse him,
 But he said: "I will take
 Of Thy servants a portion
 Marked off;

119. "I will mislead them,
 And I will create

In them false desires; I will
 Order them to slit the ears
 Of cattle, and to deface
 The (fair) nature created
 By God." Whoever,
 Forsaking God, takes Satan
 For a friend, hath
 Of a surety suffered
 A loss that is manifest.

120. Satan makes them promises,
 And creates in them false desires;
 But Satan's promises
 Are nothing but deception.

121. They (his dupes)
 Will have their dwelling
 In Hell, and from it
 They will find no way
 Of escape.

122. But those who believe
 And do deeds of righteousness,--
 We shall soon admit them
 To Gardens, with rivers
 Flowing beneath,--to dwell
 Therein for ever.
 God's promise is the truth,
 And whose word can be
 Truer than God's?

123. Not your desires, nor those
 Of the People of the Book

(Can prevail): whoever
 Works evil, will be
 Requited accordingly.
 Nor will he find, besides God,
 Any protector or helper.

124. If any do deeds
 Of righteousness,
 Be they male or female--
 And have faith,
 They will enter Heaven,
 And not the least injustice
 Will be done to them.

125. Who can be better
 In religion than one
 Who submits his whole self
 To God, does good,
 And follows the way
 Of Abraham the true in faith?
 For God did take
 Abraham for a friend.

126. But to God belong all things
 In the heavens and on earth:
 And He it is that
 Encompasseth all things.

  

SECTION 19.

127. They ask thy instruction
 Concerning the Women
 Say: God doth
 Instruct you about them:
 And (remember) what hath
 Been rehearsed unto you
 In the Book, concerning
 The orphans of women to whom
 Ye give not the portions
 Prescribed, and yet whom ye
 Desire to marry, as also
 Concerning the children
 Who are weak and oppressed:
 That ye stand firm
 For justice to orphans.
 There is not a good deed
 Which ye do, but God
 Is well-acquainted therewith.

128. If a wife fears
 Cruelty or desertion
 On her husband's part,
 There is no blame on them
 If they arrange
 An amicable settlement
 Between themselves;
 And such settlement is best;

Even though men's souls
 Are swayed by greed.
 But if ye do good
 And practise self-restraint,
 God is well-acquainted
 With all that ye do.

129. Ye are never able
 To be fair and just
 As between women,
 Even if it is
 Your ardent desire:
 But turn not away
 (From a woman) altogether,
 So as to leave her (as it were)
 Hanging (in the air).
 If ye come to a friendly
 Understanding, and practise
 Self-restraint, God is
 Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.

130. But if they disagree
 (And must part), God
 Will provide abundance
 For all from His
 All-reaching bounty:
 For God is He
 That careth for all
 And is Wise.

131. To God belong all things
 In the heavens and on earth.

Verily We have directed
 The People of the Book
 Before you, and you (O Muslims).
 To fear God. But if ye
 Deny Him, to! unto God
 Belong all things
 In the heavens and on earth,
 And God is free
 Of all wants, worthy
 Of all praise.

132. Yea, unto God belong
 All things in the heavens
 And on earth, and enough
 Is God to carry through
 All affairs.

133. If it were His Will,
 He could destroy you,
 O mankind, and create
 Another race; for He
 Hath power this to do.

134. If any one desires
 A reward in this life,
 In God's (gift) is the reward
 (Both) of this life
 And of the Hereafter:
 For God is He that heareth
 And seeth (all things).

  

SECTION 20.

135. O ye who believe!
 Stand out firmly
 For justice, as witnesses
 To God, even as against
 Yourselves, or your parents,
 Or your kin, and whether
 It be (against) rich or poor:
 For God can best protect both.
 Follow not the lusts
 (Of your hearts), lest ye
 Swerve, and if ye
 Distort (justice) or decline
 To do justice, verily
 God is well-acquainted
 With all that ye do.

136. O ye who believe!
 Believe in God
 And His Apostle,
 And the scripture which He
 Hath sent to His Apostle
 And the scripture which He sent
 To those before (him)
 Any who denieth God,
 His angels, His Books,
 His Apostles, and the Day
 Of Judgment, hath gone
 Far, far astray.

137. Those who believe,
 Then reject Faith,
 Then believe (again)
 And (again) reject Faith,
 And go on increasing
 In Unbelief,--God
 Will not forgive them
 Nor guide them on the Way.

138. To the Hypocrites give
 The glad tidings that
 There is for them
 (But) a grievous Penalty;--

139. Yea, to those who take
 For friends Unbelievers
 Rather than Believers:
 Is it honour they seek
 Among them? Nay,--
 All honour is with God.

140. Already has He sent you
 Word in the Book, that when
 Ye hear the Signs of God
 Held in defiance and ridicule,
 Ye are not to sit with them
 Unless they turn to a different
 Theme: if ye did, ye would be
 Like them. For God will
 Collect the Hypocrites and those
 Who defy Faith--all in Hell;--

141. (These are) the ones who
 Wait and watch about you:
 If ye do gain
 A victory from God,
 They say: "Were we not
 With you?"--but if
 The Unbelievers gain
 A success, they say
 (To them): "Did we not
 Gain an advantage over you,
 And did we not guard
 You from the Believers?"
 But God will judge
 Betwixt you on the Day
 Of Judgment. And never
 Will God grant
 To the Unbelievers
 A way (to Triumph)
 Over the Believers.

  

SECTION 21.

142. The Hypocrites--they think
 They are over-reaching God,
 But He will over-reach them:
 When they stand up to prayer,
 They stand without earnestness,
 To be seen of men,
 But little do they hold
 God in remembrance;

143. (They are) distracted in mind
 Even in the midst of it,--
 Being (sincerely) for neither
 One group nor for another.
 Whom God leaves straying,--
 Never wilt thou find

For him the Way.

144. O ye who believe!
 Take not for friends
 Unbelievers rather than
 Believers: do ye wish
 To offer God an open
 Proof against yourselves?

145. The Hypocrites will be
 In the lowest depths
 Of the Fire: no helper
 Wilt thou find for them;--

146. Except for those who repent,
 Mend (their life), hold fast
 To God, and purify their religion
 As in God's sight: if so
 They will be (numbered)
 With the Believers.
 And soon will God
 Grant to the Believers
 A reward of immense value.

147. What can God gain
 By your punishment,
 If ye are grateful
 And ye believe?
 Nay, it is God
 That recogniseth
 (All good), and knoweth
 All things.

148. God loveth not that evil
 Should be noised abroad
 In public speech, except
 Where injustice hath been
 Done; for God
 Is He who heareth
 And knoweth all things.

149. Whether ye publish
 A good deed or conceal it
 Or cover evil with pardon,
 Verily God doth blot out
 (Sins) and hath power
 (In the judgment of values),

150. Those who deny God
 And His apostles, and (those
 Who) wish to separate
 God from His apostles,
 Saying: "We believe in some
 But reject others":
 And (those who) wish
 To take a course midway,--

151. They are in truth
 (Equally) Unbelievers;

And We have prepared
 For Unbelievers a humiliating
 Punishment.

152. To those who believe
 In God and His apostles
 And make no distinction
 Between any of the apostles,
 We shall soon give
 Their (due) rewards:
 For God is Oft-forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

  

SECTION 22.

153. The People of the Book
 Ask thee to cause
 A book to descend to them
 From heaven: indeed
 They asked Moses
 For an even greater
 (Miracle), for they said:
 "Show us God in public,"
 But they were dazed
 For their presumption,
 With thunder and lightning.
 Yet they worshipped the calf
 Even after Clear Signs
 Had come to them;
 Even so We forgave them;
 And gave Moses manifest
 Proofs of authority.

154. And for their Covenant
 We raised over them
 (The towering height)
 Of Mount (Sinai);
 And (on another occasion)
 We said: "Enter the gate
 With humility"; and (once again)
 We commanded them:
 "Transgress not in the matter
 Of the Sabbath."
 And We took from them
 A solemn Covenant.

155. (They have incurred divine
 Displeasure): in that they
 Broke their Covenant;
 That they rejected the Signs
 Of God; that they slew
 The Messengers in defiance
 Of right; that they said,
 "Our hearts are the wrappings
 (Which preserve God's Word;
 We need no more)";--nay,
 God hath set the seal on their hearts
 For their blasphemy,
 And little is it they believe;--

156. That they rejected Faith;
 That they uttered against Mary

A grave false charge;

157. That they said (in boast),
 "We killed Christ Jesus
 The son of Mary,
 The Apostle of God";--
 But they killed him not,
 Nor crucified him,
 But so it was made
 To appear to them,
 And those who differ
 Therein are full of doubts,
 With no (certain) knowledge,
 But only conjecture to follow,
 For of a surety
 They killed him not:--

158. Nay, God raised him up
 Unto Himself; and God
 Is Exalted in Power, Wise;--

159. And there is none
 Of the People of the Book

But must believe in him
 Before his death;
 And on the Day of Judgment
 He will be a witness
 Against them;--

160. For the iniquity of the Jews
 We made unlawful for them
 Certain (foods) good and wholesome
 Which had been lawful for them;--
 In that they hindered many
 From God's Way;--

161. That they took usury,
 Though they were forbidden;
 And that they devoured
 Men's substance wrongfully;--
 We have prepared for those
 Among them who reject Faith
 A grievous punishment.

162. But those among them
 Who are well-grounded in knowledge,
 And the Believers,
 Believe in what hath been
 Revealed to thee and what was
 Revealed before thee:
 And (especially) those
 Who establish regular prayer
 And practise regular charity
 And believe in God
 And in the Last Day:
 To them shall We soon
 Give a great reward.

  

SECTION 23.

163. We have sent thee
 Inspiration, as We sent it
 To Noah and the Messengers
 After him: We sent
 Inspiration to Abraham,
 Ismail, Isaac, Jacob
 And the Tribes, to Jesus,
 Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon,
 And to David We gave
 The Psalms.

164. Of some apostles We have
 Already told thee the story;
 Of others we have not;--
 And to Moses God spoke direct;--

165. Apostles who gave good news
 As well as warning,
 That mankind, after (the coming)
 Of the apostles, should have
 No plea against God:
 For God is Exalted in Power,
 Wise.

166. But God beareth witness
 That what He hath sent
 Unto thee He hath sent
 From His (own) knowledge,

And the angels bear witness:
 But enough is God for a witness.

167. Those who reject Faith
 And keep off (men)
 From the Way of God,
 Have verily strayed far,
 Far away from the Path.

168. Those who reject Faith
 And do wrong,--God
 Will not forgive them
 Nor guide them
 To any way--

169. Except the way of Hell,
 To dwell therein for ever.
 And this to God is easy.

170. O mankind! the Apostle
 Hath come to you in truth
 From God: believe in him:
 It is best for you. But if
 Ye reject Faith, to God
 Belong all things in the heavens
 And on earth: and God
 Is All-knowing, All-wise.

171. O People of the Book!
 Commit no excesses
 In your religion: nor say
 Of God aught but the truth.

Christ Jesus the son of Mary
 Was (no more than)
 An apostle of God,
 And His Word,
 Which He bestowed on Mary,
 And a Spirit proceeding
 From Him: so believe
 In God and His apostles.
 Say not "Trinity": desist:
 It will be better for you:
 For God is One God:
 Glory be to Him:
 (Far Exalted is He) above
 Having a son, To Him
 Belong all things in the heavens
 And on earth. And enough
 Is God as a Disposer of affairs.

  

SECTION 24.

172. Christ disdaineth not
 To serve and worship God,
 Nor do the angels, those
 Nearest (to God):
 Those who disdain
 His worship and are arrogant,--
 He will gather them all
 Together unto Himself
 To (answer).

173. But to those who believe
 And do deeds of righteousness,
 He will give their (due)
 Rewards,--and more,
 Out of His bounty:
 But those who are
 Disdainful and arrogant,
 He will punish

With a grievous penalty;
 Nor will they find,
 Besides God, any
 To protect or help them.

174. O mankind! Verily
 There hath come to you
 A convincing proof
 From your Lord:
 For We have sent unto you
 A light (that is) manifest.

175. Then those who believe
 In God, and hold fast
 To Him,--soon will He
 Admit them to Mercy
 And Grace from Himself,
 And guide them to Himself
 By a straight Way.

176. They ask thee
 For a legal decision.
 Say: God directs (thus)
 About those who leave
 No descendants or ascendants
 As heirs. If it is a man
 That dies, leaving a sister
 But no child, she shall

Have half the inheritance:
 If (such a deceased was)
 A woman, who left no child,
 Her brother takes her inheritance:
 If there are two sisters,
 They shall have two-thirds
 Of the inheritance
 (Between them): if there are
 Brothers and sisters, (they share),
 The male having twice
 The share of the female.
 Thus doth God make clear
 To you (His law), lest
 Ye err. And God
 Hath knowledge of all things.



  

Sura V.

  

Maida, or The Table Spread.



1.  O ye who believe!
 Fulfil (all) obligations
  Lawful unto you (for food)
 Are all four-footed animals,
 With the exceptions named:
 But animals of the chase
 Are forbidden while ye
 Are in the Sacred Precincts
 Or in pilgrim garb:
 For God doth command
 According to His Will and Plan

2.  O ye who believe!
 Violate not the sanctity

Of the Symbols of God,
 Nor of the Sacred Month,
 Nor of the animals brought
 For sacrifice, nor the garlands
 That mark out such animals,
 Nor the people resorting
 To the Sacred House,
 Seeking of the bounty
 And good pleasure
 Of their Lord.
 But when ye are clear
 Of the Sacred Precincts
 And of pilgrim garb,
 Ye may hunt
 And let not the hatred
 Of some people
 In (once) shutting you out
 Of the Sacred Mosque
 Lead you to transgression
 (And hostility on your part).
 Help ye one another
 In righteousness and piety,
 But help ye not one another
 In sin and rancour:
 Fear God: for God
 Is strict in punishment.

3.  Forbidden to you (for food)
 Are: dead meat, blood,

The flesh of swine, and that
 On which hath been invoked
 The name of other than God;
 That which hath been
 Killed by strangling,
 Or by a violent blow,
 Or by a headlong fall,
 Or by being gored to death;
 That which hath been (partly)
 Eaten by a wild animal;
 Unless ye are able
 To slaughter it (in due form);
 That which is sacrificed
 On stone (altars);
 (Forbidden) also is the division
 (Of meat) by raffling
 With arrows: that is impiety.
 This day have those who
 Reject Faith given up
 All hope of your religion:
 Yet fear them not
 But fear Me.
 This day have I
 Perfected your religion
 For you, completed
 My favour upon you,
 And have chosen for you
 Islam as your religion.
 But if any is forced
 By hunger, with no inclination
 To transgression, God is
 Indeed Oft-forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

4.  They ask thee what is
 Lawful to them (as food)
 Say: Lawful unto you
 Are (all) things good and pure:
 And what ye have taught
 Your trained hunting animals
 (To catch) in the manner
 Directed to you by God:
 Eat what they catch for you,
 But pronounce the name
 Of God over it: and fear
 God; for God is swift
 In taking account.

5.  This day are (all) things
 Good and pure made lawful
 Unto you. The food
 Of the People of the Book
 Is lawful unto you
 And yours is lawful
 Unto them.
 (Lawful unto you in marriage)
 Are (not only) chaste women
 Who are believers, but
 Chaste women among
 The People of the Book,

Revealed before your time,--
 When ye give them
 Their due dowers, and desire
 Chastity, not lewdness,
 Nor secret intrigues.
 If any one rejects faith,
 Fruitless is his work,
 And in the Hereafter
 He will be in the ranks
 Of those who have lost
 (All spiritual good).

  

SECTION 2.

6.  O ye who believe!
 When ye prepare
 For prayer, wash
 Your faces, and your hands
 (And arms) to the elbows;
 Rub your heads (with water);
 And (wash) your feet
 To the ankles.
 If ye are in a state
 Of ceremonial impurity,
 Bathe your whole body.
 But if ye are ill,
 Or on a journey,
 Or one of you cometh
 From offices of nature,
 Or ye have been
 In contact with women,
 And ye find no water,
 Then take for yourselves
 Clean sand or earth,

And rub therewith
 Your faces and hands.
 God doth not wish
 To place you in a difficulty,
 But to make you clean,
 And to complete
 His favour to you,
 That ye may be grateful.

7.  And call in remembrance
 The favour of God
 Unto you, and His Covenant,
 Which He ratified
 With you, when ye said:
 "We hear and we obey":
 And fear God, for God
 Knoweth well
 The secrets of your hearts.

8.  O ye who believe!
 Stand out firmly
 For God, as witnesses
 To fair dealing, and let not
 The hatred of others
 To you make you swerve
 To wrong and depart from
 Justice. Be just: that is
 Next to Piety: and fear God.
 For God is well-acquainted
 With all that ye do.

9.  To those who believe
 And do deeds of righteousness
 Hath God promised forgiveness
 And a great reward.

10.  Those who reject faith
 And deny Our Signs
 Will be Companions
 Of Hell-fire.

11.  O ye who believe
 Call in remembrance
 The favour of God
 Unto you when
 Certain men formed the design
 To stretch out
 Their hands against you,
 But (God) held back
 Their hands from you:
 So fear God. And on God
 Let Believers put
 (All) their trust.

  

SECTION 3.

12.  God did aforetime
 Take a Covenant from
 The Children of Israel,
 And We appointed twelve
 Captains among them.
 And God said: "I am
 With you: if ye (but)
 Establish regular Prayers,

Practise regular Charity,
 Believe in My apostles,
 Honour and assist them,
 And loan to God
 A beautiful loan,
 Verily I will wipe out
 From you your evils,
 And admit you to Gardens
 With rivers flowing beneath;
 But if any of you, after this,
 Resisteth faith, he hath truly
 Wandered from the path
 Of rectitude."

13.  But because of their breach
 Of their Covenant, We
 Cursed them, and made
 Their hearts grow hard:
 They change the words
 From their (right) places
 And forget a good part
 Of the Message that was
 Sent them, nor wilt thou
 Cease to find them
 Barring a few--ever
 Bent on (new) deceits:
 But forgive them, and overlook
 (Their misdeeds): for God
 Loveth those who are kind.

14.  From those, too, who call
 Themselves Christians,

We did take a Covenant,
 But they forgot a good part
 Of the Message that was
 Sent them: so We estranged
 Them, with enmity and hatred
 Between the one and the other,
 To the Day of Judgment.
 And soon will God show
 Them what it is
 They have done.

15.  O People of the Book!
 There hath come to you
 Our Apostle, revealing
 To you much that ye
 Used to hide in the Book,
 And passing over much
 (That is now unnecessary):
  There hath come to you
 From God a (new) light
 And a perspicuous Book,--

16.  Wherewith God guideth all
 Who seek His good pleasure
 To ways of peace and safety,
 And leadeth them out
 Of darkness, by His Will,
 Unto the light,--guideth them
 To a Path that is Straight.

17.  In blasphemy indeed
 Are those that say
 That God is Christ
 The son of Mary.
 Say: "Who then
 Hath the least power

Against God, if His Will
 Were to destroy Christ
 The son of Mary, his mother,
 And all--every one
 That is on the earth?
 For to God belongeth
 The dominion of the heavens
 And the earth, and all
 That is between. He createth
 What He pleaseth. For God
 Hath power over all things."

18.  (Both) the Jews and the Christians
 Say: "We are sons
 Of God, and His beloved."
 Say: "Why then doth He
 Punish you for your sins?
 Nay, ye are but men,
 Of the men He hath created:
 He forgiveth whom He pleaseth,
 And He punisheth whom He pleaseth:
 And to God belongeth
 The dominion of the heavens
 And the earth, and all
 That is between:
 And unto Him
 Is the final goal (of all)"

19.  O People of the Book!
 Now hath come unto you,
 Making (things) clear unto you,
 Our Apostle, after the break

In (the series of) our apostles,
 Lest ye should say:
 "There came unto us
 No bringer of glad tidings
 And no warner (from evil)":
 But now hath come
 Unto you a bringer
 Of glad tidings
 And a warner (from evil).
 And God hath power
 Over all things.

  

SECTION 4.

20.  Remember Moses said
 To his people: "O my People!
 Call in remembrance the favour
 Of God unto you, when He
 Produced prophets among you,
 Made you kings, and gave
 You what He had not given
 To any other among the peoples.

21.  "O my people! enter
 The holy land which
 God hath assigned unto you,
 And turn not back
 Ignominiously, for then
 Will ye be overthrown,
 To your own ruin."

22.  They said: "O Moses!
 In this land are a people
 Of exceeding strength:
 Never shall we enter it
 Until they leave it:
 If (once) they leave,
 Then shall we enter."

23.  (But) among (their) God-fearing men
 Were two on whom
 God had bestowed His grace:
 They said: "Assault them
 At the (proper) Gate:
 When once ye are in,
 Victory will be yours;
  But on God put your trust
 If ye have faith."

24.  They said: "O Moses!
 While they remain there,
 Never shall we be able
 To enter, to the end of time.
 Go thou, and thy Lord,
 And fight ye two,
 While we sit here"
 (And watch)."

25.  He said: "O my Lord!
 I have power only

Over myself and my brother:
 So separate us from this
 Rebellious people!"

26.  God said: "Therefore
 Will the land be out
 Of their reach for forty years:
 In distraction will they
 Wander through the land:
 But sorrow thou not
 Over these rebellious people.

  

SECTION 5.

27.  Recite to them the truth
 Of the story of the two sons

Of Adam. Behold! they each
 Presented a sacrifice (to God):
 It was accepted from one,
 But not from the other.
 Said the latter: "Be sure
 I will slay thee." "Surely,"
 Said the former, "God
 Doth accept of the sacrifice
 Of those who are righteous.

28. "If thou dost stretch thy hand
 Against me, to slay me,
 It is not for me to stretch
 My hand against thee
 To slay thee: for I do fear
 God, the Cherisher of the Worlds.

29.  "For me, I intend to let
 Thee draw on thyself
 My sin as well as thine,
 For thou wilt be among
 The Companions of the Fire,
 And that is the reward
 Of those who do wrong."

30.  The (selfish) soul of the other
 Led him to the murder
 Of his brother: he murdered
 Him, and became (himself)
 One of the lost ones.

31.  Then God sent a raven,
 Who scratched the ground,

To show him how to hide
 The shame of his brother.
 "Woe is me!" said he;
 "Was I not even able
 To be as this raven,
 And to hide the shame
 Of my brother?" Then he became
 Full of regrets--

32.  On that account: We ordained
 For the Children of Israel
 That if any one slew
 A person--unless it be
 For murder or for spreading
 Mischief in the land--
 It would be as if
 He slew the whole people:
 And if any one saved a life,
 It would be as if he saved
 The life of the whole people.
 Then although there came
 To them Our Apostles
 With Clear Signs, yet,
 Even after that, many
 Of them continued to commit
 Excesses in the land.

33.  The punishment of those
 Who wage war against God
 And His Apostle, and strive
 With might and main
 For mischief through the land
 Is: execution, or crucifixion,

Or the cutting off of hands
 And feet from opposite sides,
 Or exile from the land:
 That is their disgrace
 In this world, and
 A heavy punishment is theirs
 In the Hereafter;

34.  Except for those who repent
 Before they fall
 Into your power:
 In that case, know
 That God is Oft-forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

  

SECTION 6.

35.  O ye who believe!
 Do your duty to God,
 Seek the means
 Of approach unto Him,
 And strive with might
 And main in His cause:
 That ye may presper.

36.  As to those who reject
 Faith,--if they had
 Everything on earth,
 And twice repeated,
 To give as ransom
 For the penalty of the Day
 Of Judgment, it would
 Never be accepted of them.
 Theirs would be
 A grievous Penalty.

37.  Their wish will be
 To get out of the Fire,
 But never will they
 Get out therefrom:

Their Penalty will be
 One that endures.

38.  As to the thief,
 Male or female,
 Cut off his or her hands:
 A punishment by way
 Of example, from God,
 For their crime:
 And God is Exalted in Power.

39.  But if the thief repent
 After his crime,
 And amend his conduct,
 God turneth to him
 In forgiveness; for God
 Is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.

40.  Knowest thou not
 That to God (alone)
 Belongeth the dominion
 Of the heavens and the earth?
 He punisheth whom He pleaseth,
 And He forgiveth whom He pleaseth:
 And God hath power
 Over all things.

41.  O Apostle! let not
 Those grieve thee, who race
 Each other into Unbelief:
 (Whether it be) among those
 Who say "We believe"
 With their lips but
 Whose hearts have no faith;

Or it be among the Jews,--
 Men who will listen
 To any lie,--will listen
 Even to others who have
 Never so much as come
 To thee. They change the words
 From their (right) times
 And places; they say,
 "If ye are given this,
 Take it, but if not,
 Beware!" If any one's trial
 Is intended by God, thou hast
 No authority in the least
 For him against God.
 For such--it is not
 God's will to purify
 Their hearts. For them
 There is disgrace
 In this world, and
 In the Hereafter
 A heavy punishment.

42.  (They are fond of) listening
 To falsehood, of devouring
 Anything forbidden.
 If they do come to thee,
 Either judge between them,
 Or decline to interfere.
 If thou decline, they cannot
 Hurt thee in the least.
 If thou judge, judge
 In equity between them.
 For God loveth those
 Who judge in equity.

43.  But why do they come
 To thee for decision,
 When they have (their own)
 Law before them?
 Therein is the (plain)
 Command of God; yet
 Even after that, they would
 Turn away. For they
 Are not (really)
 People of Faith.

  

SECTION 7.

44.  It was We who revealed
 The Law (to Moses): therein
 Was guidance and light.'
 By its standard have been judged
 The Jews, by the Prophets
 Who bowed (as in Islam)
 To God's Will, by the Rabbis
 And the Doctors of Law:

For to them was entrusted
 The protection of God's Book,
 And they were witnesses thereto:
 Therefore fear not men,
 But fear Me, and sell not
 My Signs for a miserable price.
 If any do fail to judge
 By (the light of) what God
 Hath revealed, they are
 (No better than) Unbelievers.

45.  We ordained therein for them:
 "Life for life, eye for eye,
 Nose for nose, ear for ear,
 Tooth for tooth, and wounds
 Equal for equal." But if
 Any one remits the retaliation
 Byway of charity, it is
 An act of atonement for himself.
 And if any fail to judge
 By (the light of) what God
 Hath revealed, they are
 (No better than) wrong-doers.

46.  And in their footsteps
 We sent Jesus the son

Of Mary, confirming
 The Law that had come
 Before him: We sent him
 The Gospel: therein
 Was guidance and light,
 And confirmation of the Law
 That had come before him:
 A guidance and an admonition
 To those who fear God.

47.  Let the People of the Gospel
 Judge by what God hath revealed
 Therein. If any do fail
 To judge by (the light of)
 What God hath revealed,
 They are (no better than)
 Those who rebel.

48.  To thee We sent the Scripture
 In truth, confirming
 The scripture that came
 Before it, and guarding it's
 In safety: so judge
 Between them by what
 God hath revealed,
 And follow not their vain
 Desires, diverging
 From the Truth that hath come
 To thee. To each among you
 Have We prescribed a Law
 And an Open Way.
 If God had so willed.
 He would have made you
 A single People, but (His

Plan is) to test you in what
 He hath given you: so strive
 As in a race in all virtues.
 The goal of you all is to God;
 It is He that will show you
 The truth of the matters
 In which ye dispute;

49.  And this (He commands):
 Judge thou between them
 By what God hath revealed,
 And follow not their vain
 Desires, but beware of them
 Lest they beguile thee
 From any of that (teaching)
 Which God hath sent down
 To thee. And if they turn
 Away, be assured that
 For some of their crimes
 It is God's purpose to punish
 Them. And truly most men
 Are rebellious.

50.  Do they then seek after
 A judgment of (the Days
 Of) Ignorance? But who,
 For a people whose faith
 Is assured, can give
 Better judgment than God?

  

SECTION 8.

51.  O ye who believe!
 Take not the Jews
 And the Christians
 For your friends and protectors:
 They are but friends and protectors)
 To each other. And he

Amongst you that turns to them
 (For friendship) is of them.
 Verily God guideth not
 A people unjust.

52.  Those in whose hearts
 Is a disease--thou seest
 How eagerly they run about
 Amongst them, saying:
 "We do fear lest a change
 Of fortune bring us disaster."
 Ah! perhaps God will give
 (Thee) victory, or a decision
 According to His Will.
 Then will they repent
 Of the thoughts which they secretly
 Harboured in their hearts.

53.  And those who believe
 Will say: "Are these
 The men who swore
 Their strongest oaths by God,
 That they were with you?"
 All that they do
 Will be in vain,
 And they will fall
 Into (nothing but) ruin.

54.  O ye who believe!
 If any from among you
 Turn back from his Faith,
 Soon will God produce
 A people whom He will love
 As they will love Him,--
 Lowly with the Believers,
 Mighty against the Rejecters,
 Fighting in the Way of God,
 And never afraid
 Of the reproaches

Of such as find fault.
 That is the Grace of God,
 Which He will bestow
 On whom He pleaseth.
 And God encompasseth all,
 And He knoweth all things.

55.  Your (real) friends are
 (No less than) God,
 His Apostle, and the (Fellowship
 Of) Believers,--those who
 Establish regular prayers
 And regular charity,
 And they bow
 Down humbly (in worship).

56.  As to those who turn
 (For friendship) to God,
 His Apostle, and the (Fellowship
 Of) Believers,--it is
 The Fellowship of God
 That must certainly triumph.

  

SECTION 9.

57.  O ye who believe!
 Take not for friends
 And protectors those
 Who take your religion
 For a mockery or sport,--
 Whether among those
 Who received the Scripture
 Before you, or among those

Who reject Faith;
 But fear ye God,
 If ye have Faith (indeed).

58.  When ye proclaim
 Your call to prayer,
 They take it (but)
 As mockery and sport;
 That is because they are
 A people without understanding.

59.  Say: "O People of the Book!
 Do ye disapprove of us
 For no other reason than
 That we believe in God,
 And the revelation
 That hath come to us
 And that which came
 Before (us), and (perhaps)
 That most of you
 Are rebellious and disobedient?

60.  Say: "Shall I point out
 To you something much worse
 Than this, (as judged)
 By the treatment it received
 From God? Those who
 Incurred the curse of God
 And His wrath, those of whom some
 He transformed into apes and swine,
 Those who worshipped Evil;--
 These are (many times) worse
 In rank, and far more astray
 From the even Path!"

61.  When they come to thee,
 They say: "We believe":

But in fact they enter
 With a mind against Faith,
 And they go out
 With the same.
 But God knoweth fully
 All that they hide.

62.  Many of them dost thou
 See, racing each other
 In sin and rancour,
 And their eating of things
 Forbidden. Evil indeed
 Are the things that they do.

63.  Why do not the Rabbis
 And the doctors of law forbid
 Them from their (habit
 Of) uttering sinful words
 And eating things forbidden?
 Evil indeed are their works.

64.  The Jews say: "God's hand
 Is tied up." Be their hands
 Tied up and be they accursed
 For the (blasphemy) they utter.
 Nay, both His hands
 Are widely outstretched:
 He giveth and spendeth
 (Of His bounty) as He pleaseth.
 But the revelation that
 Cometh to thee from God
 Increaseth in most of them
 Their obstinate rebellion
 And blasphemy. Amongst them
 We have placed enmity

And hatred till the Day
 Of Judgment. Every time
 They kindle the fire of war,
 God doth extinguish it;
 But they (ever) strive
 To do mischief on earth.
 And God loveth not
 Those who do mischief.

65.  If only the People of the Book
 Had believed and been righteous,
 We should indeed have
 Blotted out their iniquities
 And admitted them
 To Gardens of Bliss.

66.  If only they had stood fast
 By the Law, the Gospel,
 And all the revelation that was sent
 To them from their Lord,
 They would have enjoyed
 Happiness from every side.'
 There is from among them
 A party on the right course:
 But many of them
 Follow a course that is evil.

  

SECTION 10.

67.  O Apostle! proclaim
 The (Message) which hath been
 Sent to thee from thy Lord.
 If thou didst not, thou

Wouldst not have fulfilled
 And proclaimed His Mission.
 And God will defend thee
 From men (who mean mischief).
 For God guideth not
 Those who reject Faith.

68.  Say: "O People of the Book!
 Ye have no ground
 To stand upon unless
 Ye stand fast by the Law,
 The Gospel, and all the revelation
 That has come to you from
 Your Lord." It is the revelation
 That cometh to thee from
 Thy Lord, that increaseth in most
 Of them their obstinate
 Rebellion and blasphemy.
 But sorrow thou not
 Over (these) people without Faith.

69.  Those who believe (in the Qur-an),
 Those who follow the Jewish (scriptures),
 And the Sabians and the Christians,--
 Any who believe in God
 And the Last Day,
 And work righteousness,--
 On them shall be no fear,
 Nor shall they grieve.

70.  We took the Covenant
 Of the Children of Israel
 And sent them apostles.
 Every time there came
 To them an apostle
 With what they themselves
 Desired not--some
 (Of these) they called

Impostors, and some they
 (Go so far as to) slay.

71.  They thought there would be
 No trial (or punishment);
 So they became blind and deaf;
 Yet God (in mercy) turned
 To them; yet again many
 Of them became blind and deaf.
 But God sees well
 All that they do.

72.  They do blaspheme who say:
 "God is Christ the son
 Of Mary" But said Christ:
 "O Children of Israel!
 Worship God, my Lord
 And your Lord." Whoever
 Joins other gods with God,--
 God will forbid him
 The Garden, and the Fire
 Will be his abode. There will
 For the wrong-doers
 Be no one to help.

73.  They do blaspheme who say:
 God is one of three
 In a Trinity: for there is
 No god except One God.
 If they desist not
 From their word (of blasphemy),
 Verily a grievous penalty
 Will befall the blasphemers
 Among them.

74.  Why turn they not to God,
 And seek His forgiveness?
 For God is Oft-forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

75.  Christ the son of Mary
 Was no more than
 An Apostle; many were
 The apostles that passed away

Before him. His mother
 Was a woman of truth.
 They had both to eat
 Their (daily) food.
 See how God doth make
 His Signs clear to them;
 Yet see in what ways
 They are deluded
 Away from the truth!

76.  Say: "Will ye worship,
 Besides God, something
 Which hath no power either
 To harm or benefit you?
 But God,--He it is
 That heareth and knoweth
 All things."

77.  Say: "O People of the Book!
 Exceed not in your religion
 The bounds (of what is proper),
 Trespassing beyond the truth,
 Nor follow the vain desires
 Of people who went wrong
 In times gone by,--who misled
 Many, and strayed (themselves)
 From the even Way.

  

SECTION 11.

78.  Curses were pronounced
 On those among the Children
 Of Israel who rejected Faith,
 By the tongue of David
 And of Jesus the son of Mary:
 Because they disobeyed
 And persisted in Excesses.

79.  Nor did they (usually)
 Forbid one another
 The iniquities which they
 Committed: evil indeed
 Were the deeds which they did.

80.  Thou seest many of them
 Turning in friendship
 To the Unbelievers.
 Evil indeed are (the works) which
 Their souls have sent forward
 Before them (with the result),
 That God's wrath
 Is on them,
 And in torment
 Will they abide.

81.  If only they had believed
 In God, in the Apostle,
 And in what hath been
 Revealed to him, never
 Would they have taken
 Them for friends and protectors,
 But most of them are
 Rebellious wrong-doers.

82.  Strongest among men in enmity
 To the Believers wilt thou
 Find the Jews and Pagans;
 And nearest among them in love
 To the Believers wilt thou
 Find those who say,
 "We are Christians":
 Because amongst these are
 Men devoted to learning
 And men who have renounced
 The world, and they
 Are not arrogant.

83.  And when they listen
 To the revelation received
 By the Apostle, thou wilt
 See their eyes overflowing
 With tears, for they
 Recognise the truth:
 They pray: "Our Lord!
 We believe; write us
 Down among the witnesses.

84.  "What cause can we have
 Not to believe in God
 And the truth which has
 Come to us, seeing that
 We long for our Lord
 To admit us to the company
 Of the righteous?"

85.  And for this their prayer
 Hath God rewarded them
 With Gardens, with rivers
 Flowing underneath,--their eternal
 Home. Such is the recompense
 Of those who do good.

86.  But those who reject Faith
 And belie Our Signs,--
 They shall be Companions
 Of Hell-fire.

  

SECTION 12.

87.  O ye who believe!
 Make not unlawful

The good things which God
 Hath made lawful for you,
 But commit no excess:
 For God loveth not
 Those given to excess.

88.  Eat of the things which
 God hath provided for you,
 Lawful and good; but fear
 God, in Whom ye believe.

89.  God will not call you
 To account for what is
 Futile in your oaths,
 But He will call you
 To account for your deliberate
 Oaths: for expiation, feed
 Ten indigent persons,
 On a scale of the average
 For the food of your families;
 Or clothe them; or give
 A slave his freedom.
 If that is beyond your means,
 Fast for three days.
 That is the expiation
 For the oaths ye have sworn.
 But keep to your oaths.
 Thus doth God make clear
 To you His Signs, that ye
 May be grateful.

90.  O ye who believe!
 Intoxicants and gambling,

(Dedication of) stones,
 And (divination by) arrows,
 Are an abomination,--
 Of Satan's handiwork:
 Eschew such (abomination),
 That ye may prosper.

91.  Satan's plan is (but)
 To excite enmity and hatred
 Between you, with intoxicants
 And gambling, and hinder you
 From the remembrance
 Of God, and from prayer:
 Will ye not then abstain?

92.  Obey God, and obey the Apostle,
 And beware (of evil):
 If ye do turn back,
 Know ye that it is
 Our Apostle's duty
 To proclaim (the Message)
 In the clearest manner.

93.  On those who believe
 And do deeds of righteousness
 There is no blame
 For what they ate (in the past),
 When they guard themselves
 From evil, and believe,
 And do deeds of righteousness,--
 (Or) again, guard themselves
 From evil and believe,--
 (Or) again, guard themselves
 From evil and do good.

For God loveth those
 Who do good.

  

SECTION 13.

94.  O ye who believe!
 God doth but make a trial of you
 In a little matter
 Of game well within reach
 Of your hands and your lances,
 That He may test
 Who feareth Him unseen:
 Any who transgress
 Thereafter, will have
 A grievous penalty.

95.  O ye who believe!
 Kill not game
 While in the Sacred
 Precincts or in pilgrim garb.
 If any of you doth so
 Intentionally, the compensation
 Is an offering, brought
 To the Ka'ba, of a domestic animal
 Equivalent to the one he killed,

As adjudged by two just men
 Among you; or by way
 Of atonement, the feeding
 Of the indigent; or its
 Equivalent in fasts: that he
 May taste of the penalty
 Of his deed. God
 Forgives what is past:
 For repetition God will
 Exact from him the penalty.
 For God is Exalted,
 And Lord of Retribution.

96.  Lawful to you is the pursuit
 Of water-game and its use
 For food,--for the benefit
 Of yourselves and those who
 Travel; but forbidden
 Is the pursuit of land-game;--
 As long as ye are
 In the Sacred Precincts
 Or in pilgrim garb.
 And fear God, to Whom
 Ye shall be gathered back.

97.  God made the Ka'ba,
 The Sacred House, an asylum
 Of security for men, as
 Also the Sacred Months,
 The animals for offerings,
 And the garlands that mark them:
 That ye may know
 That God hath knowledge
 Of what is in the heavens
 And on earth and that God
 Is well acquainted
 With all things.

98.  Know ye that God
 Is strict in punishment

And that God is
 Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.

99.  The Apostle's duty is
 But to proclaim (the Message).
 But God knoweth all
 That ye reveal and ye conceal.

100.  Say: "Not equal are things
 That are bad and things
 That are good, even though
 The abundance of the bad
 May dazzle thee;
 So fear God, O ye
 That understand;
 That (so) ye may prosper."

  

SECTION 14.

101.  O ye who believe!
 Ask not questions
 About things which,
 If made plain to you,
 May cause you trouble.
 But if ye ask about things
 When the Qur-an is being
 Revealed, they will be
 Made plain to you,
 God will forgive those:
 For God is Oft-forgiving,
 Most Forbearing.

102.  Some people before you
 Did ask such questions,

And on that account
 Lost their faith.

103.  It was not God
 Who instituted (superstitions
 Like those of) a slit-ear
 She-camel, or a she-camel
 Let loose for free pasture,
 Or idol sacrifices for
 Twin-births in animals,
 Or stallion-camels
 Freed from work
 It is blasphemers
 Who Invent a lie
 Against God; but most
 Of them lack wisdom.

104.  When it is said to them:
 "Come to what God
 Hath revealed; come
 To the Apostle":
 They say: "Enough for us
 Are the ways we found
 Our fathers following."
 What! even though their fathers
 Were void of knowledge
 And guidance?

105.  O ye who believe!
 Guard your own souls:
 If ye follow (right) guidance,
 No hurt can come to you
 From those who stray.
 The goal of you all
 Is to God: it is He
 That will show you
 The truth of all
 That ye do.

106.  O ye who believe!
 When death approaches
 Any of you, (take) witnesses
 Among yourselves when making
 Bequests,--two just men
 Of your own (brotherhood)
 Or others from outside
 If ye are journeying
 Through the earth,
 And the chance of death
 Befalls you (thus).
 If ye doubt (their truth),
 Detain them both
 After prayer, and let them both
 Swear by God:
 "We wish not in this
 For any worldly gain,
 Even though the (beneficiary)
 Be our near relation:
 We shall hide not
 The evidence before God:
 If we do, then behold!
 The sin be upon us!"

107.  But if it gets known
 That these two were guilty
 Of the sin (of perjury),
 Let two others stand forth
 In their places,--nearest
 In kin from among those
 Who claim a lawful right:
 Let them swear by God:
 "We affirm that our witness
 Is truer than that
 Of those two, and that we
 Have not trespassed (beyond
 The truth): if we did,
 Behold! the wrong be
 Upon us!"

108.  That is most suitable:
 That they may give the evidence

In its true nature and shape,
 Or else they would fear
 That other oaths would be
 Taken after their oaths.
 Hut fear God, and listen
 (To His counsel): for God
 Guideth not a rebellious people:

  

SECTION 15.

109.  One day will God
 Gather the apostles together,
 And ask: "What was
 The response ye received
 (From men to your teaching)?"
 They will say: "We
 Have no knowledge: it is Thou
 Who knowest in full
 All that is hidden."

110.  When will God say:
 "O Jesus the son of Mary!
 Recount My favour"'
 To thee and to thy mother.
 Behold! I strengthened thee
 With the holy spirit,
 So that thou didst speak
 To the people in childhood
 And in maturity.
 Behold! I taught thee
 The Book and Wisdom,
 The Law and the Gospel.
 And behold! thou makest
 Out of clay, as it were,

The figure of a bird,
 By My leave,
 And thou breathest into it,
 And it becometh a bird
 By My leave,
 And thou healest those
 Born blind, and the lepers,
 By My leave.
 And behold! thou
 Bringest forth the dead
 By My leave ego
 And behold! I did
 Restrain the Children of Israel
 From (violence to) thee
 When thou didst show them
 The Clear Signs,
 And the unbelievers among them
 Said: 'This is nothing
 But evident magic.

111.  "And behold! I inspired
 The Disciples to have faith
 In Me and Mine Apostle:
 They said, 'We have faith,
 And do thou bear witness
 That we bow to God
 As Muslims'."

112.  Behold! the Disciples said:
 "O Jesus the son of Mary!
 Can thy Lord send down to us
 A Table set (with viands)

From heaven?" Said Jesus:
 "Fear God, if ye have faith."

113.  They said: "We only wish
 To eat thereof and satisfy
 Our hearts, and to know
 That thou hast indeed
 Told us the truth; and
 That we ourselves may be
 Witnesses to the miracle."

114.  Said Jesus the son of Mary:
 "O God our Lord!
 Send us from heaven
 A Table set (with viands),
 That there may be for us
 For the first and the last of us--
 A solemn festival
 And a. Sign from Thee;
 And provide for our sustenance,
 For Thou art the best
 Sustainer (of our needs)."

115.  God said: "I will
 Send it down unto you:
 But if any of you
 After that resisteth faith,
 I will punish him
 With a penalty such
 As I have not inflicted
 On any one among

All the peoples."

  

SECTION 16.

116.  And behold! God will say:
 "O Jesus the son of Mary!
 Didst thou say unto men,
 Worship me and my mother
 As gods in derogation of God'?"
 He will say: "Glory to Thee!
 Never could I say
 What I had no right
 (To say). Had I said
 Such a thing, Thou wouldst
 Indeed have known it.
 Thou knowest what is
 In my heart, though I
 Know not what is
 In Thine. For Thou
 Knowest in full
 All that is hidden.

117.  "Never said I to them
 Aught except what Thou
 Didst command me
 To say, to wit, 'Worship
 God, my Lord and your Lord';
 And I was a witness
 Over them whilst I dwelt
 Amongst them; when thou
 Didst take me up
 Thou wast the Watcher
 Over them, and Thou
 Art a witness to all things.

118.  "If Thou dost punish them,
 They are Thy servants:

If Thou dost forgive them,
 Thou art the Exalted in power,
 The Wise."

119.  God will say: "This is
 A day on which
 The truthful will profit
 From their truth: theirs
 Are Gardens, with rivers
 Flowing beneath,--their eternal
 Home: God well-pleased
 With them, and they with God:
 That is the great Salvation,
 (The fulfilment of all desires).

120.  To God doth belong the dominion
 Of the heavens and the earth,
 And all that is therein,
 And it is He who hath power
 Over all things.



  

Sura VI.

  

An'am, or Cattle.



1. Praise be to God,
 Who created the heavens
 And the earth,
 And made the Darkness
 And the Light.
 Yet those who reject Faith
 Hold (others) as equal.
 With their Guardian-Lord.

2. He it is Who created
 You from clay, and then
 Decreed a stated term
 (For you). And there is
 In His Presence another
 Determined term; yet
 Ye doubt within yourselves!

3. And He is God
 In the heavens
 And on earth.
 He knoweth what ye
 Hide, and what ye reveal,
 And He knoweth
 The (recompense) which
 Ye earn (by your deeds)

4. But never did a single
 One of the Signs
 Of their Lord reach them,
 But they turned
 Away therefrom.

5. And now they reject
 The truth when it reaches
 Them: but soon shall they
 Learn the reality of what
 They used to mock at.

6. See they not how many
 Of those before them
 We did destroy?--
 Generations We had established
 On the earth, in strength
 Such as We have not given
 To you--for whom
 We poured out rain
 From the skies in abundance,
 And gave (fertile) streams
 Flowing beneath their (feet):
 Yet for their sins
 We destroyed them,
 And raised in their wake
 Fresh generations
 (To succeed them).

7. If We had sent
 Unto thee a written
 (Message) on parchment,
 So that they could
 Touch it with their hands,
 The Unbelievers would
 Have been sure to say:
 "This is nothing but

Obvious magic!"

8. They say: "Why is not
 An angel sent down to him?"
 If We did send down
 An angel, the matter
 Would be settled at once,
 And no respite
 Would be granted them.

9. If We had made it
 An angel, We should
 Have sent him as a man,
 And We should certainly
 Have caused them confusion
 In a matter which they have
 Already covered with confusion.

10. Mocked were (many)
 Apostles before thee;
 But their scoffers
 Were hemmed in
 By the thing that they mocked.

  

SECTION 2.

11. Say: "Travel through the earth
 And see what was the end
 Of those who rejected Truth".

12. Say: "To whom I elongeth
 All that is in the heavens

And on earth?" Say:
 "To God. He hath inscribed
 For Himself (the rule of) Mercy.
 That He will gather you
 Together for the Day of Judgment,
 There is no doubt whatever.
 It is they who have lost
 Their own souls, that will
 Not believe.

13. To him belongeth all
 That dwelleth (or lurketh)
 In the Night and the Day.
 For He is the One
 Who heareth and knoweth
 All things."

14. Say: "Shall I take
 For my protector
 Any other than God,
 The Maker of the heavens
 And the earth?
 And He it is that
 Feedeth but is not fed."
 Say: "Nay! but I am
 Commanded to be the first
 Of those who bow
 To God (in Islam),
 And be not thou
 Of the company of those
 Who join gods with God."

15. Say: "I would, if I
 Disobeyed my Lord,
 Indeed have fear
 Of the Penalty
 Of a Mighty Day.

16. "On that day, if the Penalty
 Is averted from any,
 It is due to God's Mercy;
 And that would be (Salvation),
 The obvious fulfilment
 Of all desire.

17. "If God touch thee
 With affliction, none
 Can remove it but He;
 If He touch thee with happiness,
 He hath power over all things.

18. "He is the Irresistible, (watching)
 From above over His worshippers;
 And He is the Wise,
 Acquainted with all things."

19. Say: "What thing is most
 Weighty in evidence?"
 Say: "God is witness
 Between me and you;
 This Qur-an hath been
 Revealed to me by inspiration,
 That I may warn you
 And all whom it reaches.
 Can ye possibly bear witness
 That besides God there is
 Another God?" Say:
 "Nay! I cannot bear witness!"
 Say: But in truth
 He is the One God,

And I truly am innocent
 Of (your blasphemy of) joining
 Others with Him."

20. Those to whom
 We have given the Book
 Know this as they know
 Their own sons.
 Those who have lost
 Their own souls
 Refuse therefore to believe.

  

SECTION 3.

21. Who doth more wrong
 Than he who inventeth
 A lie against God
 Or rejecteth His Signs?
 But verily the wrong-doers
 Never shall prosper.

22. One day shall We gather
 Them all together: We
 Shall say to those
 Who ascribed partners (to Us):
 "Where are the partners
 Whom ye (invented
 And) talked about?"

23. There will then be (left)
 No subterfuge for them
 But to say: "By God
 Our Lord, we were not
 Those who joined gods
 With God."

24. Behold! how they lie
 Against their own souls!

But the (lie) which they
 Invented will leave themes:
 In the lurch.

25. Of them there are some
 Who (pretend to) listen to thee;
 But We have thrown
 Veils on their hearts,
 So they understand it not,
 And deafness in their ears;
 If they saw every one
 Of the Signs, not they
 Will believe in them;
 In so much that
 When they come to thee,
 They (but) dispute with thee;
 The Unbelievers say:
 "These are nothing
 But tales of the ancients."

26. Others they keep away from it,
 And themselves they keep away;
 But they only destroy
 Their own souls,
 And they perceive it not.

27. If thou couldst but see
 When they are confronted
 With the Fire!
 They will say:
 "Would that we were
 But sent back!
 Then would we not reject
 The Signs of our Lord,
 But would be amongst those
 Who believe!"

28. Yea, in their own (eyes)
 Will become manifest
 What before they concealed.
 But if they were returned,
 They would certainly relapse
 To the things they were forbidden,

For they are indeed liars.

29. And they (sometimes) say:
 "There is nothing except
 Our life on this earth,
 And never shall we be
 Raised up again."

30. If thou couldst but see
 When they are confronted
 With their Lord!
 He will say:
 "Is not this the truth?"
 They will say:
 "Yea, by our Lord!"
 He will say:
 "Taste ye then the Penalty,
 Because ye rejected Faith."

  

SECTION 4.

31. Lost indeed are they
 Who treat it as a falsehood
 That they must meet God,
 Until on a sudden
 The hour is on them,
 And they say: "Ah! woe
 Unto us that we took
 No thought of it";
 For they bear their burdens
 On their backs,

And evil indeed are
 The burdens that they bear?

32. What is the life of this world
 But play and amusement? ess
 But best is the Home
 In the Hereafter, for those
 Who are righteous.
 Will ye not then understand?

33. We know indeed the grief
 Which their words do cause thee:
 It is not thee they reject:
 It is the Signs of God,
 Which the wicked contemn.

34. Rejected were the Apostles
 Before thee: with patience
 And constancy they bore
 Their rejection and their wrongs,
 Until Our aid did reach
 Them: there is none
 That can alter the Words
 (And Decrees) of God.
 Already hast thou received
 Some account of those Apostles.

35. If their spurning is hard
 On thy mind, yet if
 Thou wert able to seek
 A tunnel in the ground
 Or a ladder to the skies
 And bring them a Sign,--
 (What good?). If it were
 God's Will, He could
 Gather them together
 Unto true guidance:

So be not thou
 Amongst those who are swayed
 By ignorance (and impatience)!

36. Those who listen (in truth),
 Be sure, will accept:
 As to the dead, God will
 Raise them up; then will they
 Be turned unto Him.

37. Whey say: "Why is not
 A Sign sent down
 To him from his Lord?"
 Say: "God hath certainly
 Power to send down a Sign:
 But most of them
 Understand not."

38. There is not an animal
 (That lives) on the earth,
 Nor a being that flies
 On its wings, but (forms
 Part of) communities like you.
 Nothing have we omitted
 From the Book, and they (all)
 Shall be gathered to their Lord
 In the end.

39. Those who reject our Signs
 Are deaf and dumb,--

In the midst of darkness
 Profound: whom God willeth,
 He leaveth to wander:
 Whom He willeth, He placeth
 On the Way that is Straight.

40. Say: "Think ye to yourselves,
 If there come upon you
 The Wrath of God,
 Or the Hour (that ye dread),
 Would ye then call upon
 Other than God?--
 (Reply) if ye are truthful!

41. "Nay,--On Him would ye
 Call, and if it be
 His Will, He would remove
 (The distress) which occasioned
 Your call upon Him,
 And ye would forget
 (The false gods) which ye
 Join with Him!"

  

SECTION 5.

42. Before thee We sent
 (Apostles) to many nations,
 And We afflicted the nations
 With suffering and adversity,
 That they might learn humility.

43. When the suffering reached
 Them from Us, why then
 Did they not learn humility?
 On the contrary their hearts
 Became hardened, and Satan
 Made their (sinful) acts
 Seem alluring to them.

44. But when they forgot
 The warning they had received,

We opened to them the gates
 Of all (good) things,
 Until, in the midst
 Of their enjoyment
 Of our gifts,
 On a sudden, We called
 Them to account, when lo!
 They were plunged in despair!

45. Of the wrong-doers the last
 Remnant was cut off.
 Praise be to God,
 The Cherisher of the Worlds.

46. Say:"Think ye, if God
 Took away your hearing
 And your sight, and sealed up
 Your hearts, who--a god
 Other than God--could
 Restore them to you?"
 See how We explain
 The Signs by various (symbols);
 Yet they turn aside.

47. Say:"Think ye, if
 The Punishment of God
 Comes to you,
 Whether suddenly or openly,
 Will any be destroyed
 Except those who do wrong?

48. We send the apostles
 Only to give good news

And to warn: so those
 Who believe and mend
 (Their lives),--upon them
 Shall be no fear,
 Nor shall they grieve.

49. But those who reject
 Our Signs,--them
 Shall punishment touch,
 For that they ceased not
 From transgressing.

50. Say:"I tell you not
 That with me
 Are the Treasures of God,
 Nor do I know
 What is hidden,
 Nor do I tell you I am
 An angel. I but follow
 What is revealed to me."
 Say:"Can the blind
 Be held equal to the seeing?"
 Will ye then consider not?

  

SECTION 6.

51. Give this warning to those
 In whose (hearts) is the fear
 That they will be brought
 (To Judgment) before their Lord:
 Except for Him
 They will have no protector
 Nor intercessor:
 That they may guard
 (Against evil).

52. Send not away those
 Who call on their Lord
 Morning and evening,
 Seeking His Face.
 In naught art thou accountable
 For them, and in naught are they
 Accountable for thee,
 That thou shouldst turn
 Them away, and thus be
 (One) of the unjust.

53. Thus did We try
 Some of them by comparison
 With others, that they
 Should say:"Is it these
 Then that God hath
 Favoured from amongst us?"
 Doth not God know best
 Those who are grateful?

54. When those come to thee
 Who believe in Our Signs,
 Say: "Peace be on you:
 Your Lord hath inscribed
 For Himself (the rule
 Of) Mercy: verily,
 If any of you did evil
 In ignorance, and thereafter

Repented, and amended
 (His conduct), lo! He is
 Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.

55. Thus do We explain
 The Signs in detail:
 That the way of the sinners
 May be shown up.

  

SECTION 7.

56. Say: "I am forbidden
 To worship those--others
 Than God--whom ye
 Call upon." Say: "I will
 Not follow your vain desires:
 If I did, I would stray
 From the path, and be not
 Of the company of those
 Who receive guidance."

57. Say; "For me, I (work)
 On a clear Sign from my Lord,
 But ye reject Him. What ye
 Would see hastened, is not
 In my power. The Command
 Rests with none but God:
 He declares the Truth,
 And He is the best of judges."

58. Say: "If what ye would see
 Hastened were in my power,
 The matter would be settled
 At once between you and me.

But God knoweth best
 Those who do wrong."

59. With Him are the keys
 Of the Unseen, the treasures
 That none knoweth but He.
 He knoweth whatever there is
 On the earth and in the sea.
 Not a leaf doth fall
 But with His knowledge:
 There is not a grain
 In the darkness (or depths)
 Of the earth, nor anything
 Fresh or dry (green or withered),
 But is (inscribed) in a Record
 Clear (to those who can read).

60. It is He Who doth take
 Your souls by night,
 And hath knowledge of all
 That ye have done by day:
 By day doth He raise
 You up again; that a term
 Appointed be fulfilled;
 In the end unto Him
 Will be your return;
 Then will He show you
 The truth of all
 That ye did.

  

SECTION 8.

61. He is the Irresistible, (watching)
 From above over His worshippers,
 And He sets guardians 
 Over you. At length,
 When death approaches
 One of you, Our angels
 Take his soul, and they
 Never fail in their duty.

62. Then are men returned
 Unto God, their Protector,
 The (only) Reality:
 Is not His the Command?
 And He is the Swiftest
 In taking account.

63. Say: "Who is it
 That delivereth you
 From the dark recesses
 Of land and sea,
 When ye call upon Him
 In humility

And silent terror:
 If He only delivers us
 From these (dangers),
 (We vow) we shall truly
 Show our gratitude?"

64. Say: "It is God
 That delivereth you
 From these and all (other)
 Distresses: and yet
 Ye worship false gods!"

65. Say: "He hath power
 To send calamities
 On you, from above
 And below, or to cover
 You with confusion
 In party strife,
 Giving you a taste
 Of mutual vengeance--
 Each from the other."
 See how We explain
 The Signs by various (symbols);
 That they may understand.

66. But thy people reject
 This, though it is
 The Truth. Say: "Not mine
 Is the responsibility
 For arranging your affairs;

67. For every Message
 Is a limit of time,
 And soon shall ye
 Know it."

68. When thou seest men
 Engaged in vain discourse
 About Our Signs, turn
 Away from them unless
 They turn to a different
 Theme. If Satan ever
 Makes thee forget, then
 After recollection, sit not
 Thou in the company
 Of those who do wrong.

69. On their account
 No responsibility
 Falls on the righteous,
 But (their duty)
 Is to remind them,
 That they may (learn
 To) fear God.

70. Leave alone those
 Who take their religion
 To be mere play
 And amusement,
 And are deceived
 By the life of this world.
 But proclaim (to them)
 This (truth): that every soul
 Delivers itself to ruin
 By its own acts:
 It will find for itself
 No protector or intercessor
 Except God: if it offered
 Every ransom, (or
 Reparation), none
 Will be accepted: such is
 (The end of) those who
 Deliver themselves to ruin
 By their own acts:
 They will have for drink
 (Only) boiling water,

And for punishment,
 One most grievous:
 For they persisted
 In rejecting God.

  

SECTION 9.

71. Say: "Shall we indeed
 Call on others besides God,
 Things that can do us
 Neither good nor harm,--
 And turn on our heels
 After receiving guidance
 From God?--like one
 Whom the evil ones
 Have made into a fool,
 Wandering bewildered
 Through the earth, his friends
 Calling 'Come to us',
 (Vainly) guiding him to the Path."

Say: "God's guidance
 Is the (only) guidance,
 And we have been directed
 To submit ourselves
 To the Lord of the worlds;--

72. "To establish regular prayers
 And to fear God:
 For it is to Him
 That we shall be
 Gathered together."

73. It is He Who created
 The heavens and the earth
 In true (proportions):
 The day He saith, "Be,"

Behold! it is. His Word
 Is the Truth. His will be
 The dominion the day
 The trumpet will be blown.
 He knoweth the Unseen
 As well as that which is
 Open. For He
 Is the Wise, well acquainted
 (With all things).

74. Lo! Abraham said
 To his father Azar:
 "Takest thou idols for gods?
 For I see thee
 And thy people
 In manifest error."

75. So also did We show
 Abraham the power
 And the laws of the heavens
 And the earth, that he
 Might (with understanding)
 Have certitude.

76. When the night
 Covered him over,
 He saw a star:
 He said: "This is my Lord."
 But when it set,
 He said: "I love not
 Those that set."

77. When he saw the moon
 Rising in splendour,
 He said: "This is my Lord."
 But when the moon set,

He said: "Unless my Lord
 Guide me, I shall surely
 Be among those
 Who go astray.

78. When he saw the sun
 Rising in splendour,
 He said: "This is my Lord;
 This is the greatest (of all)."
 But when the sun set,
 He said: "O my people!
 I am indeed free
 From your (guilt)
 Of giving partners to God.

79. "For me, I have set
 My face, firmly and truly,
 Towards Him Who created
 The heavens and the earth,
 And never shall I give
 Partners to God."

80. His people disputed
 With him. He said:
 "(Come) ye to dispute
 With me, about God,
 When He (Himself)
 Hath guided me?
 I fear not (the beings)
 Ye associate with God:

Unless my Lord willeth,
 (Nothing can happen).
 My Lord comprehendeth
 In His knowledge all things.
 Will ye not (yourselves)
 Be admonished?

81. "How should I fear
 (The beings) ye associate
 With God, when ye
 Fear not to give partners
 To God without any warrant
 Having been given to you?
 Which of (us) two parties
 Hath more right to security?
 (Tell me) if ye know.

82. "It is those who believe
 And confuse not their beliefs
 With wrong--that are
 (Truly) in security, for they
 Are on (right) guidance."

  

SECTION 10.

83. That was the reasoning
 About Us, which
 We gave to Abraham
 (To use) against his people:

We raise whom We will,
 Degree after degree:
 For thy Lord is full
 Of wisdom and knowledge.

84. We gave him Isaac
 And Jacob: all (three)
 We guided:
 And before him,
 We guided Noah,
 And among his progeny,
 David, Solomon, Job,
 Joseph, Moses, and Aaron:
 Thus do We reward
 Those who do good:

85. And Zakariya and John,
 And Jesus and Elias:
 All in the ranks
 Of the Righteous:

86. And Isma'il and Elisha,
 And Jonas, and Lot:

And to all We gave
 Favour above the nations:

87. (To them) and to their fathers,
 And progeny and brethren:
 We chose them,
 And We guided them
 To a straight Way.

88. This is the Guidance
 Of God: He giveth
 That guidance to whom
 He pleaseth, of His worshippers.
 If they were to join
 Other gods with Him,
 All that they did
 Would be vain for them,

89. These were the men
 To whom We gave
 The Book, and Authority,
 And Prophethood: if these
 (Their descendants) reject them,
 Behold! We shall entrust
 Their charge to a new People
 Who reject them not.

90. Those were the (prophets)
 Who received God's guidance:
 Copy the guidance they received;
 Say: "No reward for this
 Do I ask of you:
 This is no less than
 A Message for the nations."

  

SECTION 11.

91. No just estimate of God
 Do they make when they say:

"Nothing doth God send down
 To man (by way of revelation)":
 Say: "Who then sent down
 The Book which Moses brought?--
 A light and guidance to man:
 But ye make it into
 (Separate) sheets for show,
 While ye conceal much
 (Of its contents): therein
 Were ye taught that
 Which ye knew not
 Neither ye nor your fathers."
 Say: "God (sent it down)":
 Then leave them to plunge
 In vain discourse and trifling.

92. And this is a Book
 Which We have sent down,
 Bringing blessings, and confirming
 (The revelations) which came
 Before it: that thou
 Mayest warn the Mother
 Of Cities and all around her.
 Those who believe
 In the Hereafter
 Believe in this (Book),
 And they are constant
 In guarding their Prayers.

93. Who can be more wicked
 Than one who inventeth

A lie against God,
 Or saith, "I have
 Received inspiration,"
 When he hath received
 None, or (again) who saith,
 "I can reveal the like
 Of what God hath revealed"?
 If thou couldst but see
 How the wicked (do fare)
 In the flood of confusion
 At death!--the angels
 Stretch forth their hands,
 (Saying), "Yield up your souls:
 This day shall ye receive
 Your reward,--a penalty
 Of shame, for that ye used
 To tell lies against God,
 And scornfully to reject
 Of His Signs!"

94. "And behold! ye come
 To Us bare and alone
 As We created you
 For the first time:
 Ye have left behind you
 All (the favours) which
 We bestowed on you:
 We see not with you
 Your intercessors
 Whom ye thought to be
 Partners in your affairs:
 So now all relations
 Between you have been
 Cut off, and your (pet) fancies
 Have left you in the lurch!

  

SECTION 12.

95. It is God Who causeth
 The seed-grain
 And the date-stone
 To split and sprout.
 He causeth the living
 To issue from the dead,
 And He is the One
 To cause the dead
 To issue from the living.
 That is God: then how
 Are ye deluded
 Away from the truth?

96. He it is that cleaveth
 The day-break (from the dark):
 He makes the night
 For rest and tranquillity,
 And the sun and moon
 For the reckoning (of time):
 Such is the judgment
 And ordering of (Him),
 The Exalted in Power,
 The Omniscient.

97. It is He Who maketh
 The stars (as beacons) for you,
 That ye may guide yourselves,
 With their help,
 Through the dark spaces
 Of land and sea:
 We detail Our Signs
 For people who know.

98. It is He Who hath
 Produced you
 From a single person:
 Here is a place of sojourn
 And a place of departure:
 We detail Our signs
 For people who understand.

99. It is He Who sendeth down
 Rain from the skies:
 With it We produce
 Vegetation of all kinds:
 From some We produce
 Green (crops), out of which
 We produce grain,
 Heaped up (at harvest);
 Out of the date-palm
 And its sheaths (or spathes)
 (Come) clusters of dates
 Hanging low and near:
 And (then there are) gardens
 Of grapes, and olives,
 And pomegranates,
 Each similar (in kind)
 Yet different (in variety):
 When they begin to bear fruit,
 Feast your eyes with the fruit
 And the ripeness thereof.
 Behold! in these things
 There are Signs for people
 Who believe.

100.Yet they make
 The Jinns equals
 With God, though God
 Did create the Jinns;
 And they falsely,
 Having no knowledge,
 Attribute to Him
 Sons and daughters.
 Praise and glory be
 To Him! (for He is) above
 What they attribute to Him!

  

SECTION 13.

101. To Him is due
 The primal origin
 Of the heavens and the earth:
 How can He have a son
 When He hath no consort?
 He created all things,
 And He hath full knowledge
 Of all things.

102. That is God, your Lord!
 There is no god but He,
 The Creator of all things:
 Then worship ye Him:
 And He hath power
 To dispose of all affairs.

103. No vision can grasp Him,
 But His grasp is over

All vision: He is
 Above all comprehension,
 Yet is acquainted with all things.

104. "Now have come to you,
 From your Lord, proofs
 (To open your eyes):
 If any will see,
 It will be for (the good
 Of) his own soul;
 If any will be blind,
 It will be to his own
 (Harm): I am not (here)
 To watch over your doings.

105. Thus do We explain
 The Signs by various (symbols):
 That they may say,
 "Thou hast taught (us) diligently,"
 And that We may make
 The matter clear
 To those who know.

106. Follow what thou art taught
 By inspiration from thy Lord:
 There is no god but He:
 And turn aside from those
 Who join gods with God.

107. If it had been God's Plan,
 They would not have taken
 False gods: but We
 Made thee not one
 To watch over their doings,
 Nor art thou set
 Over them to dispose
 Of their affairs.

108. Revile not ye
 Those whom they call upon
 Besides God, lest
 They out of spite
 Revile God
 In their ignorance.
 Thus have We made
 Alluring to each people'
 Its own doings.
 In the end will they
 Return to their Lord,
 And We shall then

Tell them the truth
 Of all that they did.

109. They swear their strongest
 Oaths by God, that if
 A (special) Sign came
 To them, by it they would
 Believe. Say: "Certainly
 (All) Signs are in the power
 Of God: but what will
 Make you (Muslims) realise
 That (even) if (special) Signs
 Came, they will not believe."?

110. We (too) shall turn
 To (confusion) their hearts
 And their eyes, even as they
 Refused to believe in this
 In the first instance:
 We shall leave them
 In their trespasses,
 To wander in distraction.

  

SECTION 14.

111. Even if We did send
 Unto them angels,
 And the dead did speak
 Unto them, and We gathered
 Together all things before
 Their very eyes, they are not
 The ones to believe,
 Unless it is in God's Plan.
 But most of them
 Ignore (the truth).

112. Likewise did We make
 For every Messenger
 An enemy,--evil ones
 Among men and Jinns,
 Inspiring each other
 With flowery discourses
 By way of deception.
 If thy Lord had so planned,
 They would not have
 Done it: so leave them
 And their inventions alone.

113. To such (deceit)
 Let the hearts of those
 Incline, who have no faith
 In the Hereafter: let them
 Delight in it, and let them
 Earn from it what they may

114. Say: "Shall I seek
 For judge other than God?--
 When He it is
 Who hath sent unto you
 The Book, explained in detail."
 They know full well,
 To whom We have given
 The Book, that it hath been
 Sent down from thy Lord
 In truth. Never be then
 Of those who doubt.

115. The Word of thy Lord
 Doth find its fulfilment
 In truth and in justice:
 None can change His Words:
 For He is the one Who
 Heareth and knoweth all.

116. Wert thou to follow
 The common run of those
 On earth, they will lead
 Thee away from the Way
 Of God. They follow
 Nothing but conjecture: they
 Do nothing but lie.

117. Thy Lord knoweth best
 Who strayeth from His Way:
 He knoweth best
 Who they are that receive
 His guidance.

118. So eat of (meats)
 On which God's name
 Hath been pronounced,
 If ye have faith
 In His Signs.

119. Why should ye not
 Eat of (meats) on which
 God's name hath been
 Pronounced, when He hath
 Explained to you in detail
 What is forbidden to you--

Except under compulsion
 Of necessity?
 But many do mislead (men)
 By their appetites unchecked
 By knowledge. Thy Lord
 Knoweth best those who transgress

120. Eschew all sin,
 Open or secret:
 Those who earn sin
 Will get due recompense
 For their "earnings."

121. Eat not of (meats)
 On which God's name
 Hath not been pronounced:
 That would be impiety.
 But the evil ones
 Ever inspire their friends
 To contend with you
 If ye were to obey them,
 Ye would indeed be Pagans.

  

SECTION 15.

122. Can he who was dead,
 To whom We gave life,
 And a Light whereby
 He can walk amongst men,
 Be like him who is
 In the depths of darkness,
 From which he can
 Never come out?
 Thus to those without Faith
 Their own deeds seem pleasing.

123. Thus have We placed
 Leaders in every town,

Its wicked men, to plot
 (And burrow) therein:
 But they only plot
 Against their own souls,
 And they perceive it not.

124. When there comes to them
 A Sign (from God),
 They say: "We shall not
 Believe until we receive
 One (exactly) like those
 Received by God's apostles."
 God knoweth best where
 (And how) to carry out
 His mission. Soon
 Will the wicked
 Be overtaken by
 Humiliation before God,
 And a severe punishment,
 For all their plots.

125. Those whom God (in His Plan)
 Willeth to guide,--He openeth
 Their breast to Islam;
 Those whom He willeth
 To leave straying,--He maketh
 Their breast close and constricted,
 As if they had to climb
 Up to the skies: thus
 Doth God (heap) the penalty
 On those who refuse to believe.

126. This is the Way
 Of thy Lord, leading straight:

We have detailed the Signs
 For those who
 Receive admonition.

127. For them will be a Home
 Of Peace in the presence
 Of their Lord: He will be
 Their Friend, because
 They practised (righteousness).

128. One day will He gather
 Them all together, (and say):
 "O ye assembly of Jinns!
 Much (toll) did ye take
 Of men." Their friends
 Amongst men will say:
 "Our Lord! we made profit no
 From each other: but (alas!)
 We reached our term--
 Which Thou didst appoint
 For us." He will say:
 "The Fire be your dwelling-place:
 You will dwell therein for ever,
 Except as God willeth."
 For thy Lord is full
 Of wisdom and knowledge.

129. Thus do We make
 The wrong-doers turn
 To each other, because
 Of what they earn.

  

SECTION 16.

130. "O ye assembly of Jinns
 And men! came there not
 Unto you apostles from amongst you
 Setting forth unto you
 My Signs, and warning you
 Of the meeting of this Day
 Of yours?" They will say:
 "We bear witness against
 Ourselves." It was
 The life of this world
 That deceived them. So
 Against themselves will they
 Bear witness that they
 Rejected Faith.

131. (The apostles were sent) thus,
 For thy Lord would not
 Destroy for their wrong-doing
 Men's habitations whilst
 Their occupants were unwarned.

132. To all are degrees (or ranks)
 According to their deeds:
 For thy Lord
 Is not unmindful
 Of anything that they do.

133. Thy Lord is Self-sufficient,
 Full of Mercy: if it were
 His Will, He could destroy
 You, and in your place
 Appoint whom He will
 As your successors, even as
 He raised you up
 From the posterity
 Of other people.

134. All that hath been
 Promised unto you
 Will come to pass:
 Nor can ye frustrate it
 (In the least bit).

135. Say: "O my people!
 Do whatever ye can:
 I will do (my part):
 Soon will ye know
 Who it is whose end
 Will be (best) in the Hereafter:
 Certain it is that
 The wrong-doers will not prosper."

136. Out of what God
 Hath produced in abundance
 In tilth and in cattle,
 They assigned Him a share:
 They say, according to their fancies:
 "This is for God, and this"--
 For Our "partners"!
 But the share of their "partners"
 Reacheth not God, whilst
 The share of God reacheth
 Their "partners"! Evil
 (And unjust) is their assignment!

137. Even so, in the eyes
 Of most of the Pagans,
 Their "partners" made alluring
 The slaughter of their children,
 In order to lead them
 To their own destruction,
 And cause confusion
 In their religion.
 If God had willed,
 They would not have done so:
 But leave alone
 Them and their inventions.

138. And they say that
 Such and such cattle and crops
 Are taboo, and none should
 Eat of them except those
 Whom--so they say--We
 Wish; further, there are
 Cattle forbidden to yoke
 Or burden, and cattle
 On which, (at slaughter),
 The name of God is not
 Pronounced;--inventions
 Against God's name: soon
 Will He requite them
 For their inventions.

139. They say: "What is
 In the wombs of
 Such and such cattle
 Is specially reserved
 (For food) for our men,
 And forbidden to our women;
 But if it is still-born,
 Then all have shares therein.

For their (false) attribution
 (Of superstitions to God),
 He will soon punish them:
 For He is full
 Of wisdom and knowledge.

140. Lost are those who slay
 Their children, from folly,
 Without knowledge, and forbid
 Food which God hath provided
 For them, inventing (lies)
 Against God. They have
 Indeed gone astray
 And heeded no guidance.

  

SECTION 17.

141. It is He who produceth
 Gardens, with trellises
 And without, and dates,
 And tilth with produce
 Of all kinds, and olives
 And pomegranates,
 Similar (in kind)
 And different (in variety):
 Eat of their fruit
 In their season, but render
 The dues that are proper
 On the day that the harvest
 Is gathered. But waste not
 By excess: for God
 Loveth not the wasters.

142. Of the cattle are some
 For burden and some for meat:

Eat what God hath provided
 For you, and follow not
 The footsteps of Satan:
 For he is to you
 An avowed enemy.

143. (Take) eight (head of cattle)
 In (four) pairs:
 Of sheep a pair,
 And of goats a pair;
 Say, hath He forbidden
 The two males,
 Or the two females,
 Or (the young) which the wombs
 Of the two females enclose?
 Tell me with knowledge
 If ye are truthful:

144. Of camels a pair,
 And of oxen a pair;
 Say, hath He forbidden
 The two males,
 Or the two females,
 Or (the young) which the wombs
 Of the two females enclose?--
 Were ye present when God
 Ordered you such a thing?
 But who doth more wrong
 Than one who invents
 A lie against God,
 To lead astray men
 Without knowledge?
 For God guideth not
 People who do wrong

  

SECTION 18.

145. Say: "I find not
 In the Message received
 By me by inspiration
 Any (meat) forbidden
 To be eaten by one
 Who wishes to eat it,
 Unless it be dead meat,
 Or blood poured forth,

Or the flesh of swine,--
 For it is an abomination--
 Or, what is impious, (meat)
 On which a name has been
 Invoked, other than God's."
 But (even so), if a person
 Is forced by necessity,
 Without wilful disobedience,
 Nor transgressing due limits,--
 Thy Lord is Oft-forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

146. For those who followed
 The Jewish Law, We forbade
 Every (animal) with
 Undivided hoof,
 And We forbade them
 The fat of the ox
 And the sheep, except
 What adheres to their backs
 Or their entrails,
 Or is mixed up
 With a bone:
 This in recompense
 For their wilful disobedience:
 For We are True
 (In Our ordinances).

147. If they accuse thee
 Of falsehood, say:
 "Your Lord is full
 Of mercy all-embracing;
 But from people in guilt
 Never will His wrath
 Be turned back.

148. Those who give partners
 (To God) will say:

"If God had wished,
 We should not have
 Given partners to Him,
 Nor would our fathers;
 Nor should we have had
 Any taboos." So did
 Their ancestors argue
 Falsely, until they tasted
 Of Our wrath. Say:
 "Have ye any (certain)
 Knowledge? If so, produce
 It before us. Ye follow
 Nothing but conjecture:
 Ye do nothing but lie."

149. Say: "With God is the argument
 That reaches home: if it had
 Been His Will, He could
 Indeed have guided you all."

150. Say: "Bring forward your witnesses
 To prove that God did
 Forbid so and so." If they
 Bring such witnesses,
 Be not thou amongst them:
 Nor follow thou the vain
 Desires of such as treat
 Our Signs as falsehoods,
 And such as believe not
 In the Hereafter: for they
 Hold others as equal
 With their Guardian-Lord.

  

SECTION 19.

151. Say: "Come, I will rehearse
 What God hath (really)
 Prohibited you from": join not
 Anything as equal with Him;
 Be good to your parents;
 Kill not your children
 On a plea of want;--We
 Provide sustenance for you
 And for them;--come not
 Nigh to shameful deeds,
 Whether open or secret;
 Take not life, which God
 Hath made sacred, except
 By way of justice and law:
 Thus doth He command you,
 That ye may learn wisdom.

152. And come not nigh
 To the orphan's property,
 Except to improve it,
 Until he attain the age
 Of full strength; give measure
 And weight with (full) justice;--
 No burden do We place
 On any soul, but that
 Which it can bear;--
 Whenever ye speak, speak justly,

Even if a near relative
 Is concerned; and fulfil
 The Covenant of God:
 Thus doth He command you,
 That ye may remember.

153. Verily, this is My Way,
 Leading straight: follow it:
 Follow not (other) paths:
 They will scatter you about
 From His (great) Path:
 Thus doth He command you,
 That ye may be righteous.

154. Moreover, We gave Moses
 The Book, completing
 (Our favour) to those
 Who would do right,
 And explaining all things
 In detail,--and a guide
 And a mercy, that they
 Might believe in the meeting
 With their Lord.

  

SECTION 20.

155. And this is a Book
 Which We have revealed
 As a blessing: so follow it
 And be righteous, that ye
 May receive mercy:

156. Lest ye should say:
 "The Book was sent down
 To two Peoples before us,
 And for our part, we
 Remained unacquainted

With all that they learned
 By assiduous study;"

157. Or lest ye should say:
 "If the Book had only
 Been sent down to us,
 We should have followed
 Its guidance better than they."
 Now then hath come
 Unto you a Clear (Sign)
 From your Lord,--and a guide
 And a mercy: then who
 Could do more wrong
 Than one who rejecteth
 God's Signs, and turneth
 Away therefrom? In good time
 Shall We requite those
 Who turn away from Our Signs,
 With a dreadful penalty,
 For their turning away.

158. Are they waiting to see
 If the angels come to them,
 Or thy Lord (Himself),
 Or certain of the Signs
 Of thy Lord!
 The day that certain
 Of the Signs of thy Lord
 Do come, no good
 Will it do to a soul
 To believe in them then,
 If it believed not before
 Nor earned righteousness
 Through its Faith. Say:
 "Wait ye: we too
 Are waiting."

159. As for those who divide
 Their religion and break up
 Into sects, thou hast
 No part in them in the least:
 Their affair is with God:
 He will in the end
 Tell them the truth
 Of all that they did.

160. He that doeth good
 Shall have ten times
 As much to his credit:
 He that doeth evil
 Shall only be recompensed
 According to his evil:
 No wrong shall be done
 Unto (any of) them.

161. Say: "Verily, my Lord
 Hath guided me to
 A Way that is straight,--
 A religion of right,
 The Path (trod) by Abraham
 The true in faith,
 And he (certainly)
 Joined not gods with God."

162. Say: "Truly, my prayer
 And my service of sacrifice,
 My life and my death,
 Are (all) for God,
 The Cherisher of the Worlds:

163. No partner hath He:
 This am I commanded,
 And I am the first
 Of those who bow
 To His Will.

164. Say: "Shall I seek
 For (my) Cherisher

Other than God,
 When He is the Cherisher
 Of all things (that exist)?
 Every soul draws the meed
 Of its acts on none
 But itself: no bearer
 Of burdens can bear
 The burden of another.
 Your goal in the end
 Is towards God: He will tell
 You the truth of the things
 Wherein ye disputed."

165. It is He Who hath made
 You (His) agents, inheritors
 Of the earth: He hath raised
 You in ranks, some above
 Others: that He may try you
 In the gifts He hath given you:
 For thy Lord is quick
 In punishment: yet He
 Is indeed Oft-forgiving,
 Most Merciful.



  

Sura VII.

  

A'raf, or the Heights



1. Alif, Lam, Mim, Sad.

2. A Book revealed unto thee,--
 So let thy heart be oppressed'
 No more by any difficulty
 On that account,
 That with it thou mightest
 Warn (the erring) and teach
 The Believers.

3. Follow (O men!) the revelation
 Given unto you from your Lord,
 And follow not, as friends
 Or protectors, other than Him.
 Little it is ye remember
 Of admonition.

4. How many towns have We
 Destroyed (for their sins)?
 Our punishment took them
 On a sudden by night
 Or while they slept
 For their afternoon rest.

5. When (thus) Our punishment
 Took them, no cry
 Did they utter but this:
 "Indeed we did wrong."

6. When shall we question
 Those to whom Our Message
 Was sent and those by whom
 We sent it.

7. And verily We shall recount
 Their whole story
 With knowledge, for We
 Were never absent
 (At any time or place).

8. The balance that day
 Will be true (to a nicety):
 Those whose scale (of good)
 Will be heavy, will prosper:

9. Those whose scale will be light,
 Will find their souls
 In perdition, for that they
 Wrongfully treated Our Signs.

10. It is We Who have
 Placed you with authority
 On earth, and provided
 You therein with means
 For the fulfilment of your life:
 Small are the thanks
 That ye give!

  

SECTION 2.

11. It is We Who created you
 And gave you shape;
 Then We bade the angels
 Bow down to Adam, and they
 Bowed down; not so Iblis;
 He refused to be of those
 Who bow down.

12. (God) said: "What prevented
 Thee from bowing down
 When I commanded thee?"
 He said: "I am better
 Than he: Thou didst create
 Me from fire, and him from clay."

13. (God) said: "Get thee down
 From this: it is not
 For thee to be arrogant
 Here: get out, for thou
 Art of the meanest (of creatures)."

14. He said: "Give me respite
 Till the day they are
 Raised up."

15. (God) said: "Be thou
 Among those who have respite."

16. He said: "Because thou
 Hast thrown me out
 Of the Way, lo! I will
 Lie in wait for them
 On Thy Straight Way:

17. "Then will I assault them
 From before them and behind them,
 From their right and their left:
 Nor wilt Thou find,
 In most of them,
 Gratitude (for Thy mercies).

18. (God) said: "Get out
 From this, disgraced
 And expelled. If any
 Of them follow thee,--
 Hell will I fill
 With you all.

19. "O Adam! dwell thou
 And thy wife in the Garden,
 And enjoy (its good things)
 As ye wish: but approach not
 This tree, or ye run
 Into harm and transgression."

20. Then began Satan to whisper
 Suggestions to them, bringing
 Openly before their minds
 All their shame

That was hidden from them
 (Before): he said: "Your Lord
 Only forbade you this tree,
 Lest ye should become angels
 Or such beings as live for ever."

21. And he swore to them
 Both, that he was
 Their sincere adviser.

22. So by deceit he brought about
 Their fall: when they
 Tasted of the tree,
 Their shame became manifest
 To them, and they began
 To sew together the leaves
 Of the Garden over their bodies.
 And their Lord called
 Unto them: "Did I not
 Forbid you that tree,
 And tell you that Satan
 Was an avowed
 Enemy unto you?"

23. They said: "Our Lord!
 We have wronged our own souls:
 If Thou forgive us not
 And bestow not upon us
 Thy Mercy, we shall
 Certainly be lost."

24. (God) said: "Get ye down,
 With enmity between yourselves.
 On earth will be your dwelling-place
 And your means of livelihood,--
 For a time."

25. He said: "Therein shall ye
 Live, and therein shall ye
 Die; but from it shall ye
 Be taken out (at last)."

  

SECTION 3.

26. O ye Children of Adam!
 We have bestowed raiment
 Upon you to cover
 Your shame, as well as
 To be an adornment to you.
 But the raiment of righteousness,--
 That is the best.
 Such are among the Signs
 Of God, that they
 May receive admonition!

27. O ye Children of Adam!
 Let not Satan seduce you,
 In the same manner as
 He got your parents out
 Of the Garden, stripping them
 Of their raiment, to expose
 Their shame: for he
 And his tribe watch you
 From a position where ye
 Cannot see them: We made
 The Evil Ones friends
 (Only) to those without Faith.

28. When they do aught
 That is shameful, they say:
 "We found our fathers
 Doing so"; and "God
 Commanded us thus":
 Say: "Nay, God never

Commands what is shameful:
 Do ye say of God
 What ye know not?"

29. Say: "My Lord hath commanded
 Justice; and that ye set
 Your whole selves (to Him)
 At every time and place
 Of prayer, and call upon Him,
 Making your devotion sincere
 As in His sight:
 Such as He created you
 In the beginning, so
 Shall ye return."

30. Some He hath guided:
 Others have (by their choice)
 Deserved the loss of their way;
 In that they took
 The Evil Ones, in preference
 To God, for their friends
 And protectors, and think
 That they receive guidance.

31. O Children of Adam!
 Wear your beautiful apparel
 At every time and place
 Of prayer: eat and drink:
 But waste not by excess,
 For God loveth not the wasters.

  

SECTION 4.

32. Say: Who hath forbidden
 The beautiful (gifts) of God,
 Which He hath produced
 For His servants,
 And the things, clean and pure,
 (Which He hath provided)
 For sustenance?
 Say: They are, in the life
 Of this world, for those
 Who believe, (and) purely
 For them on the Day
 Of Judgment. Thus do We
 Explain the Signs in detail
 For those who understand.

33. Say: The things that my Lord
 Hath indeed forbidden are:
 Shameful deeds, whether open
 Or secret; sins and trespasses
 Against truth or reason; assigning
 Of partners to God, for which
 He hath given no authority;
 And saying things about God
 Of which ye have no knowledge.

34. To every People is a term.
 Appointed: when their term
 Is reached, not an hour
 Can they cause delay,
 Nor (an hour) can they
 Advance (it in anticipation).

35. O ye Children of Adam!
 Whenever there come to you
 Apostles from amongst you,
 Rehearsing My Signs unto you,
 Those who are righteous
 And mend (their lives),--
 On them shall be no fear
 Nor shall they grieve.

36. But those who reject
 Our Signs and treat them
 With arrogance,--they
 Are Companions of the Fire,
 To dwell therein (for ever).

37. Who is more unjust
 Than one who invents
 A lie against God
 Or rejects His Signs?
 For such, their portion
 Appointed must reach them
 From the Book (of Decrees):
 Until, when Our messengers
 (Of death) arrive and take
 Their souls, they say:
 "Where are the things
 That ye used to invoke
 Besides God?"
 They will reply, "They

Have left us in the lurch,"
 And they will bear witness
 Against themselves, that they
 Had rejected God.

38. He will say: "Enter ye
 In the company of
 The Peoples who passed away
 Before you--men and Jinns,--
 Into the Fire. Every time
 A new People enters,
 It curses its sister-People
 (That went before), until
 They follow each other, all
 Into the Fire. Saith the last
 About the first: "Our Lord!
 It is these that misled us:
 So give them a double
 Penalty in the Fire."
 He will say: "Doubled
 For all": but this
 Ye do not understand.

39. Then the first will say
 To the last: "See then!
 No advantage have ye
 Over us; so taste ye
 Of the Penalty for all
 That ye did!"

  

SECTION 5.

40. To those who reject
 Our Signs and treat them
 With arrogance, no opening
 Will there be of the gates

Of heaven, nor will they
 Enter the Garden, until
 The camel can pass
 Through the eye of the needle:
 Such is Our reward
 For those in sin.

41. For them there is
 Hell, as a couch
 (Below) and folds and folds
 Of covering above: such
 Is Our requital of those
 Who do wrong.

42. But those who believe
 And work righteousness,--
 No burden do We place
 On any soul, but that
 Which it can bear,
 They will be Companions
 Of the Garden, therein
 To dwell (for ever).

43. And We shall remove
 From their hearts any
 Lurking sense of injury;--
 Beneath them will be
 Rivers flowing;--and they
 Shall say: "Praise be, to God,
 Who hath guided us
 To this (felicity): never
 Could we have found
 Guidance, had it not been
 For the guidance of God:
 Indeed it was the truth.
 That the Apostles of our Lord
 Brought unto us." And they
 Shall hear the cry:
 "Behold! the Garden before you!

Ye have been made
 Its inheritors, for your
 Deeds (of righteousness)."

44. The Companions of the Garden
 Will call out to the Companions
 Of the Fire: "We have
 Indeed found the promises
 Of our Lord to us true:
 Have you also found
 Your Lord's promises true?"
 They shall say, "Yes"; but
 A Crier shall proclaim
 Between them: "The curse
 Of God is on the wrong-doers;--

45. "Those who would hinder (men)
 From the path of God
 And would seek in it
 Something crooked:
 They were those who
 Denied the Hereafter."

46. Between them shall be
 A veil, and on the Heights

Will be men
 Who would know every one
 By his marks: they will call
 Out to the Companions
 Of the Garden, "Peace on you":
 They will not have entered,
 But they will have
 An assurance (thereof.)

47. When their eyes shall be turned
 Towards the Companions
 Of the Fire, they will say:
 "Our Lord! send us not
 To the company
 Of the wrong-doers."

  

SECTION 6.

48. The men on the Heights
 Will call to certain men
 Whom they will know
 From their m arks, saying:
 "Of what profit to you
 Were your hoards and your
 Arrogant ways?

49. "Behold! are these not
 The men whom you swore
 That God with His Mercy
 Would never bless?
 Enter ye the Garden:
 No fear shall be on you,
 Nor shall ye grieve."

50. The Companions of the Fire
 Will call to the Companions
 Of the Garden: "Pour down
 To us water or anything

That God doth provide
 For your sustenance."
 They will say: "Both
 These things hath God forbidden
 To those who rejected Him;--

51. "Such as took their religion
 To be mere amusement
 And play, and were deceived
 By the life of the world."
 That day shall We forget them
 As they forgot the meeting
 Of this day of theirs,
 And as they were wont
 To reject Our Signs.

52. For We had certainly
 Sent unto them a Book,
 Based on knowledge,
 Which We explained
 In detail,--a guide
 And a mercy
 To all who believe.

53. Do they just wait
 For the final fulfilment
 Of the event? On the day
 The event is finally fulfilled,
 Those who disregarded it
 Before will say: "The apostles
 Of our Lord did indeed
 Bring true (tidings). Have we
 No intercessors now to intercede
 On our behalf? Or could we

Be sent back? Then should eve
 Behave differently from our
 Behaviour in the past."
 In fact they will have lost
 Their souls, and the things
 They invented will leave
 Them in the lurch.

  

SECTION 7.

54. Your Guardian-Lord
 Is God, Who created
 The heavens and the earth
 In six Days, and is firmly
 Established on the Throne
 (Of authority): He draweth
 The night as a veil
 O'er the day, each seeking
 The other in rapid succession:
 He created the sun,
 The moon, and the stars,
 (All) governed by laws
 Under His Command.
 Is it not His to create
 And to govern? Blessed
 Be God, the Cherisher
 And Sustainer of the Worlds!

55. Call on your Lord
 With humility and in private:

For God loveth not
 Those who trespass beyond bounds.

56. Do no mischief on the earth,
 After it hath been
 Set in order, but call
 On Him with fear
 And longing (in your hearts):
 For the Mercy of God
 Is (always) near
 To those who do good.

57. It is He Who sendeth
 The Winds like heralds
 Of glad tidings, going before
 His Mercy: when they have
 Carried the heavy-laden
 Clouds, We drive them
 To a land that is dead,
 Make rain to descend thereon,
 And produce every kind
 Of harvest therewith: thus
 Shall We raise up the dead:
 Perchance ye may remember.

58. From the land that is clean
 And good, by the Will
 Of its Cherisher, springs up
 Produce, (rich) after its kind:

But from the land that is
 Bad, springs up nothing
 But that which is niggardly:
 Thus do we explain the Signs
 By various (symbols) to those
 Who are grateful.

  

SECTION 8.

59. We sent Noah to his people.
 He said: "O my people!
 Worship God! ye have
 No other god but Him.
 I fear for you the Punishment
 Of a dreadful Day!

60. The leaders of his people
 Said: "Ah! we see thee
 Evidently wandering (in mind)."

61. He said: "O my people!
 No wandering is there
 In my (mind): on the contrary
 I am an apostle from
 The Lord and Cherisher
 Of the Worlds!

62."I but fulfil towards you
 The duties of my Lord's mission:
 Sincere is my advice to you,
 And I know from God
 Something that ye know not.

63. "Do ye wonder that
 There hath come to you
 A message from your Lord,
 Through a man of your own
 People, to warn you,--
 So that ye may fear God
 And haply receive His Mercy?"

64. But they rejected him,
 And We delivered him,
 And those with him,
 In the Ark:
 But We overwhelmed
 In the Flood those
 Who rejected Our Signs.
 They were indeed
 A blind people!

  

SECTION 9.

65. To the 'Ad people,
 (We sent) Hud, one

Of their (own) brethren:
 He said: "O my people!
 Worship God! ye have
 No other god but Him.
 Will ye not fear (God)?

66. The leaders of the unbelievers
 Among his people said:
 "Ah! we see thou art
 An imbecile!" and "We think
 Thou art a liar!"

67. He said: "O my people!
 I am no imbecile, but
 (I am) an apostle from
 The Lord and Cherisher
 Of the Worlds!

68. "I but fulfil towards you
 The duties of my Lord's mission:
 I am to you a sincere
 And trustworthy adviser.

69. "Do ye wonder that
 There hath come to you
 A message from your Lord
 Through a man of your own
 People, to warn you?
 Call in remembrance
 That He made you
 Inheritors after the people
 Of Noah, and gave you
 A stature tall among the nations.
 Call in remembrance
 The benefits (ye have received)
 From God: that so
 Ye may prosper."

70. They said: "Comest thou
 To us, that we may worship
 God alone, and give up
 The cult of our fathers?
 Bring us what thou
 Threatenest us with,
 If so be that thou
 Tellest the truth!"

71. He said: "Punishment
 And wrath have already
 Come upon you from your Lord
 Dispute ye with me
 Over names which ye
 Have devised--ye
 And your fathers,
 Without authority from God?
 Then wait: I am
 Amongst you, also waiting."

72. We saved him and those
 Who adhered to him,
 By Our Mercy, and We
 Cut off the roots of those
 Who rejected Our Signs
 And did not believe.

  

SECTION 10.

73. To the Thamud people
 (We sent) Salih, one

Of their own brethren:
 He said: "O my people!
 Worship God; ye have
 No other god but Him.
 Now hath come unto you
 A clear (Sign) from your Lord!
 This she-camel of God
 Is a Sign unto you:
 So leave her to graze
 In God's earth, and let her
 Come to no harm,
 Or ye shall be seized
 With a grievous punishment.

74. "And remember how He
 Made you inheritors
 After the 'Ad people
 And gave you habitations
 In the land: ye build
 For yourselves palaces and castles
 In (open) plains, and carve out
 Homes in the mountains;
 So bring to remembrance
 The benefits (ye have received)
 From God, and refrain
 From evil and mischief
 On the earth."

75. The leaders of the arrogant
 Party among his people said

To those who were reckoned
 Powerless--those among them
 Who believed: "Know ye
 Indeed that Salih is
 An apostle from his Lord?"
 They said: "We do indeed
 Believe in the revelation
 Which hath been sent
 Through him."

76. The arrogant party said:
 "For our part, we reject
 What ye believe in."

77. Then they ham-strung
 The she-camel, and insolently
 Defied the order of their Lord,
 Saying: "O Salih! bring about
 Thy threats, if thou art
 An apostle (of God)!"

78. So the earthquake took them
 Unawares, and they lay
 Prostrate in their homes
 In the morning!

79. So Salih left them,
 Saying: "O my people!
 I did indeed convey to you
 The message for which
 I was sent by my Lord:
 I gave you good counsel,
 But ye love not good counsellors!"

80. We also (sent) Lut:
 He said to his people:
 "Do ye commit lewdness
 Such as no people
 In creation (ever) committed
 Before you?

81. "For ye practise your lusts
 On men in preference
 To women: ye are indeed
 A people transgressing
 Beyond bounds."

82. And his people gave
 No answer but this:
 They said, "Drive them out
 Of your city: these are

Indeed men who want
 To be clean and pure!"

83. But we saved him
 And his family, except
 His wife: she was
 Of those who lagged behind

84. And we rained down on them
 A shower (of brimstone):
 Then see what was the end
 Of those who indulged
 In sin and crime!

  

SECTION 11.

85. To the Madyan people

We sent Shu'aib, one
 Of their own brethren: he said:
 "O my people! worship God;
 Ye have no other god
 But Him. Now hath come
 Unto you a clear (Sign)
 From your Lord! Give just
 Measure and weight, nor withhold
 From the people the things
 That are their due; and do
 No mischief on the earth
 After it has been set
 In order: that will be best
 For you, if ye have Faith.

86. "And squat not on every road,
 Breathing threats, hindering
 From the path of God
 Those who believe in Him,
 And seeking in it
 Something crooked;
 But remember how ye were
 Little, and He gave you increase.
 And hold in your mind's eye
 What was the end

Of those who did mischief.

87. "And if there is a party
 Among you who believes
 In the Message with which
 I have been sent, and a party
 Which does not believe,
 Hold yourselves in patience
 Until God doth decide
 Between us: for He
 Is the best to decide."

88. The leaders, the arrogant
 Party among his people, said:
 "O Shu'aib! we shall
 Certainly drive thee out
 Of our city--(thee) and those
 Who believe with thee;
 Or else ye (thou and they)
 Shall have to return
 To our ways and religion."
 He said: "What! even
 Though we do detest (them)?

89. "We should indeed invent
 A lie against God,
 If we returned to your ways
 After God hath rescued
 Us therefrom; nor could we
 By any manner of means
 Return thereto unless it be
 As in the will and plan of God,
 Our Lord. Our Lord
 Can reach out to the utmost
 Recesses of things by His
 knowledge.
 In God is our trust.
 Our Lord! Decide thou
 Between us and our people

In truth, for thou
 Art the best to decide."

90. The leaders, the Unbelievers
 Among his people, said:
 "If ye follow Shu'aib,
 Be sure then ye are ruined!"

91. But the earthquake took them
 Unawares, and they lay
 Prostrate in their homes
 Before the morning!"

92. The men who rejected
 Shu'aib became as if
 They had never been
 In the homes where they
 Had flourished: the men
 Who rejected Shu'aib--
 It was they who were ruined!

93. So Shu'aib left them,
 Saying: "O my people!
 I did indeed convey to you
 The Messages for which
 I was sent by my Lord:
 I gave you good counsel,
 But how shall I lament

Over a people who refuse
 To believe!"

  

SECTION 12.

94. Whenever We sent a prophet
 To a town, We took up
 Its people in suffering
 And adversity, in order
 That they might learn humility.

95. Then We changed their suffering
 Into prosperity, until they grew
 And multiplied, and began
 To say: "Our fathers (too)
 Were touched by suffering
 And affluence"... Behold!
 We called them to account
 Of a sudden, while they
 Realised not (their peril).

96. If the people of the towns
 Had but believed and feared
 God, We should indeed
 Have opened out to them

(All kinds of) blessings
 From heaven and earth;
 But they rejected (the truth),
 And We brought them
 To book for their misdeeds.

97. Did the people of the towns
 Feel secure against the coming
 Of Our wrath by night
 While they were asleep?

98. Or else did they feel
 Secure against its coming
 In broad daylight while they
 Played about (care-free)?

99. Did they then feel secure
 Against the Plan of God?--
 But no one can feel
 Secure from the Plan
 Of God, except those
 (Doomed) to ruin!

  

SECTION 13.

100. To those who inherit
 The earth in succession
 To its (previous) possessors,
 Is it not a guiding (lesson)
 That, if We so willed,
 We could punish them (too)
 For their sins, and seal up
 Their hearts so that they
 Could not hear?

101. Such were the towns
 Whose story We (thus)
 Relate unto thee:
 There came indeed to them
 Their apostles with clear (Signs):
 But they would not believe
 What they had rejected before.
 Thus doth God seal up
 The hearts of those
 Who reject Faith.

102. Most of them We found not
 Men (true) to their covenant:
 But most of them We found
 Rebellious and disobedient.

103. Then after them We sent
 Moses with Our Signs
 To Pharaoh and his chiefs,
 But they wrongfully rejected them:
 So see what was the end
 Of those who made mischief.

104. Moses said: "O Pharaoh!
 I am an apostle from
 The Lord of the Worlds,--

105. One for whom it is right
 To say nothing but truth
 About God. Now have I
 Come unto you (people), from
 Your Lord, with a clear (Sign):
 So let the Children of Israel
 Depart along with me."

106. (Pharaoh) said: "If indeed
 Thou hast come with a Sign,

Show it forth,
 If thou tellest the truth."

107. Then (Moses) threw his rod,
 And behold! it was
 A serpent, plain (for all to see)!

108. And he drew out his hand,
 And behold! it was white
 To all beholders!

  

SECTION 14.

109. Said the Chiefs of the people
 Of Pharaoh: "This is indeed
 A sorcerer well-versed.

110. "His plan is to get you out
 Of your land: then
 What is it ye counsel?"

111. They said: "Keep him
 And his brother in suspense
 (For a while); and send
 To the cities men to collect--

112. And bring up to thee
 All (our) sorcerers well-versed.

113. So there came
 The sorcerers to Pharaoh:
 They said, "Of course
 We shall have a (suitable)
 Reward if we win!"

114. He said: "Yea, (and more),--
 For ye shall in that case
 Be (raised to posts)
 Nearest (to my person)."

115. They said: "O Moses!
 Wilt thou throw (first),
 Or shall we have
 The (first) throw?"

116. Said Moses: "Throw ye (first)."
 So when they threw,
 They bewitched the eyes
 Of the people, and struck
 Terror into them: for they
 Showed a great (feat of) magic.

117. We put it into Moses's mind
 By inspiration: "Throw (now)
 Thy rod": and behold!
 It swallows up straightway
 All the falsehoods
 Which they fake!

118. Thus truth was confirmed.
 And all that they did
 Was made of no effect.

119. So the (great ones) were vanquished
 There and then, and were
 Made to look small.

120. But the sorcerers fell down
 Prostrate in adoration,

121. Saying: "We believe
 In the Lord of the Worlds,--

122. "The Lord of Moses and Aaron.

123. Said Pharaoh: "Believe ye
 In Him before I give
 You permission? Surely
 This is a trick which ye
 Have planned in the City
 To drive out its people:
 But soon shall ye know
 (The consequences).

124. "Be sure I will cut off
 Your hands and your feet
 On opposite sides, and I
 Will cause you all
 To die on the cross."

125. They said: "For us,
 We are but sent back
 Unto our Lord:

126. "But thou dost wreak
 Thy vengeance on us
 Simply because we believed
 In the Signs of our Lord
 When they reached us!
 Our Lord! pour out on us
 Patience and constancy, and take
 Our souls unto Thee
 As Muslims (who bow
 To Thy Will)!

  

SECTION 15.

127. Said the chiefs of Pharaoh's
 People: "Wilt thou leave
 Moses and his people,
 To spread mischief in the land,
 And to abandon thee
 And thy gods?" He said:
 "Their male children will we
 Slay; (only) their females
 Will we save alive;
 And we have over them

(Power) irresistible."

128. Said Moses to his people:
 "Pray for help from God,.
 And (wait) in patience and
 constancy:
 For the earth is God's,
 To give as a heritage
 To such of His servants
 As He pleaseth; and the end
 Is (best) for the righteous.

129. They said: "We have had
 (Nothing but) trouble, both before
 And after thou camest
 To us." He said:
 "It may be that your Lord
 Will destroy your enemy
 And make you inheritors 
 In the earth; that so
 He may try you
 By your deeds."

  

SECTION 16.

130. We punished the people
 Of Pharaoh with years

(Of drought) and shortness
 Of crops; that they might
 Receive admonition.

131. But when good (times) came,
 They said, "This is due
 To us;" when gripped
 By calamity, they ascribed it
 To evil omens connected
 With Moses and those with him!
 Behold! in truth the omens
 Of evil are theirs
 In God's sight, but most
 Of them do not understand!

132. They said (to Moses):
 "Whatever be the Signs
 Thou bringest, to work
 Therewith thy sorcery on us,"
 We shall never believe
 In thee."

133. So We sent (plagues) on them:
 Wholesale Death,
 Locusts, Lice, Frogs,
 And Blood: Signs openly
 Self-explained: but they
 Were steeped in arrogance,--
 A people given to sin.

134. Every time the Penalty
 Fell on them, they said:

"O Moses! on our behalf
 Call on thy Lord in virtue
 Of his promise to thee:
 If thou wilt remove
 The Penalty from us,
 We shall truly believe in thee,
 And we shall send away
 The Children of Israel
 With thee."

135. But every tune We removed
 The Penalty from them
 According to a fixed term
 Which they had to fulfil,--
 Behold! they broke their word!

136. So We exacted retribution
 From them: We drowned them
 In the sea, because they
 Rejected Our Signs, and failed
 To take warning from them.

137. And We made a people,
 Considered weak (and of no account),
 Inheritors of lands
 In both East and West,--

Lands whereon We sent
 Down Our blessings.
 The fair promise of thy Lord
 Was fulfilled for the Children
 Of Israel, because they had
 Patience and constancy,
 And We levelled to the ground
 The great Works and fine Buildings
 Which Pharaoh and his people
 Erected (with such pride).

138. We took the Children of Israel
 (With safety) across the sea.
 They came upon a people
 Devoted entirely to some idols
 They had. They said:
 "O Moses! fashion for us
 A god like unto the gods
 They have." He said:

"Surely ye are a people
 Without knowledge.

139. "As to these folk,--
 The cult they are in
 Is (but) a fragment of a ruin,
 And vain is the (worship)
 Which they practise."

140. He said: "Shall I seek for you
 A god other than the (true)
 God, when it is God
 Who hath endowed you
 With gifts above the nations?"

141. And remember We rescued you
 From Pharaoh's people,
 Who afflicted you with
 The worst of penalties,
 Who slew your male children
 And saved alive your females:
 In that was a momentous
 Trial from your Lord.

  

SECTION 17.

142. We appointed for Moses
 Thirty nights, and completed
 (The period) with ten (more):
 Thus was completed the term
 (Of communion) with his Lord,
 Forty nights. And Moses
 Had charged his brother Aaron
 (Before he went up):

"Act for me amongst my people:
 Do right, and follow not
 The way of those
 Who do mischief."

143. When Moses came
 To the place appointed by Us,
 And his Lord addressed him,
 He said: "O my Lord!
 Show (Thyself) to me,
 That I may look upon Thee."
 God said, "By no means
 Canst thou see Me (direct);
 But look upon the mount;
 If it abide
 In its place, then
 Shalt thou see Me."
 When his Lord manifested
 His glory on the Mount,
 He made it as dust,
 And Moses fell down
 In a swoon. When he
 Recovered his senses he said:
 "Glory be to Thee! To Thee
 I turn in repentance, and I
 Am the first to believe."

144. (God) said: "O Moses!
 I have chosen thee
 Above (other) men,
 By the mission I (have
 Given thee) and the words
 I (have spoken to thee):
 Take then the (revelation)
 Which I give thee,
 And be of those
 Who give thanks."

145. And We ordained laws
 For him in the Tablets
 In all matters, both
 Commanding and explaining
 All things, (and said):
 "Take and hold these
 With firmness, and enjoin
 Thy people to hold fast
 By the best in the precepts:
 Soon shall I show you
 The homes of the wicked,--
 (How they lie desolate)."

146. Those who behave arrogantly
 On the earth in defiance

Of right--them will I
 Turn away from My Signs:
 Even if they see all the Signs,
 They will not believe in them;
 And if they see the way
 Of right conduct, they will
 Not adopt it as the Way;
 But if they see the way
 Of error, that is
 The Way they will adopt.
 For they have rejected
 Our Signs, and failed
 To take warning from them.

147. Those who reject Our Signs
 And the Meeting in the Hereafter,--
 Vain are their deeds:
 Can they expect to be rewarded
 Except as they have wrought?

  

SECTION 18.

148. The people of Moses made,
 In his absence, out of their ornaments,

The image of a calf,
 (for worship):
 It seemed to low: did they
 Not see that it could
 Neither speak to them, nor
 Show them the Way?
 They took it for worship
 And they did wrong.

149. When they repented, and saw
 That they had erred,
 They said: "if our Lord
 Have not mercy upon us
 And forgive us, we shall
 Indeed be of those who perish."

150. When Moses came back
 To his people, angry and grieved,
 He said: "Evil it is that ye
 Have done in my place
 In my absence: did ye
 Make haste to bring on
 The judgment of your Lord?"
 He put down the Tablets,

Seized his brother by (the hair
 Of) his head, and dragged him
 To him. Aaron said:
 "Son of my mother! The people
 Did indeed reckon me
 As naught, and went near
 To slaying me! Make not
 The enemies rejoice over
 My misfortune, nor count thou
 Me amongst the people
 Of sin."

151. Moses prayed: "O my Lord!
 Forgive me and my brother!
 Admit us to Thy mercy!
 For Thou art the Most Merciful
 Of those who show mercy!"

  

SECTION 19.

152. Those who took the calf
 (For worship) will indeed
 Be overwhelmed with wrath
 From their Lord, and with
 Shame in this life:
 Thus do We recompense
 Those who invent (falsehoods).

153. But those who do wrong
 But repent thereafter and
 (Truly) believe,--verily
 Thy Lord is thereafter
 Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.

154. When the anger of Moses
 Was appeased, he took up
 The Tablets: in the writing
 Thereon was Guidance and Mercy
 For such as fear their Lord.

155. And Moses chose seventy
 Of his people for Our place
 Of meeting: when they
 Were seized with violent quaking,
 He prayed: "O my Lord!
 If it had been Thy Will
 Thou couldst have destroyed,
 Long before, both them
 And me: wouldst Thou
 Destroy us for the deeds
 Of the foolish ones among us?
 This is no more than
 Thy trial: by it Thou causest
 Whom Thou wilt to stray,
 And Thou leadest whom
 Thou wilt into the right path.
 Thou art our Protector:
 So forgive us and give us
 Thy mercy; for Thou art
 The Best of those who forgive.

156. "And ordain for us
 That which is good,
 In this life
 And in the Hereafter:
 For we have turned unto Thee."
 He said: "With My Punishment

I visit whom I will;
 But My Mercy extendeth
 To all things. That (Mercy)
 I shall ordain for those
 Who do right, and practise
 Regular charity, and those
 Who believe in Our Signs;--

157. "Those who follow the Apostle,
 The unlettered Prophet,
 Whom they find mentioned
 In their own (Scriptures),--
 In the Law and the Gospel;--
 For he commands them
 What is just and forbids them
 What is evil; he allows
 Them as lawful what is good
 (And pure) and prohibits them
 From what is bad (and impure);
 He releases them
 From their heavy burdens
 And from the yokes
 That are upon them.
 So it is those who believe
 In him, honour him,
 Help him, and follow the Light
 Which is sent down with him,--

It is they who will prosper."

  

SECTION 20.

158. Say: "O men! I am sent
 Unto you all, as the Apostle
 Of God, to Whom belongeth
 The dominion of the heavens
 And the earth: there is no god
 But He: it is He that giveth
 Both life and death. So believe
 In God and His Apostle,
 The unlettered Prophet,
 Who believeth in God
 And His Words: follow him
 That (so) ye may be guided."

159. Of the people of Moses
 There is a section
 Who guide and do justice
 In the light of truth.

160. We divided them into twelve Tribes
 Or nations. We directed
 Moses by inspiration,
 When his (thirsty) people asked
 Him for water: "Strike the rock
 With thy staff": out of it
 There gushed forth twelve springs:
 Each group knew its own place
 For water. We gave them
 The shade of clouds, and sent
 Down to them manna and quails,
 (Saying): "Eat of the good things
 We have provided for you":
 (But they rebelled); to Us
 They did no harm, but
 They harmed their own souls.

161. And remember it was
 Said to them:
 "Dwell in this town
 And eat therein as ye wish,
 But say the word of humility
 And enter the gate
 In a posture of humility:
 We shall forgive you
 Your faults; We shall increase
 (The portion of) those who do good."

162. But the transgressors among them
 Changed the word from that
 Which had been given them
 So we sent on them
 A plague from heaven.
 For that they repeatedly transgressed.

  

SECTION 21.

163. Ask them concerning the town
 Standing close by the sea.
 Behold! they transgressed

In the matter of the Sabbath.
 For on the day of their Sabbath
 Their fish did come to them,
 Openly holding up their heads,
 But on the day they had
 No Sabbath, they came not:
 Thus did We make a trial
 Of them, for they were
 Given to transgression.

164. When some of them said:
 "Why do ye preach
 To a people whom God
 Will destroy or visit
 With a terrible punishment?"--
 Said the preachers: "To discharge
 Our duty to your Lord,
 And perchance they may fear Him."

165. When they disregarded the warnings
 That had been given them,
 We rescued those who forbade
 Evil; but We visited
 The wrong-doers with a
 Grievous , because
 They were given to transgression.

166. When in their insolence
 They transgressed (all) prohibitions,
 We said to them:
 "Be ye apes,
 Despised and rejected."

167. Behold! thy Lord did declare
 That He would send
 Against them, to the Day
 Of Judgment, those who would
 Afflict them with grievous
 Penalty. Thy Lord is quick
 In retribution, but He is also
 Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.

168. We broke them up
 Into sections on this earth.
 There are among them some
 That are the righteous, and some
 That are the opposite.
 We have tried them
 With both prosperity and adversity:
 In order that they
 Might turn (to Us).

169. After them succeeded
 An (evil) generation: they
 Inherited the Book, but
 They chose (for themselves)
 The vanities of this world,
 Saying (for excuse): "(Everything)
 Will be forgiven us."
 (Even so), if similar vanities
 Came their way, they would
 (Again) seize them.
 Was not the Covenant
 Of the Book taken from them,
 That they would not
 Ascribe to God anything

But the truth? And they
 Study what is in the Book.
 But best for the righteous
 Is the Home in the Hereafter.
 Will ye not understand?

170. As to those who hold fast
 By the Book and establish
 Regular Prayer,--never
 Shall we suffer the reward
 Of the righteous to perish.

171. When We shook the Mount
 Over them, as if it had been
 A canopy, and they thought
 It was going to fall on them
 (We said): "Hold firmly
 To what We have given you,
 And bring (ever) to remembrance
 What is therein;
 Perchance ye may fear God."

  

SECTION 22.

172. When thy Lord drew forth
 From the Children of Adam--

From their loins--
 Their descendants, and made them
 Testify concerning themselves, (saying):
 "Am I not your Lord
 (Who cherishes and sustains you)?"--
 They said: "Yea!
 We do testify!" (This), lest
 Ye should say on the Day
 Of Judgment: "Of this we
 Were never mindful":

173. Or lest ye should say:
 "Our fathers before us
 May have taken false gods,
 But we are (their) descendants
 After them: wilt Thou then
 Destroy us because of the deeds
 Of men who were futile?"

174. Thus do We explain
 The Signs in detail;
 And perchance they may turn
 (Unto Us).

175. Relate to them the story
 Of the man to whom
 We sent Our Signs,
 But he passed them by:

So Satan followed him up,
 And he went astray.

176. If it had been Our Will,
 We should have elevated him
 With Our Signs; but he
 Inclined to the earth,
 And followed his own vain desires.
 His similitude is that
 Of a dog: if you attack
 Him, he lolls out his tongue,
 Or if you leave him alone,
 He (still) lolls out his tongue.
 That is the similitude
 Of those who reject Our Signs;
 So relate the story;
 Perchance they may reflect.

177. Evil as an example are
 People who reject Our Signs
 And wrong their own souls.

178. Whom God doth guide,
 He is on the right path:
 Whom He rejects from His guidance,--
 Such are the persons who perish.

179. Many are the Jinns and men
 We have made for Hell:
 They have hearts wherewith they
 Understand not, eyes wherewith

They see not, and ears wherewith
 They hear not. They are
 Like cattle,--nay more
 Misguided: for they
 Are heedless (of warning).

180. The most beautiful names
 Belong to God:
 So call on him by them;
 But shun such men as
 Use profanity in His names:
 For what they do, they will
 Soon be requited.

181. Of those We have created
 Are people who direct
 (Others) with truth.
 And dispense justice therewith,

  

SECTION 23.

182. Those who reject Our Signs,
 We shall gradually visit
 With punishment, in ways
 They perceive not;

183. Respite will I grant
 Unto them: for My scheme
 Is strong (and unfailing).

184. Do they not reflect?
 Their Companion is not seized

With madness: he is but
 A perspicuous warner.

185. Do they see nothing
 In the government of the heavens
 And the earth and all
 That God hath created?
 (Do they not see) that
 It may well be that
 Their term is nigh
 Drawing to an end?
 In what Message after this
 Will they then believe?

186. To such as God rejects
 From His guidance, there can be
 No guide: He will
 Leave them in their trespasses,
 Wandering in distraction.

187. Whey ask thee about
 The (final) Hour--when
 Will be its appointed time?
 Say: "The knowledge thereof
 Is with my Lord (alone):
 None but He can reveal
 As to when it will occur.
 Heavy were its burden through
 The heavens and the earth.
 Only, all of a sudden
 Will it come to you."
 They ask thee as if thou

Wert eager in search thereof:
 Say: "The knowledge thereof
 Is with God (alone),
 But most men know not."

188. Say: "I have no power
 Over any good or harm
 To myself except as God
 Willeth. If I had knowledge
 Of the unseen, I should have
 Multiplied all good, and no evil
 Should have touched me:
 I am but a warner,
 And a bringer of glad tidings
 To those who have faith."

  

SECTION 24.

189. It is He Who created
 You from a single person,
 And made his mate
 Of like nature, in order
 That he might dwell with her
 (In love). When they are
 United, she bears a light
 Burden and carries it about
 (Unnoticed). When she grows
 Heavy, they both pray
 To God their Lord, (saying):
 "If Thou givest us
 A goodly child,

We vow we shall
 (Ever) be grateful."

190. But when He giveth them
 A goodly child, they ascribe
 To others a share in the gift
 They have received:
 But God is exalted
 High above the partners
 They ascribe to Him.

191. Do they indeed ascribe
 To Him as partners things
 That can create nothing,
 But are themselves created?

192. No aid can they give them,
 Nor can they aid themselves!

193. If ye call them to guidance,
 They will not obey:
 For you it is the same
 Whether ye call them
 Or ye hold your peace!

194. Verily those whom ye
 Call upon besides God
 Are servants like unto you:
 Call upon them, and let them
 Listen to your prayer,
 If ye are (indeed) truthful!

195. Have they feet to walk with?
 Or hands to lay hold with?

Or eyes to see with?
 Or ears to hear with?
 Say: "Call your 'god-partners',
 Scheme (your worst) against me,
 And give me no respite!

196. "For my Protector is God,
 Who revealed the Book
 (From time to time),
 And He will choose
 And befriend the righteous.

197. "But those ye call upon
 Besides Him, are unable
 To help you, and indeed
 To help themselves."

198. If thou callest them
 To guidance, they hear not.
 Thou wilt see them
 Looking at thee, but
 They see not.

199. Hold to forgiveness;
 Command what is right;
 But turn away from the ignorant.

200. If a suggestion from Satan
 Assail thy (mind)

Seek refuge with God;
 For He heareth and knoweth
 (All things).

201. Those who fear God,
 When a thought of evil
 From Satan assaults them,
 Bring God to remembrance,
 When lo! they see (aright)!

202. But their brethren (the evil ones)
 Plunge them deeper into error,
 And never relax (their efforts).

203. If thou bring them not
 A revelation, they say:
 "Why hast thou not
 Got it together?"
 Say: "I but follow
 What is revealed to me
 From my Lord:
 This is (nothing but)
 Lights from your Lord,
 And Guidance, and Mercy,
 For any who have Faith."

204. When the Qur-an is read,
 Listen to it with attention,

And hold your peace:
 That ye may receive Mercy.

205. And do thou (O reader!)
 Bring thy Lord to remembrance
 In thy (very) soul,
 With humility and in reverence,
 Without loudness in words,
 In the mornings and evenings;
 And be not thou
 Of those who are unheedful.

206. Those who are near
 To thy Lord, disdain not
 To do Him worship:
 They celebrate His praises,
 And bow down before Him.



  

Sura VIII.

  

Anfal, or the Spoils of War.



1. They ask thee concerning
 (Things taken as) spoils of war.
 Say: "(Such) spoils are
 At the disposal of God
 And the Apostle: so fear
 God, and keep straight
 The relations between yourselves:
 Obey God and His Apostle,
 If ye do believe."

2. For, Believers are those
 Who, when God is mentioned,
 Feel a tremor in their hearts,
 And when they hear
 His Signs rehearsed, find
 Their faith strengthened,
 And put (all) their trust
 In their Lord;

3. Who establish regular prayers
 And spend (freely) out of
 The gifts We have given
 Them for sustenance:

4. Such in truth are the Believers:
 They have grades of dignity
 With their Lord, and forgiveness,
 And generous sustenance:

5. Just as thy Lord ordered thee
 Out of thy house in truth,
 Even though a party among
 The Believers disliked it,

6. Disputing with thee concerning
 The truth after it was made
 Manifest, as if they were
 Being driven to death
 And they (actually) saw it.

7. Behold! God promised you
 One of the two (enemy) parties,
 That it should be yours:
 Ye wished that the one
 Unarmed should be yours,
 But God willed
 To justify the Truth
 According to His words,
 And to cut off the roots
 Of the Unbelievers;--

8. That He might justify Truth
 And prove Falsehood false,
 Distasteful though it be
 To those in guilt.

9. Remember ye implored
 The assistance of your Lord,
 And He answered you:
 "I will assist you
 With a thousand of the angels,
 Ranks on ranks."

10. God made it but a message
 Of hope, and an assurance
 To your hearts: (in any case)
 There is no help.
 Except from God:
 And God is Exalted in Power,
 Wise.

  

SECTION 2.

11. Remember He covered you
 With a sort of drowsiness,
 To give you calm as from
 Himself, and he caused
 Rain to descend on you
 From heaven, to clean you
 Therewith, to remove from you
 The stain of Satan,
 To strengthen your hearts,
 And to plant your feet
 Firmly therewith.

12. Remember thy Lord inspired
 The angels (with the message):
 "I am with you: give
 Firmness to the Believers:

I will instil terror
 Into the hearts of the Unbelievers:
 Smite ye above their necks
 And smite all their
 Finger-tips off them.

13. This because they contended
 Against God and His Apostle:
 If any contend against God
 And His Apostle, God
 Is strict in punishment.

14. Thus (will it be said): "Taste ye
 Then of the (punishment):
 For those who resist God,
 Is the penalty of the Fire."

15. O ye who believe!
 When ye meet
 The Unbelievers
 In hostile array,
 Never turn your backs
 To them.

16. If any do turn his back
 To them on such a day--
 Unless it be in a stratagem
 Of war, or to retreat
 To a troop (of his own)--
 He draws on himself
 The wrath of God,
 And his abode is Hell,--
 An evil refuge (indeed)!

17. It is not ye who
 Slew them; it was God:

When thou threwest (a handful
 Of dust), it was not
 Thy act, but God's:
 In order that He might
 Test the Believers
 By a gracious trial
 From Himself: for God
 Is He Who heareth
 And knoweth (all things).

18. That, and also because
 God is He Who makes feeble
 The plans and stratagems
 Of the Unbelievers.

19. (O Unbelievers!) if ye prayed
 For victory and judgment,
 Now hath the judgment
 Come to you: if ye desist
 (From wrong), it will be
 Best for you: if ye return
 (To the attack), so shall We.
 Not the least good
 Will your forces be to you
 Even if they were multiplied:
 For verily God
 Is with those who believe!

  

SECTION 3.

20. O ye who believe!
 Obey God and His Apostle,
 And turn not away from him
 When ye hear (him speak).

21. Nor be like those who say,
 "We hear," but listen not:

22. For the worst of beasts
 In the sight of God
 Are the deaf and the dumb,--
 Those who understand not.

23. If God had found in them
 Any good, He would indeed
 Have made them listen:
 (As it is), if He had made them
 Listen, they would but have
 Turned back and declined (faith).

24. O ye who believe!
 Give your response to God
 And His Apostle, when He
 Calleth you to that which
 Will give you life;
 And know that God
 Cometh in between a man
 And his heart, and that
 It is He to Whom
 Ye shall (all) be gathered.

25. And fear tumult or oppression,
 Which affecteth not in particular
 (Only) those of you who do wrong:
 And know that God
 Is strict in punishment.

26. Call to mind when ye
 Were a small (band),
 Despised through the land,
 And afraid that men might
 Despoil and kidnap you;
 But He provided a safe asylum
 For you, strengthened you
 With His aid, and gave you
 Good things for sustenance:
 That ye might be grateful.

27. O ye that believe!
 Betray not the trust
 Of God and the Apostle,
 Nor misappropriate knowingly
 Things entrusted to you.

28. And know ye
 That your possessions

And your progeny
 Are but a trial;
 And that it is God
 With whom lies
 Your highest reward.

  

SECTION 4

29. O ye who believe!
 If ye fear God,
 He will grant you a Criterion
 (To judge between right and wrong),
 Remove from you (all) evil
 (That may afflict) you,
 And forgive you:
 For God is the Lord
 Of grace unbounded.

30. Remember how the Unbelievers
 Plotted against thee, to keep
 Thee in bonds, or slay thee,
 Or get thee out (of thy home).
 They plot and plan,
 And God too plans,
 But the best of planners
 Is God.

31. When Our Signs are rehearsed
 To them, they say: "We
 Have heard this (before):
 If we wished, we could
 Say (words) like these:
 These are nothing
 But tales of the ancients."

32. Remember how they said:
 "O God! if this is indeed
 The Truth from Thee,
 Rain down on as a shower
 Of stones from the sky,
 Or send us a grievous Penalty.

33. But God was not going
 To send them a Penalty
 Whilst thou wast amongst them;
 Nor was He going to send it
 Whilst they could ask for pardon

34. But what plea have they
 That God should not punish
 Them, when they keep out
 (Men) from the Sacred Mosque--
 And they are not its guardians?
 No men can be its guardians
 Except the righteous; but most
 Of them do not understand.

35. Their prayer at the House
 (Of God) is nothing but
 Whistling and clapping of hands:
 (Its only answer can be),
 "Taste ye the Penalty
 Because ye blasphemed."

36. The Unbelievers spend their wealth
 To hinder (men) from the path
 Of God, and so will they
 Continue to spend; but
 In the end they will have
 (Only) regrets and sighs;

At length they will be overcome:
 And the Unbelievers will be
 Gathered together to Hell;--

37. In order that God may separate
 The impure from the pure,
 Put the impure, one on another,
 Heap them together, and cast them
 Into Hell. They will be
 The ones to have lost.

  

SECTION 5.

38. Say to the Unbelievers,
 If (now) they desist (from Unbelief),
 Their past would be forgiven them;
 But if they persist, the punishment
 Of those before them is already
 (A matter of warning for them).

39. And fight them on
 Until there is no 
 Tumult or oppression,
 And there prevail
 Justice and faith in God
 Altogether and everywhere;
 But if they cease, verily God
 Doth see all that they do.

40. If they refuse, be sure
 That God is your Protector--
 The Best to protect
 And the Best to help.

41. And know that out of
 All the booty that ye
 May acquire (in war),
 A fifth share is assigned
 To God,--and to the Apostle,
 And to near relatives,
 Orphans, the needy,
 And the wayfarer,
 If ye do believe in God
 And in the revelation
 We sent down to Our Servant
 On the Day of Testing,--
 The Day of the meeting
 Of the two forces.
 For God hath power
 Over all things.

42. Remember ye were
 On the hither side
 Of the valley, and they
 On the farther side,
 And the caravan
 On lower ground than ye.
 Even if ye had made
 A mutual appointment
 To meet, ye would certainly:
 Have failed in the appointment:

But (thus ye met),
 That God might accomplish
 A matter already enacted;
 That those who died might
 Die after a clear Sign
 (Had been given), and those who lived
 Might live after a Clear Sign
 (Had been given). And verily
 God is He who heareth
 And knoweth (all things).

43. Remember in thy dream
 God showed them to thee
 As few: if He had shown
 Them to thee as many,
 Ye would surely have been
 Discouraged, and ye would
 Surely have disputed
 In (your) decision: but God
 Saved (you): for He knoweth
 Well the (secrets) of (all) hearts.

44. And remember when ye met,
 He showed them to you
 As few in your eyes,
 And He made you appear
 As contemptible in their eyes:
 That God might accomplish
 A matter already enacted.
 For to God do all questions
 Go back (for decision).

  

SECTION 6.

45. O ye who believe!
 When ye meet a force,
 Be firm, and call God
 In remembrance much (and often);
 That ye may prosper:

46. And obey God and His Apostle;
 And fall into no disputes,

Lest ye lose heart
 And your power depart;
 And be patient and persevering:
 For God is with those
 Who patiently persevere:

47. And be not like those
 Who started from their homes
 Insolently and to be seen of men,
 And to hinder (men)
 From the path of God:
 For God compasseth round about
 All that they do.

48. Remember Satan made
 Their (sinful) acts seem
 Alluring to them, and said:
 "No one among men
 Can overcome you this day,
 While I am near to you":
 But when the two forces
 Came in sight of each other,
 He turned on his heels,
 And said: "Lo! I am clear
 Of you; to! I see
 What ye see not;
 Lo! I fear God; for God
 Is strict in punishment.

  

SECTION 7.

49. Lo! the Hypocrites say, and those
 In whose hearts is a disease:
 "These people,--their religion
 Has misled them." But
 If any trust in God, behold!
 God is Exalted in might, Wise.

50. If thou couldst see,
 When the angels take the souls
 Of the Unbelievers (at death),
 (How) they smite their faces
 And their backs, (saying):
 "Taste the Penalty of the blazing Fire--

51. "Because of (the deeds) which
 Your (own) hands sent forth:
 For God is never unjust
 To His servants:

52. "(Deeds) after the manner
 Of the People of Pharaoh
 And of those before them:
 They rejected the Signs of God,
 And God punished them
 For their crimes: for God
 Is Strong, and Strict in punishment:

53. "Because God will never change
 The Grace which He hath bestowed
 On a people until they change
 What is in their (own) souls:
 And verily God is He
 Who heareth and knoweth (all things)."

54. "(Deeds) after the manner
 Of the People of Pharaoh
 And those before them":
 They treated as false the Signs
 Of their Lord: so We

Destroyed them for their crimes,
 And We drowned the People
 Of Pharaoh: for they were all
 Oppressors and wrong-doers.

55. For the worst of beasts
 In the sight of God
 Are those who reject Him:
 They will not believe.

56. They are those with whom
 Thou didst make a covenant,
 But they break their covenant
 Every time, and they have not
 The fear (of God).

57. If ye gain the mastery
 Over them in war,
 Disperse, with them, those
 Who follow them,
 That they may remember.

58. If thou fearest treachery
 From any group, throw back
 (Their Covenant) to them, (so as
 To be) on equal terms:
 For God loveth not the treacherous.

  

SECTION 8.

59. Let not the Unbelievers
 Think that they can
 Get the better (of the godly):
 They will never frustrate (them).

60. Against them make ready
 Your strength to the utmost
 Of your power, including
 Steeds of war, to strike terror
 Into (the hearts of) the enemies,
 Of God and your enemies,
 And others besides, whom
 Ye may not know, but whom
 God doth know. Whatever
 Ye shall spend in the Cause
 Of God, shall be repaid
 Unto you, and ye shall not
 Be treated unjustly.

61. But if the enemy
 Incline towards peace,
 Do thou (also) incline
 Towards peace, and trust
 In God: for He is the One
 That heareth and knoweth
 (All things).

62. Should they intend
 To deceive thee,--verily God
 Sufficeth thee: He it is
 That hath strengthened thee
 With his aid and
 With (the company of)
 The Believers;

63. And (moreover) He hath put
 Affection between their hearts:

Not if thou hadst spent
 All that is in the earth,
 Couldst thou have produced
 That affection, but God
 Hath done it: for He
 Is Exalted in might, Wise.

64. O Apostle! Sufficient
 Unto thee is God,--
 (Unto thee) and unto those
 Who follow thee
 Among the Believers.

  

SECTION 9.

65. O Apostle! rouse the Believers
 To the fight. If there are
 Twenty amongst you, patient
 And persevering, they will
 Vanquish two hundred: if a hundred,
 They will vanquish a thousand
 Of the Unbelievers: for these
 Are a people without understanding.

66. For the present, God
 Hath lightened your (task),
 For He knoweth that there is
 A weak spot in you:
 But (even so), if there are
 A hundred of you, patient
 And persevering, they will
 Vanquish two hundred, and if
 A thousand, they will vanquish
 Two thousand, with the leave
 Of God: for God is with those
 Who patiently persevere.

67. It is not fitting
 For an Apostle
 That he should have
 Prisoners of war until
 He hath thoroughly subdued
 The land. Ye look
 For the temporal goods
 Of this world; but God
 Looketh to the Hereafter:
 And God is Exalted in might, Wise.

68. Had it not been for
 A previous ordainment

From God, a severe penalty
 Would have reached you
 For the (ransom) that ye took.

69. But (now) enjoy what ye took
 In war, lawful and good:
 But fear God: for God
 Is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.

  

SECTION 10.

70. O Apostle! say to those
 Who are captives in your hands:
 "If God findeth any good
 In your hearts, He will
 Give you something better
 Than what has been taken
 From you, and He will
 Forgive you: for God
 Is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful."

71. But if they have
 Treacherous designs against thee,
 (O Apostle!), they have already
 Been in treason against God,
 And so hath He given
 (Thee) power over them.
 And God is He who hath
 (Full) knowledge and wisdom.

72. Those who believed,
 And adopted exile,

And fought for the Faith,
 With their property
 And their persons,
 In the cause of God,
 As well as those
 Who gave (them) asylum
 And aid,--these are (all)
 Friends and protectors,
 One of another.
 As to those who believed
 But came not into exile,
 Ye owe no duty
 Of protection to them
 Until they come into exile;
 But if they seek
 Your aid in religion,
 It is your duty
 To help them,
 Except against a people
 With whom ye have
 A treaty of mutual alliance.
 And (remember) God
 Seeth all that ye do.

73. The Unbelievers are
 Protectors, one of another:
 Unless ye do this,
 (Protect each other),
 There would be
 Tumult and oppression
 On earth, and great mischief.

74. Those who believe,
 And adopt exile,
 And tight for the Faith,
 In the cause of God,
 As well as those
 Who give (them) asylum
 And aid,--these are (all)
 In very truth the Believers:
 For them is the forgiveness
 Of sins and a provision
 Most generous.

75. And those who
 Accept Faith subsequently,
 And adopt exile,
 And fight for the Faith
 In your company,
 They are of you.
 But kindred by blood
 Have prior rights
 Against each other
 In the Book of God.
 Verily God is well-acquainted
 With all things.



  

Sura IX.

  

Tauba (Repentance) or Baraat (Immunity).

1. A (declaration) of immunity
 From God and His Apostle,
 To those of the Pagans
 With whom ye have contracted
 Mutual alliances:--

2. Go ye, then, for four months,
 Backwards and forwards,
 (As ye will), throughout the land,
 But know ye that ye cannot
 Frustrate God (lay your falsehood)
 But that God will cover
 With shame those who reject Him.

3. And an announcement from God
 And His Apostle, to the people
 (Assembled) on the day
 Of the Great Pilgrimage,--
 That God and His Apostle
 Dissolve (treaty) obligations
 With the Pagans.
 If, then, ye repent,
 It were best for you;
 But if ye turn away,

Know ye that ye cannot
 Frustrate God. And proclaim
 A grievous penalty to those
 Who reject Faith.

4. (But the treaties are)not dissolved
 With those Pagans with whom
 Ye have entered into alliance
 And who have not subsequently
 Failed you in aught,
 Nor aided any one against you.
 So fulfil your engagements
 With them to the end
 Of their term: for God
 Loveth the righteous.

5. But when the forbidden months
 Are past, then fight and slay
 The Pagans wherever ye find them,
 And seize them, beleaguer them,
 And lie in wait for them
 In every stratagem (of war);
 But if they repent,
 And establish regular prayers
 And practise regular charity,
 Then open the way for them:
 For God is Oft-forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

6. If one amongst the Pagans
 Ask thee for asylum,
 Grant it to him,
 So that he may hear the Word
 Of God; and then escort him
 To where he can be secure.
 That is because they are
 Men without knowledge.

  

SECTION 2.

7. How can there be a league,
 Before God and His Apostle,
 With the Pagans, except those
 With whom ye made a treaty
 Near the Sacred Mosque?
 As long as these stand true
 To you, stand ye true to them:
 For God doth love the righteous.

8. How (can there be such a league),
 Seeing that if they get an advantage
 Over you, they respect not
 In you the ties either of kinship

Or of covenant? With (fair words
 From) their mouths they entice you,
 But their hearts are averse
 From you; and most of them
 Are rebellious and wicked.

9. The Signs of God have they sold
 For a miserable price,
 And (many) have they hindered
 From His Way: evil indeed
 Are the deeds they have done.

10. In a Believer they respect not
 The ties either of kinship
 Or of covenant! It is they
 Who have transgressed all bounds.

11. But (even so), if they repent,
 Establish regular prayers,
 And practise regular charity,--
 They are your brethren in Faith:
 (Thus) do We explain the Signs
 in detail, for those who understand.

12. But if they violate their oaths
 After their covenant,
 And taunt you for your Faith,--
 Fight ye the chiefs of Unfaith:
 For their oaths are nothing to them:
 That thus they may be restrained.

13. Will ye not fight people
 Who violated their oaths,

Plotted to expel the Apostle,
 And took the aggressive
 By being the first (to assault) you?
 Do ye fear them? Nay,
 It is God Whom ye should
 More justly fear, if ye believe!

14. Fight them, and God will
 Punish them by your hands,
 Cover them with shame,
 Help you (to victory) over them,
 Heal the breasts of Believers,

15. And still the indignation of their hearts!
 For God will turn (in mercy)
 To whom He will; and God
 Is All-Knowing, All-Wise.

16. Or think ye that ye
 Shall be abandoned,
 As though God did not know'
 Those among you who strive
 With might and main, and take
 None for friends and protectors
 Except God, His Apostle,
 And the (community of) Believers?
 But God is well-acquainted
 With (all) that ye do.

  

SECTION 3.

17. It is not for such
 As join gods with God,
 To visit or maintain
 The mosques of God
 While they witness
 Against their own souls
 To infidelity. The works
 Of such bear no fruit:
 In Fire shall they dwell.

18. The mosques of God
 Shall be visited and maintained
 By such as believe in God
 And the Last Day, establish
 Regular prayers, and practise
 Regular charity, and fear
 None (at all) except God.
 It is they who are expected
 To be on true guidance!

19. Do ye make the giving
 Of drink to pilgrims,

Or the maintenance of
 The Sacred Mosque, equal
 To (the pious service of) those
 Who believe in God
 And the Last Day, and strive
 With might and main
 In the cause of God?
 They are not comparable
 In the sight of God:
 And God guides not
 Those who do wrong.

20. Those who believe, and suffer
 Exile and strive with might
 And main, in God's cause,
 With their goods and their persons,
 Have the highest rank
 In the sight of God:
 They are the people
 Who will achieve (salvation).

21. Their Lord doth give them
 Glad tidings of a Mercy
 From Himself, of His good pleasure,
 And of Gardens for them,
 Wherein are delights
 That endure:

22. They will dwell therein
 For ever. Verily in God's presence
 Is a reward, the greatest (of all).

23. O ye who believe! Take not
 For protectors your fathers
 And your brothers if they love
 Infidelity above Faith:

If any of you do so,
 They do wrong.

24. Say; If it be that your fathers,
 Your sons, your brothers,
 Your mates, or your kindred;
 The wealth that ye have gained;
 The commerce in which ye fear
 A decline: or the dwellings
 In which ye delight--
 Are dearer to you than God,
 Or His Apostle, or the striving
 In His cause;--then wait
 Until God brings about
 His Decision: and God
 Guides not the rebellious.

  

SECTION 4.

25. Assuredly God did help you
 In many battle-fields
 And on the day of Hunain:
 Behold! your great numbers
 Elated you, but they availed
 You naught: the land,
 For all that it is wide,
 Did. constrain you, and ye

Turned back in retreat.

26. But God did pour His calm
 On the Apostle and on the Believers,
 And sent down forces which ye
 Saw not: He punished
 The Unbelievers: thus doth He
 Reward those without Faith.

27. Again will God, after this,
 Turn (in mercy) to whom
 He will: for God
 Is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.

28. O ye who believe! Truly
 The Pagans are unclean;
 So let them not,
 After this year of theirs,

Approach the Sacred Mosque.
 And if ye fear poverty,
 Soon will God enrich you,
 If He wills, out of His bounty,
 For God is All-Knowing, All-Wise.

29. Fight those who believe not
 In God nor the Last Day,
 Nor hold that forbidden
 Which hath been forbidden
 By God and His Apostle,
 Nor acknowledge the Religion
 Of Truth, (even if they are)
 Of the People of the Book,
 Until they pay the Jizya
 With willing submission,
 And feel themselves subdued.

  

SECTION 5.

30. The Jews call 'Uzair a son
 Of God, and the Christians
 Call Christ the Son of God.
 That is a saying from their mouth;
 (In this) they but imitate
 What the Unbelievers of old
 Used to say. God's curse
 Be on them: how they are deluded
 Away from the Truth!

31. They take their priests
 And their anchorites to be
 Their lords in derogation of God,
 And (they take as their Lord)
 Christ the son of Mary;
 Yet they were commanded
 To worship but One God:
 There is no god but He.
 Praise and glory to Him
 (Far is He) from having
 The partners they associate
 (With Him).

32. Fain would they extinguish
 God's Light with their mouths,
 But God will not allow
 But that His Light should be
 Perfected, even though the Unbelievers
 May detest (it).

33. It is He Who hath sent
 His Apostle with Guidance
 And the Religion of Truth,
 To proclaim it
 Over all religion,
 Even though the Pagans
 May detest (it).

34. O ye who believe! There are
 Indeed many among the priests
 And anchorites, who in falsehood
 Devour the substance of men
 And hinder (them) from the Way
 Of God. And there are those
 Who bury gold and silver
 And spend it not in the Way.
 Of God: announce unto them
 A most grievous penalty--

35. On the Day when heat
 Will be produced out of
 That (wealth) in the fire
 Of Hell, and with it will be
 Branded their foreheads,
 Their flanks, and their backs.
 --"This is the (treasure) which ye
 Buried for yourselves: taste ye,
 Then, the (treasures) ye buried!"

36. The number of months
 In the sight of God
 Is twelve (in a year)
 So ordained by Him
 The day He created
 The heavens and the earth;
 Of them four are sacred:
 That is the straight usage.
 So wrong not yourselves
 Therein, and fight the Pagans

All together as they
 Fight you all together.
 But know that God
 Is with those who restrain
 Themselves.

37. Verily the transposing
 (Of a prohibited month)
 Is an addition to Unbelief:
 The Unbelievers are led
 To wrong thereby: for they make
 It lawful one year,
 And forbidden another year,
 In order to adjust the number
 Of months forbidden by God
 And make such forbidden ones
 Lawful. The evil of their course
 Seems pleasing to them.
 But God guideth not
 Those who reject Faith.

  

SECTION 6.

38. O ye who believe! what
 Is the matter with you,
 That, when ye are asked
 To go forth in the Cause of God,
 Ye cling heavily to the earth?
 Do ye prefer the life
 Of this world to the Hereafter?
 But little is the comfort
 Of this life, as compared
 With the Hereafter.

39. Unless ye go forth,
 He will punish you
 With a grievous penalty,
 And put others in your place;
 But Him ye would not harm
 In the least. For God
 Hath power over all things.

40. If ye help not (your Leader),
 (it is no matter): for God
 Did indeed help him,
 When the Unbelievers
 Drove him out: he had
 No more than one companion:
 They two were in the Cave,
 And he said to his companion,
 "Have no fear, for God
 Is with us": then God
 Sent down His peace upon him,
 And strengthened him with forces
 Which ye saw not, and humbled
 To the depths the word
 Of the Unbelievers.
 But the word of God
 Is exalted to the heights:
 For God is Exalted in might, Wise

41. Go ye forth, (whether equipped)
 Lightly or heavily, and strive
 And struggle, with your goods
 And your persons, in the Cause
 Of God. That is best
 For you, if ye (but) knew.

42. If there had been
 Immediate gain (in sight),
 And the journey easy,
 They would (all) without doubt
 Have followed thee, but
 The distance was long,
 (And weighed) on them.
 They would indeed swear
 By God, "If we only could,
 We should certainly
 Have come out with you:"
 They would destroy their own souls; 
 For God doth know
 That they are certainly lying.

  

SECTION 7.

43. God give thee grace! Why
 Didst thou grant them exemption
 Until those who told the truth
 Were seen by thee in a clear light,
 And thou hadst proved the liars?

44. Those who believe in God
 And the Last Day ask thee
 For no exemption from fighting
 With their goods and persons.
 And God knoweth well
 Those who do their duty.

45. Only those ask thee for exemption
 Who believe not in God
 And the Last Day, and
 Whose hearts are in doubt,
 So that they are tossed
 In their doubts to and fro.

46. If they had intended
 To come out, they would
 Certainly have made
 Some preparation therefor;
 But God was averse
 To their being sent forth;
 So He made them lag behind,
 And they were told,
 "Sit ye among those
 Who sit (inactive)."

47. If they had come out
 With you, they would not

Have added to your (strength)
 But only (made for) disorder,
 Hurrying to and fro in your midst
 And sowing sedition among you,
 And there would have been
 Some among you
 Who would have listened to them.
 But God knoweth well
 Those who do wrong.

48. Indeed they had plotted
 Sedition before, and upset
 Matters for thee,--until
 The Truth arrived, and the Decree
 Of God became manifest,
 Much to their disgust.

49. Among them is (many) a man
 Who says: "Grant me exemption
 And draw me not.
 Into trial." Have they not
 Fallen into trial already?
 And indeed Hell surrounds
 The Unbelievers (on all sides).

50. If good befalls thee,
 It grieves them; but if
 A misfortune befalls thee,
 They say, "We took indeed
 Our precautions beforehand,"
 And they turn away rejoicing.

51. Say: "Nothing will happen to us
 Except what God has decreed
 For us: He is our Protector":
 And on God let the Believers
 Put their trust.

52. Say: "Can you expect for us
 (Any fate) other than one
 Of two glorious things--
 (Martyrdom or victory)?
 But we can expect for you
 Either that God will send
 His punishment from Himself,
 Or by our hands. So wait
 (Expectant); we too
 Will wait with you."

53. Say: "Spend (for the Cause)
 Willingly or unwillingly:
 Not from you will it be
 Accepted: for ye are indeed
 A people rebellious and wicked."

54. The only reasons why
 Their contributions are not
 Accepted are: that they reject
 God and His Apostle;
 That they come to prayer
 Without earnestness; and that
 They offer contributions unwillingly.

55. Let not their wealth rats
 Nor their (following in) sons

Dazzle thee: in reality
 God's Plan is to punish them
 With these things in this life,
 And that their souls may perish
 In their (very) denial of God.

56. They swear by God
 That they are indeed
 Of you; but they are not
 Of you: yet they are afraid
 (To appear in their true colours).

57. If they could find
 A place to flee to,
 Or caves, or a place
 Of concealment, they would
 Turn straightway thereto,
 With an obstinate rush.

58. And among them are men
 Who slander thee in the matter
 Of (the distribution of) the alms:
 If they are given part thereof,
 They are pleased, but if not,
 Behold! they are indignant!

59. If only they had been content
 With what God and His Apostle
 Gave them, and had said,
 "Sufficient unto us is God!
 God and His Apostle will soon
 Give us of His bounty:
 To God do we turn our hopes!"
 (That would have been the right course).

  

SECTION 8.

60. Alms are for the poor
 And the needy, and those
 Employed to administer the (funds);
 For those whose hearts
 Have been (recently) reconciled
 (To Truth); for those in bondage
 And in debt; in the cause
 Of God; and for the wayfarer:
 (Thus is it) ordained by God,
 And God is full of knowledge
 And wisdom.

61. Among them are men
 Who molest the Prophet
 And say, "He is (all) ear."
 Say, "He listens to what is
 Best for you: he believes
 In God, has faith
 In the Believers, and is a Mercy
 To those of you who believe."
 But those who molest the Apostle
 Will have a grievous penalty.

62. To you they swear by God.
 In order to please you:
 But it is more fitting
 That they should please
 God and His Apostle,
 If they are Believers.

63. Know they not that for those
 Who oppose God and His Apostle,
 Is the Fire of Hell?--
 Wherein they shall dwell.
 That is the supreme disgrace.

64. The Hypocrites are afraid
 Lest a Sura should be sent down
 About them, showing them what
 Is (really passing) in their hearts.
 Say: "Mock ye! But verily
 God will bring to light all
 That ye fear (should be revealed).

65. If thou dost question them,
 They declare (with emphasis):
 "We were only talking idly
 And in play." Say: "Was it
 At God, and His Signs,
 And His Apostle, that ye
 Were mocking?"

66. Make ye no excuses:
 Ye have rejected Faith
 After ye had accepted it.
 If We pardon some of you,
 We will punish others amongst you,
 For that they are in sin.

  

SECTION 9.

67. The Hypocrites, men and women,
 (Have an understanding) with each other:

They enjoin evil, and forbid
 What is just, and are close
 With their hands. They have
 Forgotten God; so He
 Hath forgotten them. Verily
 The Hypocrites are rebellious
 And perverse.

68. God hath promised the Hypocrites
 Men and women, and the rejecters,
 Of Faith, the fire of Hell:
 Therein shall they dwell:
 Sufficient is it for them:
 For them is the curse of God,
 And an enduring punishment,--

69. As in the case of those
 Before you: they were
 Mightier than you in power,
 And more flourishing in wealth
 And children. They had
 Their enjoyment of their portion:
 And ye have of yours, as did
 Those before you; and ye
 Indulge in idle talk
 As they did. They!--
 Their works are fruitless
 In this world and in the Hereafter,
 And they will lose
 (All spiritual good).

70. Hath not the story reached them
 Of those before them?--
 The people of Noah, and 'Ad,
 And Thamud; the people

Of Abraham, the men
 Of Midian, and the Cities overthrown.
 To them came their apostles
 With Clear Signs. It is
 Not God Who wrongs them,
 But they wrong their own souls.

71. The Believers, men
 And women, are protectors,
 One of another: they enjoin
 What is just, and forbid
 What is evil: they observe
 Regular prayers, practise
 Regular charity, and obey
 God and His Apostle.
 On them will God pour
 His mercy: for God
 Is Exalted in power, Wise:

72. God hath promised to Believers,
 Men and women, Gardens
 Under which rivers flow,
 To dwell therein,
 And beautiful mansions
 In Gardens of everlasting bliss.
 But the greatest bliss
 Is the Good Pleasure of God:
 That is the supreme felicity.

  

SECTION 10.

73. O Prophet! strive hard against
 The Unbelievers and the Hypocrites,
 And be firm against them.
 Their abode is Hell,--
 An evil refuge indeed.

74. They swear by God that they
 Said nothing (evil), but indeed
 They uttered blasphemy,
 And they did it after accepting
 Islam; and they meditated
 A plot which they were unable
 To carry out: this revenge
 Of theirs was (their) only return
 For the bounty with which
 God and His Apostle had enriched
 Them! If they repent,
 It will be best for them;
 But if they turn back
 (To their evil ways),
 God will punish them
 With a grievous penalty
 In this life and in the Hereafter:
 They shall have none on earth
 To protect or help them.

75. Amongst them are men
 Who made a Covenant with God,
 That if He bestowed on them
 Of His bounty, they would give
 (Largely) in charity, and be truly
 Amongst those who are righteous.

76. But when He did bestow
 Of His bounty, they became
 Covetous, and turned back
 (From their Covenant), averse
 (From its fulfilment).

77. So He hath put as a consequence
 Hypocrisy into their hearts,
 (To last) till the Day whereon
 They shall meet Him: because
 They broke their Covenant
 With God, and because they
 Lied (again and again).

78. Know they not that God
 Doth know their secret (thoughts)
 And their secret counsels,
 And that God knoweth well
 All things unseen?

79. Those who slander such
 Of the Believers as give themselves
 Freely to (deeds of) charity,
 As well as such as can find
 Nothing to give except
 The fruits of their labour,--
 And throw ridicule on them,--
 God will throw back

Their ridicule on them:
 And they shall have
 A grievous penalty.

80. Whether thou ask
 For their forgiveness,
 Or not, (their sin is unforgivable):
 If thou ask seventy times
 For their forgiveness, God
 Will not forgive them:
 Because they have rejected
 God and His Apostle: and God
 Guideth not those
 Who are perversely rebellious.

  

SECTION 11.

81. Those who were left behind
 (In the Tabuk expedition)
 Rejoiced in their inaction
 Behind the back of the Apostle
 Of God: they hated to strive
 And fight, with their goods
 And their persons, in the Cause
 Of God: they said,
 "Go not forth in the heat."
 Say, "The fire of Hell
 Is fiercer in heat." If
 Only they could understand!

82. Let them laugh a little:
 Much will they weep:

A recompense for the (evil)
 That they do.

83. If, then, God bring thee back
 To any of them, and they ask
 Thy permission to come out
 (With thee), say: "Never shall ye
 Come out with me, nor fight
 An enemy with me:
 For ye preferred to sit
 Inactive on the first occasion:
 Then sit ye (now)
 With those who lag behind."

84. Nor do thou ever pray
 For any of them that dies,
 Nor stand at his grave;
 For they rejected God
 And His Apostle, and died
 In a state of perverse rebellion.

85. Nor let their wealth
 Nor their (following in) sons
 Dazzle thee: God's Plan
 Is to punish them
 With these things in this world,
 And that their souls may perish
 In their (very) denial of God.

86. When a Sura comes down,
 Enjoining them to believe
 In God and to strive and fight
 Along with His Apostle,
 Those with wealth and influence
 Among them ask thee
 For exemption, and say:
 "Leave us (behind): we
 Would be with those
 Who sit (at home)."

87. They prefer to be with (the women),
 Who remain behind (at home):
 Their hearts are sealed
 And so they understand not.

88. But the Apostle, and those
 Who believe with him,
 Strive and fight with their wealth
 And their persons: for them
 Are (all) good things:
 And it is they
 Who will prosper.

89. God hath prepared for them
 Gardens under which rivers flow,

To dwell therein:
 That is the supreme felicity.

  

SECTION 12.

90. And there were, among
 The desert Arabs (also),
 Men who made excuses
 And came to claim exemption;
 And those who were false
 To God and His Apostle
 (Merely) sat inactive.
 Soon will a grievous penalty
 Seize the Unbelievers
 Among them.

91. There is no blame
 On those who are infirm,

Or ill, or who find
 No resources to spend
 (On the Cause), if they
 Are sincere (in duty) to God
 And His Apostle:
 No ground (of complaint)
 Can there be against such
 As do right: and God
 Is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

92. Nor (is there blame)
 On those who came to thee
 To be provided with mounts,
 And when thou saidst,
 "I can find no mounts
 For you, "they turned back,
 Their eyes streaming with tears
 Of grief that they had
 No resources wherewith
 To provide the expenses.

93. The ground (of complaint)
 Is against such as claim
 Exemption while they are rich.
 They prefer to stay
 With the (women) who remain
 Behind: God hath sealed
 Their hearts; so they know not
 (What they miss).

94. They will present their excuses
 To you when ye return
 To them. Say thou: "Present
 No excuses: we shall not
 Believe you: God hath already
 Informed us of the true state
 Of matters concerning you:
 It is your actions that God
 And His Apostle will observe:
 In the end will ye
 Be brought back to Him
 Who knoweth what is hidden
 And what is open:
 Then will He show you
 The truth of all
 That ye did."

95. They will swear to you by God,
 When ye return to them,
 That ye may leave them alone.
 So leave them alone:
 For they are an abomination,
 And Hell is their dwelling-place,--
 A fitting recompense
 For the (evil) that they did.

96. They will swear unto you,
 That ye may be pleased with them,
 But if ye are pleased with them,
 God is not pleased
 With those who disobey.

97. The Arabs of the desert
 Are the worst in unbelief
 And hypocrisy, and most fitted
 To be in ignorance
 Of the command which God
 Hath sent down to His Apostle:
 But God is All-Knowing,
 All-Wise.

98. Some of the desert Arabs
 Look upon their payments

As a fine, and watch
 For disasters for you: on them
 Be the disaster of Evil:
 For God is He that heareth
 And knoweth (all things).

99. But some of the desert Arabs
 Believe in God and the Last Day,
 And look on their payments
 As pious gifts bringing them
 Nearer to God and obtaining
 The prayers of the Apostle.
 Aye, indeed they bring them
 Nearer (to Him): soon will God
 Admit them to His Mercy:
 For God is Oft-Forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

  

SECTION 13.

100. The vanguard (of Islam)--
 The first of those who forsook
 (Their homes) and of those
 Who gave them aid, and (also)
 Those who follow them
 In (all) good deeds,--
 Well-pleased is God with them,
 As are they with Him:

For them hath He prepared
 Gardens under which rivers flow,
 To dwell therein for ever:
 That is the supreme Felicity.

101. Certain of the desert Arabs
 Round about you are Hypocrites,
 As well as (desert Arabs) among
 The Medina folk: they are
 Obstinate in hypocrisy: thou
 Knowest them not: We know them:
 Twice shall We punish them:
 And in addition shall they be
 Sent to a grievous Penalty.

102. Others (there are who) have
 Acknowledged their wrong-doings:
 They have mixed an act
 That was good with another
 That was evil. Perhaps God
 Will turn unto them (in mercy):
 For God is Oft-Forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

103. Of their goods take alms,
 That so thou mightest
 Purify and sanctify them;
 And pray on their behalf.
 Verily thy prayers are a source
 Of security for them:
 And God is One
 Who heareth and knoweth.

104. Know they not that God
 Doth accept repentance from
 His votaries and receives
 Their gifts of charity, and that
 God is verily He,
 The Oft-Returning, Most Merciful?

105. And say: "Work (righteousness):
 Soon will God observe your work,
 And His Apostle, and the Believers:
 Soon will ye be brought back
 To the Knower of what is
 Hidden and what is open:
 Then will He show you
 The truth of all that ye did."

106. There are (yet) others,
 Held in suspense for the command
 Of God, whether He will
 Punish them, or turn in mercy
 To them: and God
 Is All-Knowing, Wise.

107. And there are those
 Who put up a mosque

By way of mischief and infidelity--
 To disunite the Believers
 And in preparation for one
 Who warred against God
 And His Apostle aforetime.
 They will indeed swear
 That their intention is nothing
 But good; but God doth declare
 That they are certainly liars.

108. Never stand thou forth therein.
 There is a mosque whose foundation
 Was laid from the first day
 On piety; it is more worthy
 Of thy standing forth (for prayer)
 Therein. In it are men who
 Love to be purified; and God
 Loveth those who make themselves pure.

109. Which then is best?--he that
 Layeth his foundation
 On piety to God
 And His Good Pleasure?--or he
 That layeth his foundation
 On an undermined sand-cliff
 Ready to crumble to pieces?
 And it doth crumble to pieces
 With him, into the fire
 Of Hell. And God guideth not
 People that do wrong.

110. The foundation of those
 Who so build is never free

From suspicion and shakiness
 In their hearts, until
 Their hearts are cut to pieces.
 And God is All-Knowing, Wise.

  

SECTION 14.

111. God hath purchased of the Believers
 Their persons and their goods;
 For theirs (in return)
 Is the Garden (of Paradise):
 They fight in His Cause,
 And slay and are slain:
 A promise binding on Him
 In Truth, through the Law,
 The Gospel, and the Qur-an:
 And who is more faithful
 To his Covenant than God?
 Then rejoice in the bargain
 Which ye have concluded:
 That is the achievement supreme.

112. Those that turn (to God)
 In repentance; that serve Him,
 And praise Him; that wander
 In devotion to the Cause of God;
 That bow down and prostrate themselves
 In prayer; that enjoin good
 And forbid evil; and observe
 The limits set by God;--
 (These do rejoice). So proclaim
 The glad tidings to the Believers.

113. It is not fitting,
 For the Prophet and those
 Who believe, that they should
 Pray for forgiveness
 For Pagans, even though
 They be of kin, after it is
 Clear to them that they
 Are companions of the Fire.

114. And Abraham prayed
 For his father's forgiveness
 Only because of a promise
 He had made to him.
 But when it became clear
 To him that he was
 An enemy to God, he
 Dissociated himself from him:
 For Abraham was most
 Tender-hearted, forbearing.

115. And God will not mislead
 A people after He hath

Guided them, in order that
 He may make clear to them
 What to fear (and avoid)--
 For God hath knowledge
 Of all things.

116. Unto God belongeth
 The dominion of the heavens
 And the earth. He giveth life
 And He taketh it. Except for Him
 Ye have no protector
 Nor helper.

117. God turned with favour
 To the Prophet, the Muhajirs,
 And the Ansar,--who followed
 Him in a time of distress,
 After that the hearts of a part
 Of them had nearly swerved
 (From duty); but He turned
 To them (also): for He is
 Unto them Most Kind,
 Most Merciful.

118. (He turned in mercy also)
 To the three who were left
 Behind; (they felt guilty)
 To such a degree that the earth

Seemed constrained to them,
 For all its speciousness,
 And their (very) Souls seemed
 Straitened to them,
 And they perceived that
 There is no fleeing from God
 (And no refuge) but to Himself.
 Then He turned to them,
 That they might repent:
 For God is Oft-Returning,
 Most Merciful.

  

SECTION 15.

119. O ye who believe! Fear God
 And be with those
 Who are true (in word and deed).

120. It was not fitting
 For the people of Medina
 And the Bedouin Arabs
 Of the neighbourhood, to refuse
 To follow God's Apostle,
 Nor to prefer their own lives
 To his: because nothing
 Could they suffer or do,
 But was reckoned to their credit
 As a deed of righteousness,--
 Whether they suffered thirst,
 Or fatigue, or hunger, in the Cause
 Of God, or trod paths
 To raise the ire of the Unbelievers,
 Or received any injury

Whatever from an enemy:
 For God suffereth not
 The reward to be lost
 Of those who do good;--

121. Nor could they spend anything
 (For the Cause)--small or great--
 Nor cut across a valley,
 But the deed is inscribed
 To their credit; that God
 May requite their deed
 With the best (possible reward).

122. Nor should the Believers
 All go forth together:
 If a contingent
 From every expedition
 Remained behind,
 They could devote themselves
 To studies in religion,
 And admonish the people
 When they return to them,--
 That thus they (may learn)
 To guard themselves (against evil)

  

SECTION 16.

123. O ye who believe! Fight
 The Unbelievers who gird you about,
 And let them find firmness
 In you: and know that God
 Is with those who fear Him.

124. Whenever there cometh down'
 A Sura, some of them say:
 "Which of you has had
 His faith increased by it?"
 Yea, those who believe,--
 Their faith is increased,
 And they do rejoice.

125. But those in whose hearts
 Is a disease,--it will add doubt
 To their doubt, and they will die
 In a state of Unbelief.

126. See they not that they
 Are tried every year
 Once or twice? Yet they
 Turn not in repentance,
 And they take no heed.

127. Whenever there cometh down
 A Sura, they look at each other,
 (Saying), "Doth anyone see you?"
 Then they turn aside:
 God hath turned their hearts
 (From the light); for they
 Are a people that understand not.

128. Now hath come unto you
 An Apostle from amongst

Yourselves: it grieves him
 That ye should perish:
 Ardently anxious is he
 Over you: to the Believers
 Is he most kind and merciful.

129. But if they turn away,
 Say: "God sufficeth me:
 There is no god but He:
 On Him is my trust,
 He the Lord of the Throne
 (Of Glory) Supreme!



  

Sura X.

  

Yunus, or Jonah.



1. A. L. R.
 These are the Ayats
 Of the Book of Wisdom.

2. Is it a matter
 Of wonderment to men
 That We have sent
 Our inspiration to a man
 From among themselves?--
 That he should warn mankind
 (Of their danger), and give
 The good news to the Believers
 That they have before their Lord
 The lofty rank of Truth.
 (But) say the Unbelievers:
 "This is indeed
 An evident sorcerer!"

3. Verily your Lord is God,
 Who created the heavens
 And the earth in six Days,

And is firmly established
 On the Throne (of authority),
 Regulating and governing all things.
 No intercessor (can plead with Him)
 Except after His leave
 (Hath been obtained). This
 Is God your Lord; Him therefore
 Serve ye: will ye not
 Receive admonition?

4. To Him will be your return--
 Of all of you. The promise
 Of God is true and sure.
 It is He who beginneth
 The process of creation,
 And repeateth it, that He
 May reward with justice
 Those who believe
 And work righteousness;
 But those who reject Him
 Will have draughts
 Of boiling fluids,
 And a Penalty grievous,
 Because they did reject Him.

5. It is He who made the sun
 To be a shining glory

And the moon to be a light
 (Of beauty), and measured out
 Stages for her; that ye might
 Know the number of years
 And the count (of time).
 Nowise did God create this
 But in truth and righteousness.
 (Thus) doth He explain His Signs
 In detail, for those who understand.

6. Verily, in the alternation
 Of the Night and the Day,
 And in all that God
 Hath created, in the heavens
 And the earth, are Signs
 For those who fear Him.

7. Those who rest not their hope
 On their meeting with Us,
 But are pleased and satisfied
 With the life of the Present,
 And those who heed not
 Our Signs,--

8. Their abode is the Fire,
 Because of the (evil)
 They earned.

9. Those who believe,
 And work righteousness,--
 Their Lord will guide them
 Because of their Faith:

Beneath them will flow
 Rivers in Gardens of Bliss.

10. (This will be) their cry therein:
 "Glory to Thee, O God!"
 And "Peace" will be their greeting therein!
 And the close of their cry
 Will be: "Praise be to God,
 The Cherisher and Sustainer.
 Of the Worlds!"

  

SECTION 2.

11. If God were to hasten for men
 The ill (they have earned)
 As they would fain hasten on
 The good,--then would
 Their respite be settled at once.
 But We leave those
 Who rest not their hope
 On their meeting with Us,
 In their trespasses, wandering
 In distraction to and fro.

12. When trouble toucheth a man,
 He crieth unto Us
 (In all postures)--lying down 
 On his side, or sitting,
 Or standing. But when We
 Have solved his trouble,
 He passeth on his way as if
 He had never cried to Us
 For a trouble that touched him!
 Thus do the deeds of transgressors
 Seem fair in their eyes!

13. Generations before you
 We destroyed when they
 Did wrong: their Apostles
 Came to them with Clear Signs,
 But they would not believe!
 Thus do We requite
 Those who sin!

14. Then We made you heirs
 In the land after them,
 To see how ye would behave!

15. But when Our Clear Signs
 Are rehearsed unto them,
 Those who rest not their hope
 On their meeting with Us,
 Say: "Bring us a Reading
 Other than this, or change this,"
 Say: "It is not for me,
 Of my own accord,
 To change it: I follow
 Naught but what is revealed
 Unto me: if I were
 To disobey my Lord,
 I should myself fear the Penalty
 Of a Great Day (to come)."

16. Say: "If God had so willed,
 I should not have rehearsed it
 To you, nor whould He
 Have made it known to you.
 A whole life-time before this
 Have I tarried amongst you:
 Will ye not then understand?

17. Who doth more wrong
 Than such as forge a lie
 Against God, or deny
 His Signs? But never
 Will prosper those who sin.

18. They serve, besides God,
 Things that hurt them not
 Nor profit them, and they say:
 "These are our intercessors
 With God." Say: "Do ye
 Indeed inform God of something
 He knows not, in the heavens
 Or on earth?--Glory to Him!
 And far is He above the partners
 They ascribe (to Him)!"

19. Mankind was but one nation,
 But differed (later). Had it not
 Been for a Word
 That went forth before
 From thy Lord, their differences
 Would have been settled
 Between them.

20. They say: "Why is not
 A Sign sent down to him
 From his Lord?" Say:
 "The Unseen is only
 For God (to know).
 Then wait ye: I too

Will wait with you.

  

SECTION 3.

21. When We make mankind
 Taste of some mercy after
 Adversity hath touched them,
 Behold! they take to plotting
 Against Our Signs! Say:
 "Swifter to plan is God!"
 Verily, Our messengers record
 All the plots that ye make!

22. He it is who enableth you
 To traverse through land
 And sea; so that ye even board
 Ships;--they sail with them
 With a favourable wind,
 And they rejoice thereat;
 Then comes a stormy wind
 And the waves come to them
 From all sides, and they think
 They are being overwhelmed:
 They cry unto God, sincerely
 Offering (their) duty unto Him,
 Saying, "If Thou dost deliver us
 From this, we shall truly

Show our gratitude!"

23. But when he delivereth them,
 Behold! they transgress
 Insolently through the earth
 In defiance of right!
 O mankind! your insolence
 Is against your own souls,--
 An enjoyment of the life
 Of the Present: in the end,
 To Us is your return,
 And We shall show you
 The truth of all that ye did.

24. The likeness of the life
 Of the Present is
 As the rain which We
 Send down from the skies:
 By its mingling arises
 The produce of the earth--
 Which provides food
 For men and animals:
 (It grows) till the earth
 Is clad with its golden
 Ornaments and is decked out
 (In beauty): the people to whom
 It belongs think they have
 All powers of disposal over it:
 There reaches it Our command
 By night or by day,
 And We make it
 Like a harvest clean-mown,
 As if it had not flourished

Only the day before!
 Thus do We explain
 The Signs in detail
 For those who reflect.

25. But God doth call
 To the Home of Peace:
 He doth guide whom He pleaseth
 To a Way that is straight.

26. To those who do right
 Is a goodly (reward)--
 Yea, more (than in measure)!
 No darkness nor shame
 Shall cover their faces!
 They are Companions of the Garden;
 They will abide therein
 (For aye)!

27. But those who have earned
 Evil will have a reward
 Of like evil: ignominy
 Will cover their (faces):
 No defender will they have
 From (the wrath of) God:
 Their faces will be covered,
 As it were, with pieces
 From the depth of the darkness
 Of Night: they are Companions

Of the Fire: they will
 Abide therein (for aye)!

28. One Day shall We gather them
 All together. Then shall We say
 To those who joined gods (with Us):
 "To your place! ye and those
 Ye joined as "partners"."
 We shall separate them,
 And their "partners" shall say:
 "It was not us
 That ye worshipped!

29. "Enough is God for a witness
 Between us and you: we
 Certainly knew nothing
 Of your worship of us!"

30. There will every soul prove
 (The fruits of) the deeds
 It sent before : they will
 Be brought back to God
 Their rightful Lord,
 And their invented falsehoods
 Will leave them in the lurch.

  

SECTION 4.

31. Say: "Who is it that
 Sustains you (in life)
 From the sky and from the earth?

Or who is it that
 Has power over hearing
 And sight? And who
 Is it that brings out
 The living from the dead
 And the dead from the living?
 And who is it that
 Rules and regulates all affairs?"
 They will soon say, "God".
 Say, "Will ye not then
 Show piety (to Him)?"

32. Such is God, your real
 Cherisher and Sustainer:
 Apart from Truth,
 What (remains) but error?
 How then are ye turned away?

33. Thus is the Word
 Of thy Lord proved true
 Against those who rebel:
 Verily they will not believe.

34. Say: "Of your 'partners',
 Can any originate creation
 And repeat it?" Say:
 "It is God Who originates
 Creation and repeats it: 
 Then how are ye deluded
 Away (from the truth)?"

35. Say: "Of your "partners"
 Is there any that
 Can give any guidance
 Towards Truth?" Say: "It is God
 Who gives guidance
 Towards Truth. Is then He
 Who gives guidance to Truth
 More worthy to be followed,
 Or he who finds not guidance
 (Himself) unless he is guided?
 What then is the matter
 With you? How judge ye?"

36. But most of them follow
 Nothing but fancy: truly
 Fancy can be of no avail
 Against Truth. Verily God
 Is well aware of all
 That they do.

37. This Qur-an is not such
 As can be produced
 By other than God;
 On the contrary it is
 A confirmation of (revelations)
 That went before it,
 And a fuller explanation
 Of the Book--wherein
 There is no doubt
 From the Lord of the Worlds.

38. Or do they say,
 "He forged it"?
 Say: "Bring then
 A Sura like unto it,
 And call (to your aid)
 Anyone you can,
 Besides God, if it be
 Ye speak the truth!"

39. Nay, they charge with falsehood
 That whose knowledge they
 Cannot compass, even before
 The elucidation thereof"
 Hath reached them: thus
 Did those before them
 Make charges of falsehood:
 But see what was the end
 Of those who did wrong!

40. Of them there are some
 Who believe therein,
 And some who do not:
 And thy Lord knoweth best
 Those who are out for mischief.

  

SECTION 5.

41. If they charge thee
 With falsehood, say:
 "My work to me,
 And yours to you!

Ye are free from responsibility
 For what I do, and I
 For what ye do!"

42. Among them are some who
 (Pretend to) listen to thee:
 But canst thou make the deaf
 To hear,--even though
 They are without understanding?

43. And among them are some
 Who look at thee:
 But canst thou guide
 The blind,--even though
 They will not see?

44. Verily God will not deal
 Unjustly with man in aught:
 It is man that wrongs
 His own soul.

45. One day He will
 Gather them together:
 (It will be) as if
 They had tarried
 But an hour of a day:
 They will recognise each other:
 Assuredly those will be lost
 Who denied the meeting
 With God and refused
 To receive true guidance.

46. Whether We show thee
 (Realised in thy life-time)
 Some part of what We
 Promise them,--or We

Take thy soul (to Our Mercy)
 (Before that),--in any case,
 To Us is their return:
 Ultimately God is witness.
 To all that they do.

47. To every people (was sent)
 An Apostle: when their Apostle
 Comes (before them), the matter
 Will be judged between them
 With justice, and they
 Will not be wronged.

48. They say: "When
 Will this promise
 Come to pass,
 If ye speak the truth?"

49. Say: "I have no power
 Over any harm or profit
 To myself except as God
 Willeth. To every People
 Is a term appointed:
 When their term is reached,
 Not an hour can they cause
 Delay, nor (an hour) can they
 Advance (it in anticipation)."

50. Say: "Do ye see,
 If His punishment should come
 To you by night or by day,--
 What portion of it
 Would the Sinners
 Wish to hasten?

51. "Would ye then believe in it
 At last, when it actually cometh
 To pass? (It will then be said:)
 'Ah! now? and ye wanted
 (Aforetime) to hasten it on!'

52. "At length will be said
 To the wrong-doers: 'Taste ye
 The enduring punishment!
 Ye get but the recompense
 Of what ye earned!'"

53. They seek to be informed
 By thee: "Is that true?"
 Say: "Aye! by my Lord!
 It is the very truth!
 And ye cannot frustrate it!"

  

SECTION 6.

54. Every soul that hath sinned,
 If it possessed all
 That is on earth,
 Would fain give it in ransom:

They would declare (their) repentance
 When they see the Penalty:
 But the judgment between them
 Will be with justice,
 And no wrong will be done
 Unto them.

55. Is it not (the case) that to God
 Belongeth whatever is
 In the heavens and on earth?
 Is it not (the case) that
 God's promise is assuredly true?
 Yet most of them understand not.

56. It is He who giveth life
 And who taketh it,
 And to Him shall ye
 All be brought back.

57. O mankind! there hath come
 To you a direction from your Lord
 And a healing for the (diseases)
 In your hearts,--and for those
 Who believe, a Guidance
 And a Mercy.

58. Say: "In the Bounty of God.
 And in His Mercy,--in that
 Let them rejoice": that is better
 Than the (wealth) they hoard.

59. Say: "See ye what things
 God hath sent down to you

For sustenance? Yet ye
 Hold forbidden some things
 Thereof and (some things) lawful."
 Say: "Hath God indeed
 Permitted you, or do ye invent
 (Things) to attribute to God?"

60. And what think those
 Who invent lies against God,
 Of the Day of Judgment?
 Verily God is full of Bounty
 To mankind, but most
 Of them are ungrateful!"

  

SECTION 7.

61. In whatever business thou
 Mayest be, and whatever portion
 Thou mayest be reciting
 From the Qur-an,--and whatever
 Deed ye (mankind) may be doing,--
 We are Witnesses thereof
 When ye are deeply engrossed
 Therein. Nor is hidden
 From thy Lord (so much as)
 The weight of an atom
 On the earth or in heaven.
 And not the least
 And not the greatest
 Of these things but are recorded
 In a clear Record.

62. Behold! verily on the friends
 Of God there is no fear,

Nor shall they grieve;

63. Those who believe
 And (constantly) guard
 Against evil;--

64. For them are Glad Tidings,
 In the life of the Present
 And in the Hereafter:
 No change can there be
 In the Words of God.
 This is indeed
 The supreme Felicity.

65. Let not their speech
 Grieve thee: for all power
 And honour belong to God:
 It is He Who heareth
 And knoweth (all things).

66. Behold! verily to God
 Belong all creatures,
 In the heavens and on earth.
 What do they follow
 Who worship as His "partners"
 Other than God? They follow
 Nothing but fancy, and
 They do nothing but lie.

67. He it is that hath
 Made you the Night
 That ye may rest therein,
 And the Day to make
 Things visible (to you).
 Verily in this are Signs
 For those who listen
 (To His Message).

68. They say, "God hath begotten
 A son!"--Glory be to Him!
 He is Self-Sufficient! His
 Are all things in the heavens
 And on earth! No warrant
 Have ye for this! Say ye
 About God what ye know not?

69. Say: "Those who invent
 A lie against God
 Will never prosper."

70. A little enjoyment
 In this world!--
 And then, to Us
 Will be their return.
 Then shall We make them
 Taste the severest Penalty
 For their blasphemies.

  

SECTION 8.

71. Relate to them the story
 Of Noah. Behold! he said
 To his People: "O my People,
 If it be hard on your (mind)

That I should stay (with you)
 And commemorate the Signs
 Of God,--yet I put
 My trust in God.
 Get ye then an agreement
 About your plan and among
 Your Partners, so your plan
 Be not to you dark and dubious.
 Then pass your sentence on me,
 And give me no respite.

72. "But if ye turn back, (consider):
 No reward have I asked
 Of you: my reward is only
 Due from God, and I
 Have been commanded to be
 Of those who submit
 To God's Will (in Islam)."

73. They rejected him,
 But We delivered him,
 And those with him,
 In the Ark, and We made
 Them inherit (the earth),
 While We overwhelmed
 In the Flood those
 Who rejected Our Signs.
 Then see what was the end
 Of those who were warned
 (But heeded not)!

74. Then after him We sent
 (Many) apostles to their Peoples:
 They brought them Clear Signs,
 But they would not believe
 What they had already rejected

Beforehand. Thus do We seal
 The hearts of the transgressors.

75. Then after them sent We
 Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh
 And his chiefs with Our Signs.
 But they were arrogant:
 They were a people in sin.

76. When the Truth did come
 To them from Us, they said:
 "This is indeed evident sorcery!"

77. Said Moses: "Say ye (this)
 About the Truth when
 It hath (actually) reached you?
 Is sorcery (like) this?
 But sorcerers will not prosper."

78. They said: "Hast thou
 Come to us to turn us
 Away from the ways
 We found our fathers following,--
 In order that thou and thy brother
 May have greatness in the land?
 But not we shall believe in you!"

79. Said Pharaoh: "Bring me
 Every sorcerer well versed."

80. When the sorcerers came,
 Moses said to them:
 "Throw ye what ye (wish)
 To throw!"

81. When they had had their throw,
 Moses said: "What ye
 Have brought is sorcery:
 God will surely make it
 Of no effect: for God
 Prospereth not the work
 Of those who make mischief.

82. "And God by His Words
 Doth prove and establish
 His Truth, however much
 The Sinners may hate it!"

  

SECTION 9.

83. But none believed in Moses
 Except some children of his People,
 Because of the fear of Pharaoh
 And his chiefs, lest they
 Should persecute them; and certainly
 Pharaoh was mighty on the earth
 And one who transgressed all bounds.

84. Moses said: "O my People!
 If ye do (really) believe
 In God, then in Him
 Put your trust if ye
 Submit (your will to His)."

85. They said: "In God
 Do we put our trust.

Our Lord! make us not
 A trial for those
 Who practise oppression;

86."And deliver us by Thy Mercy
 From those who reject (Thee)."

87. We inspired Moses and his brother
 With this Message: "Provide
 Dwellings for your People
 In Egypt, make your dwellings
 Into places of worship,
 And establish regular prayers:
 And give Glad Tidings
 To those who believe!"

88. Moses prayed: "Our Lord!
 Thou hast indeed bestowed
 On Pharaoh and his Chiefs
 Splendour and wealth in the life
 Of the Present, and so,
 Our Lord, they mislead (men)
 From Thy Path. Deface.
 Our Lord, the features of their wealth,
 And send hardness to their hearts,
 So they will not believe

Until they see
 The grievous Penalty."

89. God said: "Accepted is
 Your prayer (O Moses and Aaron)
 So stand ye straight,
 And follow not the path
 Of those who know not.

90. We took the Children
 Of Israel across the sea:
 Pharaoh and his hosts followed them
 In insolence and spite.
 At length, when overwhelmed
 With the flood, he said:
 "I believe that there is no god
 Except Him Whom the Children
 Of Israel believe in:
 I am of those who submit
 (To God in Islam)."

91. (It was said to him:)
 "Ah now!--But a little while
 Before, wast thou in rebellion!--
 And thou didst mischief (and violence)!

92. "This day shall We save thee
 In thy body, that thou
 Mayest be a Sign to those
 Who come after thee!
 But verily, many among mankind
 Are heedless of Our Signs!"

  

SECTION 10.

93. We settled the Children
 Of Israel in a beautiful
 Dwelling-place, and provided
 For them sustenance of the best:
 It was after knowledge had been
 Granted to them, that they
 Fell into schisms. Verily
 God will judge between them
 As to the schisms amongst them,
 On the Day of Judgment.

94. If thou wert in doubt
 As to what We have revealed
 Unto thee, then ask those
 Who have been reading
 The Book from before thee:
 The Truth hath indeed come
 To thee from thy Lord:
 So be in no wise
 Of those in doubt.

95. Nor be of those who reject
 The Signs of God,
 Or thou shalt be of those
 Who perish.

96. Whose against whom the Word
 Of thy Lord hath been verified

Would not believe--

97. Even if every Sign was brought
 Unto them,--until they see
 (For themselves) the Penalty Grievous.

98. Why was there not
 A single township (among those
 We warned), which believed,--
 So its Faith should have
 Profited it,--except the People
 Of Jonah? When they believed,
 We removed from them
 The Penalty of Ignominy
 In the life of the Present,
 And permitted them to enjoy
 (Their life) for a while.

99. If it had been thy Lord's Will,
 They would all have believed,--
 All who are on earth!
 Wilt thou then compel mankind,

Against their will, to believe!

100. No soul can believe, except
 By the Will of God,
 And He will place Doubt
 (Or obscurity) on those
 Who will not understand.

101. Say: "Behold all that is
 In the heavens and on earth ";
 But neither Signs nor Warners
 Profit those who believe not.

102. Do they then expect
 (Any thing) but (what happened
 In) the days of the men
 Who passed away before them?
 Say: "Wait ye then:
 For I, too, will wait with you."

103. In the end We deliver
 Our apostles and those who believe:
 Thus is it fitting on Our part
 That We should deliver
 Those who believe!

  

SECTION 11.

104. Say: "O ye men!
 If ye are in doubt
 As to my religion, (behold!)
 I worship not what ye
 Worship, other than God!
 But I worship God
 Who will take your souls
 (At death): I am commanded
 To be (in the ranks)
 Of the Believers,

105. "And further (thus), "set thy face
 Towards Religion with true piety,
 And never in any wise
 Be of the Unbelievers;

106. "Nor call on any,
 Other than God;--
 Such will neither profit thee
 Nor hurt thee: if thou dost,
 Behold! thou shalt certainly
 Be of those who do wrong."

107. If God do touch thee
 With hurt, there is none
 Can remove it but He:
 If He do design some benefit

For thee, there is none
 Can keep back His favour:
 He causeth it to reach
 Whomsoever of His servants
 He pleaseth. And He is
 The Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

108. Say: "O ye men! Now
 Truth hath reached you
 From your Lord! Those who receive
 Guidance, do so for the good
 Of their own souls; those
 Who stray, do so to their own loss:
 And I am not (set) over you
 To arrange your affairs."

109. Follow thou the inspiration
 Sent unto thee, and be
 Patient and constant, till God
 Do decide: for He
 Is the Best to decide.



  

Sura XI.

  

Hud (The Prophet Hud).



1. A. L. R.
 (This is) a Book,
 With verses basic or fundamental
 (Of established meaning),
 Further explained in detail,--
 From One Who is Wise
 And Well-Acquainted (with al] things):

2. (It teacheth) that ye should
 Worship none but God.
 (Say:) "Verily I am
 (Sent) unto you from Him
 To warn and to bring
 Glad tidings:

3. "(And to preach thus), "Seek ye
 The forgiveness of your Lord,
 And turn to Him in repentance;
 That He may grant you
 Enjoyment, good (and true),
 For a term appointed,
 And bestow His abounding grace
 On all who abound in merit!
 But if ye turn away,
 Then I fear for you
 The Penalty of a Great Day:

4. "'To God is your return,
 And He hath power
 Over all things.'"

5. Behold! they fold up
 Their hearts, that they may lie
 Hid from Him! Ah! even
 When they cover themselves
 With their garments, He knoweth
 What they conceal, and what
 They reveal: for He knoweth
 Well the (inmost secrets)
 Of the hearts

6. Where is no moving creature
 On earth but its sustenance
 Dependeth on God: He knoweth
 The time and place of its
 Definite abode and its
 Temporary deposit:
 All is in a clear Record.

7. He it is Who created
 The heavens and the earth
 In six Days--and His Throne
 Was over the Waters--
 That He might try you,
 Which of you is best
 In conduct. But if
 Thou wert to say to them,
 "Ye shall indeed be raised up
 After death", the Unbelievers
 Would be sure to say,
 "This is nothing but
 Obvious sorcery!"

8. If We delay the penalty
 For them for a definite term,
 They are sure to say,
 "What keeps it back?"

Ah! On the day it (actually)
 Reaches them, nothing will.
 Turn it away from them,
 And they will be completely
 Encircled by that which
 They used to mock at!

  

SECTION 2.

9. If We give man a taste
 Of Mercy from Ourselves,
 And then withdraw it from him,
 Behold! he is in despair
 And (falls into) blasphemy.

10. But if We give hint a taste
 Of (Our) favours after
 Adversity hath touched him,
 He is sure to say,
 "All evil has departed from me:
 Behold! he falls into exultation
 And pride.

11. Not so do those who show
 Patience and constancy, and work
 Righteousness; for them
 Is forgiveness (of sins)
 And a great reward.

12. Perchance thou mayest (feel
 The inclination) to give up
 A part of what is revealed
 Unto thee, and thy heart

Feeleth straitened lest they say,
 "Why is not a treasure sent down
 Unto him, or why does not
 An angel come down with him?"
 But thou art there only to warn!
 It is God that arrangeth
 All affairs!

13. Or they may say, "He forged it."
 Say, "Bring ye then ten Suras
 Forged, like unto it, and call
 (To your aid) whomsoever
 Ye can, other than God!--
 If ye speak the truth!

14. "If then they (your false gods)
 Answer not your (call),
 Know ye that this Revelation
 Is sent down (replete) with the knowledge
 Of God, and that there is
 No god but He! Will ye
 Even then submit (to Islam)?"

15. Those who desire
 The life of the Present
 And its glitter,--to them
 We shall pay (the price
 Of) their deeds therein,--
 Without diminution.

16. They are those for whom
 There is nothing in the Hereafter
 But the Fire: vain
 Are the designs they frame therein,
 And of no effect
 Are the deeds that they do!

17. Can they be (like) those
 Who accept a Clear (Sign)
 From their Lord, and whom
 A witness from Himself

Doth teach, as did the Book
 Of Moses before it,--a guide
 And a mercy? They believe
 Therein; but those of the Sects
 That reject it,--the Fire
 Will be their promised
 Meeting-place. Be not then
 In doubt thereon: for it is
 The Truth from thy Lord:
 Yet many among men
 Do not believe!

18. Who doth more wrong
 Than those who invent a lie
 Against God? They will be
 Turned back to the presence
 Of their Lord, and the witnesses
 Will say, "These are the ones
 Who lied against their Lord!
 Behold! the Curse of God
 Is on those who do wrong!--

19. "Those who would hinder (men)
 From the path of God
 And would seek in it
 Something crooked: these were
 They who denied the Hereafter!"

20. They will in no wise
 Frustrate (His design) on earth,
 Nor have they protectors
 Besides God! Their penalty
 Will be doubled! They lost
 The power to hear,
 And they did not see!

21. They are the ones who
 Have lost their own souls:

And the (fancies) they invented
 Have left them in the lurch!

22. Without a doubt, these
 Are the very ones who
 Will lose most in the Hereafter!

23. But those who believe
 And work righteousness,
 And humble themselves
 Before their Lord,--
 They will be Companions
 Of the Garden, to dwell
 Therein for aye!

24. These two kinds (of men)
 May be compared to
 The blind and deaf,
 And those who can see
 And hear well. Are they
 Equal when compared?
 Will ye not then take heed?

  

SECTION 3.

25. We sent Noah to his People
 (With a mission): "I have come
 To you with a Clear Warning:

26. "That ye serve none but God:
 Verily I do fear for you

The Penalty of a Grievous Day."

27. But the Chiefs of the Unbelievers
 Among his People said:
 "We see (in) thee nothing
 But a man like ourselves:
 Nor do we see that any
 Follow thee but the meanest
 Among us, in judgment immature:
 Nor do we see in you (all)
 Any merit above us:
 In fact we think ye are liars!"

28. He said: "O my People!
 See ye if (it be that)
 I have a Clear Sign
 From my Lord, and that He
 Hath sent Mercy unto me
 From His own Presence, but
 That the Mercy hath been
 Obscured from your sight?
 Shall we compel you
 To accept it when ye
 Are averse to it?

29. "And O my People!
 I ask you for no wealth

In return: my reward
 Is from none but God:
 But I will not drive away
 (In contempt) those who believe:
 For verily they are
 To meet their Lord, and ye
 I see are the ignorant ones!

30. "And O my People!
 Who would help me against God
 If I drove them away?
 Will ye not then take heed?

31. "I tell you not that
 With me are the Treasures
 Of God, nor do I know
 What is hidden,
 Nor claim I to be
 An angel. Nor yet
 Do I say, of those whom
 Your eyes do despise
 That God will not grant them
 (All) that is good:
 God knoweth best
 What is in their souls:
 I should, if I did,
 Indeed be a wrong-doer."

32. They said: "O Noah!
 Thou hast disputed with us,

And (much) hast thou prolonged
 The dispute with us: now
 Bring upon us what thou
 Threatenest us with, if thou
 Speakest the truth!?"

33. He said: "Truly, God
 Will bring it on you
 If He wills,--and then,
 Ye will not be able
 To frustrate it!

34. "Of no profit will be
 My counsel to you,
 Much as I desire
 To give you (good) counsel,
 If it be that God
 Willeth to leave you astray:
 He is your Lord!
 And to Him will ye return!"

35. Or do they say,
 "He has forged it "? Say:
 "If I had forged it,
 On me were my sin!
 And I am free
 Of the sins of which
 Ye are guilty!

  

SECTION 4.

36. It was revealed to Noah:
 "None of thy People will believe
 Except those who have believed
 Already! So grieve no longer
 Over their (evil) deeds.

37. "But construct an Ark
 Under Our eyes and Our
 Inspiration, and address Me
 No (further) on behalf
 Of those who are in sin:
 For they are about to be
 Overwhelmed (in the Flood)."

38. Forthwith he (starts)
 Constructing the Ark:
 Every time that the Chiefs
 Of his People passed by him,
 They threw ridicule on him.
 He said: "If ye ridicule
 Us now, we (in our turn)
 Can look down on you
 With ridicule likewise!

39. "But soon will ye know
 Who it is on whom
 Will descend a Penalty
 That will cover them

With shame,--on whom will be
 Unloosed a Penalty lasting:"

40. At length, behold!
 There came Our Command,
 And the fountains of the earth
 Gushed forth! We said:
 "Embark therein, of each kind
 Two, male and female,
 And your family--except
 Those against whom the Word
 Has already gone forth,--
 And the Believers."
 But only a few
 Believed with him.

41. So he said: "Embark ye
 On the Ark,
 In the name of God,
 Whether it move
 Or be at rest!
 For my Lord is, be sure,
 Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful!"

42. So the Ark floated
 With them on the waves
 (Towering) like mountains,
 And Noah called out
 To his son, who had
 Separated himself (from the rest):
 "O my son! embark
 With us, and be not
 With the Unbelievers!"

43. The son replied: "I will
 Betake myself to some mountain:
 It will save me from
 The water." Noah said:
 "This day nothing can save,
 From the Command of God,
 Any but those on whom
 He hath mercy!"--
 And the waves came
 Between them, and the son
 Was among those
 Overwhelmed in the Flood.

44. Then the word went forth:
 "O earth! swallow up
 Thy water, and O sky!
 Withhold (thy rain)!"
 And the water abated,
 And the matter was ended.
 The Ark rested on Mount
 Judi, and the word
 Went forth: "Away
 With those who do wrong!"

45. And Noah called upon
 His Lord, and said:
 "O my Lord! surely
 My son is of my family!
 And Thy promise is true,
 And Thou art
 The Justest of Judges!"

46. He said: "O Noah!
 He is not of thy family:
 For his conduct is unrighteous.
 So ask not of Me
 That of which thou
 Hast no knowledge!
 I give thee counsel, lest
 Thou act like the ignorant!"

47. Noah said: "O my Lord!
 I do seek refuge with Thee,
 Lest I ask Thee for that
 Of which I have no knowledge.
 And unless Thou forgive me
 And have Mercy on me,
 I should indeed be lost!"

48. The word came: "O Noah!
 Come down (from the Ark)
 With Peace from Us,
 And Blessing on thee
 And on some of the Peoples
 (Who will spring) from those
 With thee: but (there will be
 Other) Peoples to whom We
 Shall grant their pleasures
 (For a time), but in the end
 Will a grievous Penalty
 Reach them from Us."

49. Such are some of the stories
 Of the Unseen, which We
 Have revealed unto thee:
 Before this, neither thou
 Nor thy People knew them.
 So persevere patiently:
 For the End is for those
 Who are righteous.

  

SECTION 5.

50. To the 'Ad People
 (We sent) Hud, one
 Of their own brethren.
 He said: "O my people!
 Worship God! ye have
 No other god but Him.
 (Your other gods) ye do nothing
 But invent!

51. "O my people! I ask of you
 No reward for this (Message).
 My reward is from none
 But Him who created me:
 Will ye not then understand?

52. "And O my people! Ask
 Forgiveness of your Lord,

And turn to Him (in repentance):
 He will send you the skies
 Pouring abundant rain,
 And add strength
 To your strength:
 So turn ye not back
 In sin!"

53. They said: "O Hud!
 No Clear (Sign) hast thou
 Brought us, and we are not
 The ones to desert our gods
 On thy word! Nor shall we
 Believe in thee!

54. "We say nothing but that
 (Perhaps) some of our gods
 May have seized thee
 With imbecility." He said:
 "I call God to witness,
 And do ye bear witness,
 That I am free from the sin
 Of ascribing, to Him,

55. "Other gods as partners!
 So scheme (your worst) against me,
 All of you, and give me
 No respite.

56. "I put my trust in God,
 My Lord and your Lord!
 There is not a moving
 Creature, but He hath
 Grasp of its fore-lock.
 Verily, it is my Lord
 That is on a straight Path.

57. "If ye turn away,--
 I (at least) have conveyed
 The Message with which I
 Was sent to you. My Lord
 Will make another People
 To succeed you, and you
 Will not harm Him
 In the least. For my Lord
 Hath care and watch
 Over all things."

58. So when Our decree
 Issued, We saved Hud
 And those who believed
 With him, by (special) Grace
 From Ourselves: We saved them
 From a severe Penalty.

59. Such were the 'Ad People:
 They rejected the Signs

Of their Lord and Cherisher;
 Disobeyed His Apostles;
 And followed the command
 Of every powerful, obstinate
 Transgressor.

60. And they were pursued
 By a Curse in this Life,
 And on the Day of Judgment.
 Ah! Behold! For the 'Ad
 Rejected their Lord and Cherisher
 Ah! Behold! Removed (from sight)
 Were 'Ad the People of Hud!

  

SECTION 6.

61. To the Thamud People
 (We sent) Salih, one
 Of their own brethren.
 He said: "O my People!
 Worship God: ye have
 No other God but Him.
 It is He Who hath produced you
 From the earth and settled you
 Therein: then ask forgiveness
 Of Him, and turn to Him
 (In repentance): for my Lord
 Is (always) near, ready
 To answer."

62. They said: "O Salib!
 Thou hast been of us!--

A centre of our hopes
 Hitherto! Dost thou (now)
 Forbid us the worship
 Of what our fathers worshipped?
 But we are really
 In suspicious (disquieting)
 Doubt as to that to which
 Thou invitest us."

63. He said: "O my people!
 Do ye see?--If I have
 A Clear (Sign) from my Lord
 And He hath sent Mercy
 Unto me from Himself,--who
 Then can help me
 Against God if I were
 To disobey Him? What
 Then would ye add
 To my (portion) but perdition?

64. "And O my people!
 This she-camel of God is
 A symbol to you:
 Leave her to feed
 On God's (free) earth,
 And inflict no harm
 On her, or a swift Penalty
 Will seize you!"

65. But they did ham-string her.
 So he said: "Enjoy yourselves
 In your homes for three days:
 (Then will be your ruin):

(Behold) there a promise
 Not to be belied!"

66. When Our Decree issued,
 We saved Salib and those
 Who believed with him,
 By (special) Grace from
 Ourselves--
 And from the Ignominy
 Of that Day. For thy Lord--
 He is the Strong One, and Able
 To enforce His Will.

67. The (mighty) Blast overtook
 The wrong-doers, and they
 Lay prostrate in their homes
 Before the morning,--

68. As if they had never
 Dwelt and flourished there.
 Ah! Behold! For the Thamud
 Rejected their Lord and Cherisher!
 Ah! Behold! Removed
 (From sight) were the Thamud!

  

SECTION 7.

69. There came Our Messengers
 To Abraham with glad tidings.

They said, "Peace!" He answered,
 "Peace!" and hastened
 To entertain them
 With a roasted calf.

70. But when he saw
 Their hands went not
 Towards the (meal), he felt
 Some mistrust of them,
 And conceived a fear of them.
 They said: "Fear not:
 We have been sent
 Against the people of Lut."

71. And his wife was standing
 (There), and she laughed:
 But We gave her
 Glad tidings of Isaac,
 And after him, of Jacob.

72. She said: "Alas for me!
 Shall I bear a ,
 Seeing I am an old woman,
 And my husband here
 Is an old man?
 That would indeed
 Be a wonderful thing!"

73. They said: "Dost thou
 Wonder at God's decree?
 The grace of God
 And His blessings on you,
 O ye people of the house!
 For He is indeed
 Worthy of all praise,
 Full of all glory!"

74. When fear had passed
 From (the mind of) Abraham
 And the glad tidings
 Had reached him, he
 Began to plead with Us
 For Lut's people.

75. For Abraham was,
 Without doubt, forbearing
 (Of faults), compassionate,
 And given to look to God.

76. O Abraham! Seek not this.
 The decree of thy Lord
 Hath gone forth: for them
 There cometh a Penalty

That cannot be turned back!

77. When Our Messengers
 Came to Lut, he was
 Grieved on their account
 And felt himself powerless
 (To protect) them. He said:
 "This is a distressful day."

78. And his people came
 Rushing towards him,
 And they had been long
 In the habit of practising
 Abominations. He said:
 "O my people! Here are
 My daughters: they are purer
 For you (if ye marry)!
 Now fear God, and cover me not
 With shame about my guests!
 Is there not among you
 A single right-minded man?"

79. They said: "Well dost thou
 Know we have no need
 Of thy daughters: indeed
 Thou knowest quite well
 What we want!"

80. He said: "Would that I
 Had power to suppress you

Or that I could betake
 Myself to some powerful support."

81. (The Messengers) said: "O Lut
 We are Messengers from thy Lord!
 By no means shall they
 Reach thee! Now travel
 With thy family while yet
 A part of the night remains,
 And let not any of you
 Look back: but thy wife
 (Will remain behind):
 To her will happen
 What happens to the people.
 Morning is their time appointed:
 Is not the morning nigh?"

82. When Our decree issued,
 We turned (the cities)
 Upside down, and rained down
 On them brimstones
 Hard as baked clay,
 Spread, layer on layer,--

83. Marked as from thy Lord:

Nor are they ever far
 From those who do wrong!

  

SECTION 8.

84. To the Madyan people
 (We sent) Shu'aib, one
 Of their own brethren: he said:
 "O my people! worship God:
 Ye have no other god
 But Him. And give not
 Short measure or weight:
 I see you in prosperity,
 But I fear for you
 The Penalty of a Day
 That will compass (you) all round.

85. "And O my people! give
 Just measure and weight,
 Nor withhold from the people
 The things that are their due:
 Commit not evil in the land
 With intent to do mischief.

86. "That which is left you
 By God is best for you,

If ye (but) believed!
 But I am not set
 Over you to keep watch!"

87. They said: "O Shu'aib!
 Does thy (religion of) prayer
 Command thee that we
 Leave off the worship which
 Our fathers practised, or
 That we leave off doing
 What we like with our property?
 Truly, thou art the one
 That forbeareth with faults
 And is right-minded!"

88. He said: "O my people!
 See ye whether I hate
 A Clear (Sign) from my Lord,
 And He hath given me
 Sustenance (pure and) good
 As from Himself? I wish not,
 In opposition to you, to do
 That which I forbid you to do.
 I only desire (your) betterment
 To the best of my power;
 And my success (in my task)
 Can only come from God.
 In Him I trust,
 And unto Him I look.

89. "And O my people!
 Let not my dissent (from you)

Cause you to sin,
 Lest ye suffer
 A fate similar to that
 Of the people of Noah
 Or of Hud or of Salib,
 Nor are the people of Lut
 Far off from you!

90. "But ask forgiveness
 Of your Lord, and turn
 Unto Him (in repentance):
 For my Lord is indeed
 Full of mercy and loving-kindness."

91. They said: "O Shu'aib!
 Much of what thou sayest
 We do not understand!
 In fact among us we see
 That thou hast no strength!
 Were it not for thy family,
 We should certainly
 Have stoned thee!
 For thou hast among us
 No great position!"

92. He said: "O my people!
 Is then my family
 Of more consideration with you
 Than God? For ye cast Him
 Away behind your backs
 (With contempt). But verily
 My Lord encompasseth
 On all sides
 All that ye do!

93. "And O my people!
 Do whatever ye can:

I will do (my part):
 Soon will ye know
 Who it is on whom
 Descends the Penalty
 Of ignominy, and who
 Is a liar!
 And watch ye!
 For I too am watching
 With you!"

94. When Our decree issued,
 We saved Shu'aib and those
 Who believed with him,
 By (special) Mercy from Ourselves
 But the (mighty) Blast did seize
 The wrong-doers, and they
 Lay prostrate in their homes
 By the morning,--

95. As if they had never
 Dwelt and flourished there!
 Ah! Behold! How the Madyan
 Were removed (from sight)
 As were removed the Thamud!

  

SECTION 9.

96. And we sent Moses,
 With our Clear (signs)
 And an authority manifest,

97. Unto Pharaoh and his Chiefs:
 But they followed the command
 Of Pharaoh, and the command
 Of Pharaoh was no right (guide).

98. He will go before his people
 On the Day of Judgment,
 And lead them into the Fire
 (As cattle are led to water):
 But woeful indeed will be
 The place to which they are led!

99. And they are followed
 By a curse in this (life)
 And on the Day of Judgment:
 And woeful is the gift
 Which shall be given
 (Unto them)!

100. These are some of the stories
 Of communities which We
 Relate unto thee: of them
 Some are standing, and some

Have been mown down
 (By the sickle of time.

101. It was not We that wronged them:
 They wronged their own souls:
 The deities, other than God,
 Whom they invoked, profited them
 No whit when there issued
 The decree of thy Lord:
 Nor did they add aught
 (To their lot) but perdition!

102. Such is the chastisement
 Of thy Lord when He chastises
 Communities in the midst of
 Their wrong: grievous, indeed,
 And severe is His chastisement.

103. In that is a Sign
 For those who fear
 The Penalty of the Hereafter:
 That is a Day for which mankind
 Will be gathered together:
 That will be a Day
 Of Testimony.

104. Nor shall We delay it
 But for a term appointed.

105. The day it arrives,
 No soul shall speak

Except by His leave:
 Of those (gathered) some
 Will be wretched and some
 Will be blessed.

106. Those who are wretched
 Shall be in the Fire:
 There will be for them
 Therein (nothing but) the heaving
 Of sighs and sobs:

107. They will dwell therein
 For all the time that
 The heavens and the earth
 Endure, except as thy Lord
 Willeth: for thy Lord
 Is the (sure) Accomplisher
 Of what He planneth.

108. And those who are blessed
 Shall be in the Garden:
 They will dwell therein
 For all the time that
 The heavens and the earth
 Endure, except as thy Lord
 Willeth: a gift without break.

109. Be not then in doubt
 As to what these men
 Worship. They worship nothing
 But what their fathers worshipped
 Before (them): but verily
 We shall pay them back
 (In full) their portion
 Without (the least) abatement.

  

SECTION 10.

110. We certainly gave the Book
 To Moses, but differences
 Arose therein: had it not been
 That a Word had gone forth
 Before from thy Lord, the matter
 Would have been decided
 Between them: but they
 Are in suspicious doubt
 Concerning it.

111. And, of a surety, to all
 Will your Lord pay back
 (In full the recompense)
 Of their deeds: for He
 Knoweth well all that they do.

112. Therefore stand firm (in the straight
 Path) as thou art commanded,--

Thou and those who with thee
 Turn (unto God); and transgress not
 (From the Path): for He seeth
 Well all that ye do.

113. And incline not to those
 Who do wrong, or the Fire
 Will seize you; and ye have
 No protectors other than God,
 Nor shall ye be helped.

114. And establish regular prayers
 At the two ends of the day
 And at the approaches of the night:
 For those things that are good
 Remove those that are evil:
 Be that the word of remembrance
 To those who remember (their Lord):

115. And be steadfast in patience;
 For verily God will not suffer
 The reward of the righteous
 To perish.

116. Why were there not,
 Among the generations before you,
 Persons possessed of balanced
 Good sense, prohibiting (men)

From mischief in the earth--
 Except a few among them
 Whom We saved (from harm)?
 But the wrong-doers pursued
 The enjoyment of the good things
 Of life which were given them,
 And persisted in sin.

117. Nor would thy Lord be
 The One to destroy
 Communities for a single wrong-doing,
 If its members were likely
 To mend.

118. If thy Lord had so willed,
 He could have made mankind
 One People: but they
 Will not cease to dispute,

119. Except those on whom thy Lord
 Hath bestowed His Mercy:
 And for this did He create
 Them: and the Word
 Of thy Lord shall be fulfilled:
 "I will fill Hell with jinns
 And men all together."

120. All that we relate to thee
 Of the stories of the apostles,--
 With it We make firm
 Thy heart: in them there cometh
 To thee the Truth, as well as
 An exhortation and a message
 Of remembrance to those who believe.

121. Say to those who do not
 Believe: "Do whatever ye can:
 We shall do our part;

122. "And wait ye!
 We too shall wait."

123. To God do belong
 The unseen (secrets)
 Of the heavens and the earth,
 And to Him goeth back
 Every affair (for decision)
 Then worship Him,
 And put thy trust in Him .
 And thy Lord is not
 Unmindful of aught
 That ye do.



  

Sura XII.

  

Yusuf, or Joseph.



1. A. L. R. These are
 The Symbols (or Verses)
 Of the Perspicuous Book.

2. We have sent it down
 As an Arabic Qur-an,
 In order that ye may
 Learn wisdom.

3. We do relate unto thee
 The most beautiful of stories,
 In that We reveal to thee
 This (portion of the) Qur-an:
 Before this, thou too
 Was among those
 Who knew it not.

4. Behold, Joseph said
 To his father: "O my father!

I did see eleven stars
 And the sun and the moon:
 I saw them prostrate themselves
 To me!"

5. Said (the father):
 "My (dear) little son!
 Relate not thy vision
 To thy brothers, lest they
 Concoct a plot against thee:
 For Satan is to man
 An avowed enemy!

6. "Thus will thy Lord
 Choose thee and teach thee
 The interpretation of stories (and events)
 And perfect His favour
 To thee and to the posterity
 Of Jacob--even as He
 Perfected it to thy fathers
 Abraham and Isaac aforetime!
 For God is full of knowledge
 And wisdom."

  

SECTION 2.

7. Verily in Joseph and his brethren
 Are Signs (or Symbols)

For Seekers (after Truth).

8. They said: "Truly Joseph
 And his brother are loved
 More by our father than we:
 But we are a goodly body!
 Really our father is obviously
 Wandering (in his mind)!

9. "Slay ye Joseph or cast him out
 To some (unknown) land,
 That so the favour
 Of your father may be
 Given to you alone:
 (There will be time enough)
 For you to be righteous after that!"

10. Said one of them: "Slay not
 Joseph, but if ye must
 Do something, throw him down
 To the bottom of the well:
 He will be picked up
 By some caravan of travellers."

11. They said: "O our father!
 Why dost thou not
 Trust us with Joseph,
 Seeing we are indeed
 His sincere well-wishers?

12. "Send him with us tomorrow
 To enjoy himself and play,
 And we shall take
 Every care of him."

13. (Jacob) said: "Really
 It saddens me that ye
 Should take him away:
 I fear lest the wolf
 Should devour him
 While ye attend not
 To him."

14. They said: "If the wolf
 Were to devour him
 While we are (so large) a party,
 Then should we indeed
 (First) have perished ourselves!"

15. So they did take him away,
 And they all agreed

To throw him down
 To the bottom of the well:
 And We put into his heart
 (This Message): "Of a surety
 Thou shalt (one day)
 Tell them the truth
 Of this their affair
 While they know (thee) not"

16. Then they came
 To their father
 In the early part
 Of the night,
 Weeping.

17. They said: "O our father!
 We went racing with one another,
 And left Joseph with our things;
 And the wolf devoured him....
 But thou wilt never believe us
 Even though we tell the truth.

18. They stained his shirt
 With false blood. He said:

"Nay, but your minds
 Have made up a tale
 (That may pass) with you.
 (For me) patience is most fitting:
 Against that which ye assert,
 It is God (alone)
 Whose help can be sought"...

19. Then there came a caravan
 Of travellers: they sent
 Their water-carrier (for water),
 And he let down his bucket
 (Into the well)... He said:
 "Ah there! Good news!
 Here is a (fine) young man!"
 So they concealed him
 As a treasure! But God
 Knoweth well all that they do!

20. The (Brethren) sold him
 For a miserable price,--

For a few dirhams counted out:
 In such low estimation
 Did they hold him!

  

SECTION 3.

21. The man in Egypt
 Who bought him, said

To his wife: "Make his stay
 (Among us) honourable:
 Maybe he will bring us
 Much good, or we shall
 Adopt him as a son."
 Thus did We establish
 Joseph in the land,
 That We might teach him
 The interpretation of stories
 (And events). And God
 Hath full power and control
 Over His affairs; but most
 Among mankind know it not.

22. When Joseph attained
 His full manhood, We gave him

Power and knowledge: thus do We
 Reward those who do right.

23. But she in whose house
 He was, sought to seduce him
 From his (true) self: she fastened
 The doors, and said:
 "Now come, thou (dear one)!"
 He said: "God forbid!
 Truly (thy husband) is
 My lord! he made
 My sojourn agreeable!
 Truly to no good
 Come those who do wrong!"

24. And (with passion) did she
 Desire him, and he would
 Have desired her, but that
 He saw the evidence
 Of his Lord: thus
 (Did We order) that We
 Might turn away from him
 (All) evil and shameful deeds:

For he was one of Our servants,
 Sincere and purified.

25. So they both raced each other
 To the door, and she
 Tore his shirt from the back:
 They both found her lord
 Near the door. She said:
 "What is the (fitting) punishment
 For one who formed
 An evil design against
 Thy wife, but prison
 Or a grievous chastisement?"

26. He said: "It was she
 That sought to seduce me--
 From my (true) self." And one
 Of her household saw (this)
 And bore witness, (thus):--
 "If it be that his shirt
 Is rent from the front, then
 Is her tale true,
 And he is a liar!

27. "But if it be that his shirt
 Is torn from the back,

Then is she the liar,
 And he is telling the truth!"

28. So when he saw his shirt,--
 That it was torn at the back,
 (Her husband) said: "Behold!
 It is a snare of you women!
 Truly, mighty is your snare!

29. "O Joseph, pass this over!
 (O wife), ask forgiveness
 For thy sin, for truly
 Thou hast been at fault!"

  

SECTION 4.

30. Ladies said in the City:
 "The wife of the (great) 'Aziz
 Is seeking to seduce her slave
 From his (true) self:
 Truly hath he inspired her
 With violent love: we see
 She is evidently going astray."

31. When she heard
 Of their malicious talk,
 She sent for them
 And prepared a banquet
 For them: she gave
 Each of them a knife:
 And she said (to Joseph),
 "Come out before them."
 When they saw him,
 Thy did extol him,
 And (in their amazement)
 Cut their hands: they said,
 "God preserve us! no mortal
 Is this! This is none other
 Than a noble angel!"

32. She said: "There before you
 Is the man about whom
 Ye did blame me!
 I did seek to seduce him from
 His (true) self but he did
 Firmly save himself guiltless!...
 And now, if he doth not
 My bidding, he shall certainly
 Be cast into prison,
 And (what is more)
 Be of the company of the vilest!"

33. He said: "O my Lord!
 The prison is more
 To my liking than that
 To which they invite me:
 Unless Thou turn away
 Their snare from me,
 I should (in my youthful folly)
 Feel inclined towards them
 And join the ranks of the ignorant."

34. So his Lord hearkened to him
 (In his prayer), and turned
 Away from him their snare:
 Verily He heareth and knoweth
 (All things).

35. Then it occurred to the men,
 After they had seen the Signs,
 (That it was best)
 To Imprison him
 For a time.

  

SECTION 5.

36. Now with him there came
 Into the prison two young men.
 Said one of them: "I see
 Myself (in a dream)
 Pressing wine." Said the other:
 "I see myself (in a dream)
 Carrying bread on my head,
 And birds are eating thereof."
 "Tell us" (they said) "the truth
 And meaning thereof: for we
 See thou art one
 That doth good (to all)."

37. He said: "Before any food
 Comes (in due course)
 To feed either of you,
 I will surely reveal
 To you the truth
 And meaning of this
 Ere it befall you
 That is part of the (Duty)
 Which my Lord hath taught me.
 I have (I assure you)

Abandoned the ways
 Of a people that believe not
 In God and that (even)
 Deny the Hereafter.

38. "And I follow the ways
 Of my fathers,--Abraham,
 Isaac, and Jacob; and never
 Could we attribute any partners
 Whatever to God: that (comes)
 Of the grace of God to us
 And to mankind: yet
 Most men are not grateful

39. "O my two companions.
 Of the prison! (I ask you):
 Are many lords differing
 Among themselves better,
 Or the One God,
 Supreme and Irresistible?

40. "If not Him, ye worship nothing
 But names which ye have named,--
 Ye and your fathers,--
 For which God hath sent down
 No authority: the Command
 Is for none but God: He

Hath commanded that ye worship
 None but Him: that is
 The right religion, but
 Most men understand not...

41. "O my two companions
 Of the prison! As to one
 Of you, he will pour out
 The wine for his lord to drink:
 As for the other, he will
 Hang from the cross, and the birds
 Will eat from off his head.
 (So) hath been decreed
 That matter whereof
 Ye twain do enquire"...

42. And of the two,
 To that one whom he considered
 About to be saved, he said:
 "Mention me to thy lord."

But Satan made him forget
 To mention him to his lord:
 And (Joseph) lingered in prison
 A few (more) years.

  

SECTION 6.

43. The king (of Egypt) said:
 "I do see (in a vision)
 Seven fat kine, whom seven
 Lean ones devour,--and seven
 Green ears of corn, and seven (others)
 Withered. O ye chiefs!
 Expound to me my vision
 If it be that ye can
 Interpret visions."

44. They said: "A confused medley
 Of dreams: and we are not
 Skilled in the interpretation
 Of dreams."

45. But the man who had been
 Released, one of the two
 (Who had been in prison)
 And who now bethought him
 After (so long) a space of time,
 Said: "I will tell you
 The truth of its interpretation:
 Send ye me (therefor)."

46."O Joseph!" (he said).
 "O man of truth! Expound
 To us (the dream)
 Of seven fat kine
 Whom seven lean ones
 Devour, and of seven
 Green ears of corn
 And (seven) others withered:
 That I may return
 To the people, and that
 They may understand."

47. (Joseph) said: "For seven years
 Shall ye diligently sow

As is your wont:
 And the harvests that ye reap,
 Ye shall leave them in the ear,--
 Except a little, of which
 Ye shall eat.

48. "Then will come
 After that (period)
 Seven dreadful (years),
 Which will devour
 What ye shall have laid by
 In advance for them,--
 (All) except a little
 Which ye shall have
 (Specially) guarded.

49. "Then will come
 After that (period) a year
 In which the people will have
 Abundant water, and in which
 They will press (wine and oil)."

  

SECTION 7.

50. So the king said:
 "Bring ye him unto me."
 But when the messenger
 Came to him, (Joseph) said:
 "Go thou back to thy lord,
 And ask him, "What is
 The state of mind
 Of the ladies
 Who cut their hands?"
 For my Lord is
 Certainly well aware
 Of their snare."

51. (The king) said (to the ladies):
 "What was your affair
 When ye did seek to seduce
 Joseph from his (true) self?"
 The ladies said: "God
 Preserve us! no evil

Know we against him!"
 Said the 'Aziz's wife:
 "Now is the truth manifest
 (To all): it was I
 Who sought to seduce him
 From his (true) self:
 He is indeed of those
 Who are (ever) true (and virtuous).

52. "This (say I), in order that
 He may know that I
 Have never been false
 To him in his absence,
 And that God will never
 Guide the snare of the false ones.

53. "Nor do I absolve my own self
 (Of blame): the (human) soul
 Is certainly prone to evil,
 Unless my Lord do bestow
 His Mercy: but surely
 My Lord is Oft-Forgiving,
 Most Merciful."

54. So the king said:
 "Bring him unto me;
 I will take him specially
 To serve about my own person."
 Therefore when he had spoken
 To him, he said:
 "Be assured this day,
 Thou art, before our own Presence,
 With rank firmly established,
 And fidelity fully proved!

55. (Joseph) said: "Set me
 Over the store-houses
 Of the land: I will
 Indeed guard them,

As one that knows
 (Their importance)."

56. "Thus did we give
 Established power to Joseph
 In the land, to take possession
 Therein as, when, or where
 He pleased. We bestow
 Of Our mercy on whom
 We please, and We suffer not,
 To be lost, the reward
 Of those who do good.

57. But verily the reward
 Of the Hereafter
 Is the best, for those
 Who believe, and are constant
 In righteousness.

  

SECTION 8.

58. Then came Joseph's brethren:
 They entered his presence,
 And he knew them,
 But they knew him not.

59. And when he had furnished
 Them forth with provisions
 (Suitable) for them, he said:
 "Bring unto me a brother
 Ye have, of the same father
 As yourselves, (but a different mother):
 See ye not that I pay out
 Full measure, and that I
 Do provide the best hospitality?

60. "Now if ye bring him not
 To me, ye shall have
 No measure (of corn) from me,
 Nor shall ye (even) come
 Near me."

61. They said: "We shall
 Certainly seek to get
 Our wish about him
 From his father:
 Indeed we shall do it."

62. And (Joseph) told his servants
 To put their stock-in-trade
 (With which they had bartered)
 Into their saddle-bags,
 So they should know it only
 When they returned to their people,

In order that they
 Might come back.

63. Now when they returned
 To their father, they said:
 "O our father! No more
 Measure of grain shall we get
 (Unless we take our brother):
 So send our brother with us,
 That we may get our measure;
 And we will indeed
 Take every care of him."

64. He said: "Shall I trust you
 With him with any result
 Other than when I trusted you
 With his brother aforetime?
 But God is the best
 To take care (of him),
 And He is the Most Merciful
 Of those who show mercy!"

65. Then when they opened
 Their baggage, they found
 Their stock-in-trade had been
 Returned to them. They said:
 "O our father! What (more)
 Can we desire? This our
 Stock-in-trade has been returned
 To us: so we shall get

(More) food for our family;
 We shall take care of our brother;
 And add (at the same time)
 A full camel's load (of grain
 To our provisions).
 This is but a small quantity.

66. (Jacob) said: "Never will I
 Send him with you until
 Ye swear a solemn oath to me,
 In God's name, that ye
 Will be sure to bring him back
 To me unless ye are yourselves
 Hemmed in (and made powerless)."
 And when they had sworn
 Their solemn oath,
 He said: "Over all
 That we say, be God
 The Witness and Guardian!"

67. Further he said:
 "O my sons! enter not
 All by one gate: enter ye
 By different gates. Not that

I can profit you aught
 Against God (with my advice):
 None can command except God:
 On Him do I put my trust:
 And let all that trust
 Put their trust on Him."

68. And when they entered
 In the manner their father
 Had enjoined, it did not
 Profit them in the least
 Against (the Plan of) God:
 It was but a necessity
 Of Jacob's soul, which he
 Discharged. For he was,
 By Our instruction, full
 Of knowledge (and experience):
 But most men know not.

  

SECTION 9.

69. Now when they came
 Into Joseph's presence,
 He received his (full) brother
 To stay with him. He said
 (To him): "Behold! I am thy (own)
 Brother; so grieve not
 At aught of their doings."

70. At length when he had furnished
 Them forth with provisions
 (Suitable) for them, he put
 The drinking cup into
 His brother's saddle-bag.
 Then shouted out a Crier:
 "O ye (in) the Caravan!
 Behold! ye are thieves,
 Without doubt!"

71. They said, turning towards them:
 "What is it that ye miss?"

72. They said: "We miss
 The great beaker of the king;

For him who produces it,--
 Is (the reward of)
 A camel load; I
 Will be bound by it."

73. (The brothers) said: "By God!
 Well ye know that we
 Came not to make mischief
 In the land, and we are
 No thieves!"

74. (The Egyptians) said: "What then
 Shall be the penalty of this,
 If ye are (proved) to have lied?"

75. They said: "The penalty
 Should be that he
 In whose saddle-bag
 It is found, should be held
 (As bondman) to atone
 For the (crime). Thus it is
 We punish the wrong-doers!"

76. So he began (the search)
 With their baggage,

Before (he came to) the baggage
 Of his brother: at length
 He brought it out of his
 Brother's baggage. Thus did We
 Plan for Joseph. He could not
 Take his brother by the law
 Of the king except that God
 Willed it (so). We raise
 To degrees (of wisdom) whom
 We please: but over all
 Endued with knowledge is One,
 The All-Knowing.

77. They said: "If he steals,
 There was a brother of his
 Who did steal before (him)."
 But these things did Joseph
 Keep locked in his heart,
 Revealing not the secrets to them.

He (simply) said (to himself):
 "Ye are the worse situated;
 And God knoweth best
 The truth of what ye assert!"

78. They said: "O exalted one!
 Behold! he has a father,
 Aged and venerable, (who will
 Grieve for him); so take
 One of us in his place;
 For we see that thou art
 (Gracious) in doing good."

79. He said: "God forbid
 That we take other than him
 With whom we found
 Our property: indeed
 (If we did so), we should
 Be acting wrongfully.

  

SECTION 10.

80. Now when they saw
 No hope of his (yielding),
 They held a conference in private.
 The leader among them said:
 "Know ye not that your father
 Did take an oath from you
 In God's name, and how,
 Before this, ye did fail

In your duty with Joseph?
 Therefore will I not leave
 This land until my father
 Permits me, or God
 Commands me; and He
 Is the best to command.

81. "Turn ye back to your father,
 And say, "O our father!
 Behold! thy son committed theft!
 We bear witness only to what
 We know, and we could not
 Well guard against the unseen!

82. "Ask at the town where
 We have been and the caravan
 In which we returned,
 And (you will find) we are
 Indeed telling the truth."

83. Jacob said: "Nay, but ye
 Have yourselves contrived
 A story (good enough) for you.
 So patience is most fitting
 (For me). Maybe God will
 Bring them (back) all
 To me (in the end).
 For He is indeed full
 Of knowledge and wisdom.

84. And he turned away from them,
 And said: "How great
 Is my grief for Joseph!"
 And his eyes became white
 With sorrow, and he fell
 Into silent melancholy.

85. They said: "By God!
 (Never) wilt thou cease
 To remember Joseph
 Until thou reach the last
 Extremity of illness,
 Or until thou die!"

86. He said: "I only complain
 Of my distraction and anguish
 To God, and I know from God
 That which ye know not...

87. "O my sons! go ye
 And enquire about Joseph
 And his brother, and never
 Give up hope of God's
 Soothing Mercy: truly
 No one despairs of God's

Soothing Mercy, except
 Those who have no faith."

88. Then, when they came
 (Back) into (Joseph's) presence
 They said: "O exalted one!
 Distress has seized us
 And our family: we have
 (Now) brought but scanty capital:
 So pay us full measure,
 (We pray thee), and treat it
 As charity to us: for God
 Doth reward the charitable."

89. He said: "Know ye
 How ye dealt with Joseph
 And his brother, not knowing
 (What ye were doing)?"

90. They said: "Art thou indeed
 Joseph?" He said . "I am
 Joseph, and this is my brother:
 God has indeed been gracious

To us (all): behold, he that is
 Righteous and patient,--never
 Will God suffer the reward
 To be lost, of those
 Who do right."

91. They said: "By God! Indeed
 Has God preferred thee
 Above us, and we certainly
 Have been guilty of sin!"

92. He said: "This day
 Let no reproach be (cast)
 On you; God will forgive you,
 And He is the Most Merciful
 Of those who show mercy!

93. "Go with this my shirt,
 And cast it over the face
 Of my father: he will
 Come to see (clearly). Then come
 Ye (here) to me together
 With all your family."

  

SECTION 11.

94. When the Caravan left (Egypt),
 Their father said: "I do indeed
 Scent the presence of Joseph:
 Nay, think me not a dotard."

95. They said: "By God!
 Truly thou art in
 Thine old wandering mind."

96. Then when the bearer
 Of the good news came,
 He cast (the shirt)
 Over his face, and he
 Forthwith regained clear sight.
 He said: "Did I not say
 To you, "I know from God
 That which ye know not?"

97. They said: "O our father!
 Ask for us forgiveness
 For our sins, for we
 Were truly at fault."

98. He said: "Soon will I
 Ask my Lord for forgiveness
 For you: for He is indeed
 Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."

99. Then when they entered
 The presence of Joseph,
 He provided a home
 For his parents with himself,
 And said: "Enter ye
 Egypt (all) in safety
 If it please God."

100. And he raised his parents
 High on the throne (of dignity),
 And they fell down in prostration,
 (All) before him. He said:
 "O my father! this is
 The fulfilment of my vision
 Of old! God hath made it
 Come true! He was indeed
 Good to me when He
 Took me out of prison

And brought you (all here)
 Out of the desert,
 (Even) after Satan had sown
 Enmity between me and my brothers.
 Verily my Lord understandeth
 Best the mysteries of all
 that He planneth to do.
 For verily He is full
 Of knowledge and wisdom.

101."O my Lord! Thou hast
 Indeed bestowed on me
 Some power, and taught me
 Something of the interpretation
 Of dreams and events,--O Thou
 Creator of the heavens
 And the earth! Thou art
 My Protector in this world
 And in the Hereafter.
 Take Thou my soul (at death)
 As one submitting to Thy Will
 (As a Muslim), and unite me
 With the righteous."

102. Such is one of the stories
 Of what happened unseen,
 Which We reveal by inspiration
 Unto thee: nor wast thou
 (Present) with them when they
 Concerted their plans together
 In the process of weaving their plots.

103. Yet no faith will
 The greater part of mankind
 Have, however ardently
 Thou dost desire it.

104. And no reward dost thou ask
 Of them for this: it is
 No less than a Message
 For all creatures.

  

SECTION 12.

105. And how many Signs
 In the heavens and the earth

Do they pass by? Yet they
 Turn (their faces) away from them!

106. And most of them
 Believe not in God
 Without associating (others
 As partners) with Him!

107. Do they then feel secure
 From the coming against them
 Of the covering veil
 Of the wrath of God,
 Or of the coming against them
 Of the (final) Hour
 All of a sudden
 While they perceive not?

108. Say thou: "This is my Way:
 I do invite unto God,
 On evidence clear as
 The seeing with one's eyes,--

I and whoever follows me.
 Glory to God! and never
 Will I join gods with God!"

109. Nor did We send before thee
 (As apostles) any but men,
 Whom We did inspire,--
 (Men) living in human habitations.
 Do they not travel
 Through the earth, and see
 What was the end
 Of those before them?
 But the home of the Hereafter
 Is best, for those who do right.
 Will ye not then understand?

110. (Respite will be granted)
 Until, when the apostles
 Give up hope (of their people)
 And (come to) think that they
 Were treated as liars,
 There reaches them Our help,
 And those whom We will
 Are delivered into safety.
 But never will be warded off
 Our punishment from those
 Who are in sin.

111. There is, in their stories,
 Instruction for men endued

With understanding. It is not
 A tale invented, but a confirmation
 Of what went before it,--
 A detailed exposition
 Of all things, and a Guide
 And a Mercy to any such
 As believe.



  

Sura XIII.

  

Ra'd, or Thunder.



1. A. L. M. R. These are
 The Signs (or Verses)
 Of the Book: that which
 Hath been revealed unto thee
 From thy Lord is the Truth;
 But most men believe not.

2. God is He Who raised
 The heavens without any pillars
 That ye can see; is firmly
 Established on the Throne (of Authority);
 He has subjected the sun
 And the moon (to his Law)!
 Each one runs (its course)
 For a term appointed.
 He doth regulate all affairs,
 Explaining the Signs in detail,

That ye may believe with certainty
 In the meeting with your Lord.

3. And it is He Who spread out
 The earth, and set thereon
 Mountains standing firm,
 And (flowing) rivers: and fruit
 Of every kind He made
 In pairs, two and two:
 He draweth the Night as a veil
 O'er the Day. Behold, verily
 In these things there are Signs
 For those who consider!

4. And in the earth are tracts
 (Diverse though) neighbouring,
 And gardens of vines
 And fields sown with corn,
 And palm trees--growing
 Out of single roots or otherwise:
 Watered with the same water,
 Yet some of them We make
 More excellent than others to eat.
 Behold, verily in these things

There are Signs for those
 Who understand!

5. If thou dost marvel
 (At their want of faith),
 Strange is their saying:
 "When we are (actually) dust,
 Shall we indeed then be
 In a creation renewed?" They are
 Those who deny their Lord! They
 Are those round whose necks
 Will be yokes (of servitude):
 They will be Companions
 Of the Fire, to dwell therein
 (For aye)!

6. They ask thee to hasten on
 The evil in preference to the good:
 Yet have come to pass,
 Before them, (many) exemplary
 Punishments! But verily
 Thy Lord is full of forgiveness
 For mankind for their wrong-doing,
 And verily thy Lord
 Is (also) strict in punishment.

7. And the Unbelievers say:
 "Why is not a Sign sent down
 To him from his Lord?
 But thou art truly

A warner, and to every people
 A guide.

  

SECTION 2.

8. God doth know what
 Every female (womb) doth bear,
 By how much the wombs
 Fall short (of their time
 Or number) or do exceed.
 Every single thing is before
 His sight, in (due) proportion.

9. He knoweth the Unseen
 And that which is open:
 He is the Great,
 The most High.

10. It is the same (to Him)
 Whether any of you
 Conceal his speech or
 Declare it openly;
 Whether he lie hid by night
 Or walk forth freely by day.

11. For each (such person)
 There are (angels) in succession,
 Before and behind him:
 They guard him by command

Of God. Verily never
 Will God change the condition
 Of a people until they
 Change it themselves
 (With their own souls).
 But when (once) God willeth
 A people's punishment,
 There can be no
 Turning it back, nor
 Will they find, besides Him,
 Any to protect

12. It is He Who doth show you
 The lightning, by way
 Both of fear and of hope:
 It is He Who doth raise up
 The clouds, heavy
 With (fertilising) rain!

13. Nay, thunder repeateth His praises,
 And so do the angels, with awe:
 He flingeth the loud-voiced
 Thunder-bolts, and therewith
 He striketh whomsoever He will...
 Yet these (are the men)
 Who (dare to) dispute
 About God, with the strength
 Of His power (supreme)!

14. For Him (alone) is prayer
 In Truth: any others that they
 Call upon besides Him hear them
 No more than if they were
 To stretch forth their hands
 For water to reach their mouths
 But it reaches them not:
 For the prayer of those
 Without Faith is nothing
 But (futile) wandering (in the mind).

15. Whatever beings there are
 In the heavens and the earth
 Do prostrate themselves to God
 (Acknowledging subjection),--with good-will
 Or in spite of themselves:
 So do their shadows
 In the mornings and evenings.

16. Say: "Who is the Lord and Sustainer
 Of the heavens and the earth?"
 Say: "(It is) God."
 Say: "Do ye then take
 (For worship) protectors other
 Than Him, such as have
 No power either for good
 Or for harm to themselves?"
 Say: "Are the blind equal
 With those who see?
 Or the depths of darkness
 Equal with Light?"
 Or do they assign to God
 Partners who have created
 (Anything) as He has created,
 So that the creation seemed
 To them similar?
 Say: "God is the Creator
 Of all things: He is
 The One, the Supreme and
 Irresistible."

17. He sends down water
 From the sides, and the channels
 Flow, each according to its measure:
 But the torrent bears away
 The foam that mounts up
 To the surface. Even so,

Form that (ore) which they heat
 In the fire, to make ornaments
 Or utensils therewith,
 There is a scum likewise.
 Thus doth God (by parables)
 Show forth Truth and Vanity.
 For the scum disappears
 Like froth cast out;
 While that which is for the good
 Of mankind remains
 On the earth. Thus doth God
 Set forth parables.

18. For those who respond
 To their Lord, are (all)
 Good things. But those
 Who respond not to Him,
 Even if they had all
 That is in the heavens
 And on earth, and as much more,
 (In vain) would they offer it
 For ransom. For them
 Will the reckoning be terrible:
 Their abode will be Hell,----
 What a bed of misery!

  

SECTION 3.

19. Is then one who doth know
 That that which hath been

Revealed unto thee
 From thy Lord is the Truth,
 Like one who is blind?
 It is those who are
 Endued with understanding
 That receive admonition;--

20. Those who fulfil the Covenant
 Of God and fail not
 In their plighted word;

21. Those who join together
 Those things which God
 Hath commanded to be joined,
 Hold their Lord in awe,
 And fear the terrible reckoning;

22. Those who patiently persevere,
 Seeking the countenance of their Lord;
 Establish regular prayers; spend,
 Out of (the gifts) We have bestowed
 For their sustenance, secretly
 And openly; and turn off Evil
 With good: for such there is
 The final attainment
 Of the (Eternal) Home,--

23. Gardens of perpetual bliss:
 They shall enter there,
 As well as the righteous
 Among their fathers, their spouses,

And their offspring:
 And angels shall enter unto them
 From every gate (with the salutation):

24. "Peace unto you for that ye
 Persevered in patience! Now
 How excellent is the final Home!"

25. But those who break
 The Covenant of God, after
 Having plighted their word thereto,
 And cut asunder those things
 Which God has commanded
 To be joined, and work mischief
 In the land;--on them
 Is the Curse; for them
 Is the terrible Home!

26. God doth enlarge, or grant
 By (strict) measure, the Sustenance
 (Which He giveth) to whomso
 He pleaseth. (The worldly) rejoice
 In the life of this world:
 But the life of this world
 Is but little comfort
 In the Hereafter.

  

SECTION 4.

27. The Unbelievers say: "Why
 Is not a Sign sent down
 To him from his Lord?"
 Say: "Truly God leaveth,
 To stray, whom He will;
 But He guideth to Himself
 Those who turn to Him
 In penitence,--

28. "Those who believe, and whose hearts
 Find satisfaction in the remembrance
 Of God: for without doubt
 In the remembrance of God
 Do hearts find satisfaction.

29. "For those who believe
 And work righteousness,
 Is (every) blessedness,
 And a beautiful place
 Of (final) return."

30. Thus have We sent thee
 Amongst a People before whom
 (Long since) have (other) Peoples
 (Gone and) passed away;
 In order that thou mightest
 Rehearse unto them what We
 Send down unto thee by inspiration;

Yet do they reject (Him),
 The Most Gracious!
 Say: "He is my Lord!
 There is no god but He!
 On Him is my trust,
 And to Him do I turn!"

31. If there were a Qur-an
 With which mountains were moved,
 Or the earth were cloven asunder,
 Or the dead were made to speak,
 (This would be the one!)
 But, truly, the Command is
 With God in all things!'
 Do not the Believers know,
 That, had God (so) willed,
 He could have guided
 All mankind (to the Right)?

But the Unbelievers,--never
 Will disaster cease to seize
 Them for their (ill) deeds,
 Or to settle close to their homes,
 Until the promise of God
 Come to pass, for, verily,
 God will not fail
 In His promise.

  

SECTION 5.

32. Mocked were (many) apostles
 Before thee: but I granted
 Respite to the Unbelievers,
 And finally I punished them:
 Then how (terrible) was My requital!

33. Is then He Who standeth
 Over every soul (and knoweth)
 All that it doth,
 (Like any others)? And yet
 They ascribe partners to God.
 Say: "But name them!
 Is it that ye will
 Inform Him of something
 He knoweth not on earth,
 Or is it (just) a show
 Of words?" Nay! to those
 Who believe not, their pretence
 seems pleasing, but they are
 Kept back (thereby) from the Path.
 And those whom God leaves
 To stray, no one can guide.

34. For them is a Penalty
 In the life of this world,
 But harder, truly, is the Penalty
 Of the Hereafter: and defender
 Have they none against God.

35. The parable of the Garden
 Which the righteous are promised!--

Beneath it flow rivers:
 Perpetual is the enjoyment thereof
 And the shade therein:
 Such is the End
 Of the Righteous; and the End
 Of Unbelievers is the Fire.

36. Those to whom We have
 Given the Book rejoice
 At what hath been revealed
 Unto thee: but there are
 Among the clans those who reject
 A part thereof. Say:
 "I am commanded to worship
 God, and not to join partners
 With Him. Unto him
 Do I call, and
 Unto Him is my return."

37. Thus have We revealed it
 To be a judgment of authority

In Arabic. Wert thou to follow
 Their (vain) desires after the knowledge
 Which hath reached thee,
 Then wouldst thou find
 Neither protector nor defender
 Against God.

  

SECTION 6.

38. We did send apostles
 Before thee, and appointed
 For them wives and children:
 And it was never the part
 Of an apostle to bring a Sign
 Except as God permitted
 (Or commanded). For each period
 Is a Book (revealed).

39. God doth blot out
 Or confirm what He pleaseth:
 With Him is
 The Mother of the Book.

40. Whether We shall show thee
 (Within thy life-time)
 Part of what We promised them
 Or take to ourselves thy soul

(Before it is all accomplished),--
 Thy duty is to make
 (The Message) reach them:
 It is Our part
 To call them to account.

41. See they not that We
 Gradually reduce the land
 (In their control) from its
 Outlying borders ? (Where) God
 Commands, there is none
 To put back His command:
 And He is Swift
 In calling to account.

42. Those before them did (also)
 Devise plots; but in all things
 The master-planning is God's.
 He knoweth the doings
 Of every soul: and soon
 Will the Unbelievers know
 Who gets home in the End.

43. The Unbelievers say: "No apostle
 Art thou." Say: "Enough
 For a witness between me
 And you is God, and such
 As have knowledge of the Book."



  

Sura XIV.

  

Ibrahim, or Abraham.


1. A. L. R. A Book
 Which We have revealed
 Unto thee, in order that
 Thou mightest lead mankind
 Out of the depths of darkness
 Into light--by the leave
 Of their Lord--to the Way
 Of (Him) the Exalted in Power,
 Worthy of all Praise!--

2. Of God, to Whom do belong
 All things in the heavens
 And on earth!
 But alas for the Unbelievers
 For a terrible Penalty
 (Their Unfaith will bring them)!--

3. Those who love the life
 Of this world more than
 The Hereafter, who hinder (men)
 From the Path of God
 And seek therein something crooked:
 They are astray
 By a long distance.

4. We sent not an apostle
 Except (to teach) in the language
 Of his (own) people, in order
 To make (things) clear to them.
 Now God leaves straying
 Those whom He pleases
 And guides whom He pleases:
 And He is Exalted in Power,
 Full of Wisdom.

5. We sent Moses with Our Signs
 (And the command). "Bring out
 Thy people from the depths
 Of darkness into light,
 And teach them to remember
 The Days of God." Verily
 In this there are Signs
 For such as are firmly patient
 And constant,--grateful and appreciative.

6. Remember! Moses said
 To his people: "Call to mind
 The favour of God to you
 When He delivered you

From the people of Pharaoh:
 They set you hard tasks
 And punishments, slaughtered
 Your sons, and let your women-folk
 Live: therein was
 A tremendous trial from your Lord."

  

SECTION 2.

7. And remember! your Lord
 Caused to be declared (publicly):
 "If ye are grateful, I will
 Add more (favours) unto you;
 But if ye show ingratitude,
 Truly my punishment
 Is terrible indeed."

8. And Moses said: "If ye
 Show ingratitude, ye and all
 On earth together,--yet
 Is God Free of all wants,
 Worthy of all praise.

9. Has not the story
 Reached you, (O people!), of those
 Who (went) before you?--
 Of the People of Noah,
 And 'Ad, and Thamud?--
 And of those who (came)
 After them? None knows them
 But God. To them came

Apostles with Clear (Signs);
 But they put their hands
 Up to their mouths, and said:
 "We do deny (the mission)
 On which ye have been sent,
 And we are really
 In suspicious (disquieting) doubt
 As to that to which
 Ye invite us."

10. Their apostles said: "Is there
 A doubt about God,
 The Creator of the heavens
 And the earth? It is He
 Who invites you, in order
 That He may forgive you
 Your sins and give you
 Respite for a term appointed!"
 They said: "Ah! ye are
 No more than human,
 Like ourselves! Ye wish
 To turn us away from
 The (gods) our fathers
 Used to worship: then
 Bring us some clear authority."

11. Their apostles said to them:
 "True, we are human
 Like yourselves, but God
 Doth grant His grace

To such of His servants
 As He pleases. It is not
 For us to bring you
 An authority except as God
 Permits. And on God
 Let all men of faith
 Put their trust.

12. "No reason have we why
 We should not put our trust
 On God. Indeed He
 Has guided us to the Ways
 We (follow). We shall certainly
 Bear with patience all
 The hurt you may cause us.
 For those who put their trust
 Should put their trust on God."

  

SECTION 3.

13. And the Unbelievers said
 To their apostles: "Be sure
 We shall drive you out
 Of our land, or ye shall
 Return to our religion."
 But their Lord inspired
 (This Message) to them:
 "Verily We shall cause
 The wrong-doers to perish!

14. "And verily We shall
 Cause you to abide
 In the land, and succeed them.
 This for such as fear
 The Time when they shall stand
 Before My tribunal,--such
 As fear the Punishment denounced."

15. But they sought victory and decision
 (There and then), and frustration
 Was the lot of every
 Powerful obstinate transgressor.

16. In front of such a one
 Is Hell, and he is given,
 For drink, boiling fetid water.

17. In gulps will he sip it,
 But never will he be near
 Swallowing it down his throat:
 Death will come to him
 From every quarter, yet
 Will he not die: and
 In front of him will be
 A chastisement unrelenting.

18. The parable of those who
 Reject their Lord is that
 Their works are as ashes,
 On which the wind blows
 Furiously on a tempestuous day:
 No power have they over
 Aught that they have earned:
 That is the straying
 Far, far (from the goal).

19. Seest thou not that God
 Created the heavens and the earth
 In Truth? If He so will,
 He can remove you
 And put (in your place)
 A new Creation?

20. Nor is that for God
 Any great matter.

21. They will all be marshalled
 Before God together: then
 Will the weak say to those
 Who were arrogant, "For us,
 We but followed you; can ye
 Then avail us at all
 Against the Wrath of God?"
 They will reply, "If we
 Had received the guidance
 Of God, we should have
 Given it to you: to us
 It makes no difference (now)
 Whether we rage, or bear
 (These torments) with patience:
 For ourselves there is no way
 Of escape."

  

SECTION 4.

22. And Satan will say
 When the matter is decided:
 "It was God Who gave you
 A promise of Truth: I too
 Promised, but I failed
 In my promise to you.

I had no authority over you
 Except to call you, but ye
 Listened to me: then
 Reproach not me, but reproach
 Your own souls. I cannot listen
 To your cries, nor can ye
 Listen to mine. I reject
 Your former act in associating
 Me with God.
 For wrong-doers there must be
 A grievous Penalty."

23. But those who believe
 And work righteousness
 Will be admitted to Gardens
 Beneath which rivers flow,--
 To dwell therein for aye
 With the leave of their Lord.
 Their greeting therein
 Will be: "Peace!"

24. Seest thou not how
 God sets forth a parable?--
 A goodly Word
 Like a goodly tree,
 Whose root is firmly fixed,
 And its branches (reach)
 To the heavens,--

25. It brings forth its fruit
 At all times, by the leave

Of its Lord.
 So God sets forth parables
 For men, in order that
 They may receive admonition.

26. And the parable
 Of an evil Word
 Is that of an evil tree:
 It is torn up by the root
 From the surface of the earth:
 It has no stability.

27. God will establish in strength
 Those who believe, with the Word
 That stands firm, in this world
 And in the Hereafter; but God
 Will leave, to stray, those
 Who do wrong: God doeth
 What He willeth.

  

SECTION 5.

28. Hast thou not turned
 Thy vision to those who
 Have changed the favour of God.
 Into blasphemy and caused
 Their people to descend
 To the House of Perdition?--

29. Into Hell? They will burn
 Therein,--an evil place
 To stay in!

30. And they set up (idols)
 As equal to God, to mislead
 (Men) from the Path! Say:
 "Enjoy (your brief power)!
 But verily ye are making
 Straightway for Hell!"

31. Speak to my servants
 Who have believed,
 That they may establish
 Regular prayers, and spend
 (In charity) out of the Sustenance

We have given them,
 Secretly and openly, before
 The coming of a Day
 In which there will be
 Neither mutual bargaining
 Nor befriending.

32. It is God Who hath created
 The heavens and the earth
 And sendeth down rain
 From the skies, and with it
 Bringeth out fruits wherewith
 To feed you; it is He
 Who hath made the ships subject
 To you, that they may sail
 Through the sea by His Command;
 And the rivers (also)
 Hath He made subject to you.

33. And He hath made subject
 To you the sun and the moon,
 Both diligently pursuing
 Their courses; and the Night
 And the Day hath He (also)
 Made subject to you.

34. And He giveth you
 Of all that ye ask for.
 But if ye count the favours
 Of God, never will ye
 Be able to number them.
 Verily, man is given up
 To injustice and ingratitude.

  

SECTION 6.

35. Remember Abraham said:
 "O my Lord! make this city
 One of peace and security:
 And preserve me and my sons
 From worshipping idols.

36. "O my Lord! they have indeed
 Led astray many among mankind;
 He then who follows my (ways)
 Is of me, and he that
 Disobeys me,--but Thou
 Art indeed Oft-Forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

37. "O our Lord! I have made
 Some of my offspring to dwell
 In a valley without cultivation,
 By Thy Sacred House;

In order, O our Lord, that they
 May establish regular Prayer:
 So till the hearts of some
 Among men with love towards them,
 And feed them with Fruits:
 So that they may give thanks.

38. "O our Lord! truly Thou
 Dost know what we conceal
 And what we reveal:
 For nothing whatever is hidden
 From God, whether on earth
 Or in heaven.

39. "Praise be to God, Who hath
 Granted unto me in old age
 Isma'il and Isaac: for truly
 My Lord is He, the Hearer
 Of Prayer!

40. "O my Lord! make me
 One who establishes regular Prayer,
 And also (raise such)
 Among my offspring
 O our Lord!
 And accept Thou my Prayer.

41. "O our Lord! cover (us)
 With Thy Forgiveness--me,

My parents, and (all) Believers,
 On the Day that the Reckoning
 Will be established!

  

SECTION 7.

42. Think not that God
 Doth not heed the deeds
 Of those who do wrong.
 He but giveth them respite
 Against a Day when
 The eyes will fixedly stare
 In horror,--

43. They running forward
 With necks outstretched,
 Their heads uplifted, their gaze
 Returning not towards them,
 And their hearts a (gaping) void!

44. So warn mankind
 Of the Day when the Wrath
 Will reach them: then will
 The wrong-doers say: "Our Lord!
 Respite us (if only)
 For a short Term: we will
 Answer Thy Call, and follow
 The apostles!"
 "What! were ye not wont
 To swear aforetime that ye
 Should suffer no decline?

45. "And ye dwelt in the dwellings
 Of men who wronged their own
 Souls; ye were clearly shown
 How We dealt with them;
 And We put forth (many) Parables
 In your behoof!"

46. Mighty indeed were the plots
 Which they made, but their plots
 Were (well) within the sight
 Of God, even though they were
 Such as to shake the hills!

47. Never think that God would fail
 His apostles in His promise:
 For God is Exalted in Power,--
 The Lord of Retribution.

48. One day the Earth will be
 Changed to a different Earth,
 And so will be the Heavens,
 And (men) will be marshalled
 Forth, before God, the One,
 The Irresistible;

49. And thou wilt see
 The Sinners that day
 Bound together in fetters;--

50. Their garments of liquid pitch,
 And their faces covered with Fire;

51. That God may requite
 Each soul according
 To its deserts;
 And verily God is Swift
 In calling to account.

52. Here is a Message for mankind:
 Let them take warning therefrom,
 And let them know that He
 Is (no other than) One God
 Let men of understanding
 Take heed.



  

Sura XV.

  

Al-Hijr, or The Rocky Tract.


1. A. L. R. These are
 The Ayats of Revelation,--
 Of a Qur-an
 That makes things clear.

2. Again and again will those
 Who disbelieve, wish that they
 Had bowed (to God's Will)
 In Islam.

3. Leave them alone, to enjoy
 (The good things of this life)
 And to please themselves:
 Let (false) Hope amuse them: soon
 Will knowledge (undeceive them).

4. Never did We destroy
 A population that had not
 A term decreed and assigned
 Beforehand.

5. Neither can a people anticipate
 Its Term, nor delay it.

6. They say: "O thou to whom
 The Message is being revealed!
 Truly thou art mad (or possessed)!

7. "Why bringest thou not
 Angels to us if it be
 That thou hast the Truth?"

8. We send not the angels
 Down except for just cause:
 If they came (to the ungodly),
 Behold! no respite would they have!

9. We have, without doubt,
 Sent down the Message;
 And We will assuredly
 Guard it (from corruption).

10. We did send apostles before thee
 Amongst the religious sects
 Of old:

11. But never came an apostle
 To them but they mocked him.

12. Even so do we let it creep
 Into the hearts of the sinners--

13. That they should not believe
 In the (Message); but the ways

Of the ancients have passed away.

14. Even if We opened out to them
 A gate from heaven,
 And they were to continue
 (All day) ascending therein,

15. They would only say:
 "Our eyes have been intoxicated:
 Nay, we have been bewitched
 By sorcery."

  

SECTION 2.

16. It is We Who have set out
 The Zodiacal Signs in the heavens,
 And made them fair-seeming
 To (all) beholders;

17. And (moreover) We have guarded them

From every evil spirit accursed:

18. But any that gains a hearing
 By stealth, is pursued
 By a flaming fire, bright (to see).

19. And the earth We have spread out
 (Like a carpet); set thereon
 Mountains firm and immovable;
 And produced therein all kinds
 Of things in due balance.

20. And We have provided therein
 Means of subsistence,--for you
 And for those for whose sustenance
 Ye are not responsible.

21. And there is not a thing
 But its (sources and) treasures

(Inexhaustible) are with Us;
 But We only send down
 Thereof in due and ascertainable measures.

22. And We send the fecundating winds,
 Then cause the rain to descend
 From the sky, therewith providing
 You with water (in abundance),
 Though ye are not the guardians
 Of its stores.

23. And verily, it is We
 Who give life, and Who give
 Death: it is We Who remain Inheritors
 (After all else passes away).

24. To Us are known those of you
 Who hasten forward, and those
 Who lag behind.

25. Assuredly it is thy Lord
 Who will gather them together:
 For He is Perfect in Wisdom
 And Knowledge.

  

SECTION 3.

26. We created man from sounding clay,
 From mud moulded into shape;

27. And the Jinn race, We had
 Created before, from the fire
 Of a scorching wind.

28. Behold! thy Lord said
 To the angels: "I am about
 To create man, from sounding clay
 From mud moulded into shape;

29. "When I have fashioned him
 (In due proportion) and breathed
 Into him of My spirit,
 Fall ye down in obeisance
 Unto him.

30. So the angels prostrated themselves,
 All of them together:

31. Not so Iblis: he refused to be
 Among those who prostrated themselves.

32. (God) said: "O Iblis!
 What is your reason
 For not being among those
 Who prostrated themselves?"

33. (Iblis) said: "I am not one
 To prostrate myself to man,
 Whom Thou didst create
 From sounding clay, from mud
 Moulded into shape."

34. (God) said: "Then get thee out
 From here; for thou art
 Rejected, accursed.

35. "And the Curse shall be
 On thee till the Day of Judgment."

36. (Iblis) said: "O my Lord!
 Give me then respite
 Till the Day
 The (dead) are raised."

37. (God) said: "Respite
 Is granted thee--

38. "Till the Day
 Of the Time Appointed."

39. (Iblis) said: "O my Lord!
 Because Thou hast put me
 In the wrong, I will
 Make (wrong) fair-seeming
 To them on the earth,
 And I will put them
 All in the wrong,--

40. "Except Thy servants among them,
 Sincere and purified
 (By Thy grace)."

41. (God) said: "This (Way
 Of My sincere servants) is
 Indeed a Way that leads
 Straight to Me.

42. "For over My servants
 No authority shalt thou
 Have, except such as
 Put themselves in the wrong
 And follow thee."

43. And verily, Hell
 Is the promised abode
 For them all!

44. To it are seven Gates:
 For each of those Gates
 Is a (special) class
 (Of sinners) assigned.

  

SECTION 4.

45. The righteous (will be)
 Amid Gardens
 And fountains
 (Of clear-flowing water).

46. (Their greeting will be):
 "Enter ye here
 In Peace and Security."

47. And We shall remove
 From their hearts any
 Lurking sense of injury:
 (They will be) brothers
 (Joyfully) facing each other
 On thrones (of dignity).

48. There no sense of fatigue
 Shall touch them,
 Nor shall they (ever)
 Be asked to leave.

49. Tell My servants
 That I am indeed
 The Oft-Forgiving,
 Most Merciful;

50. And that My Penalty
 Will be indeed
 The most grievous Penalty.

51. Tell them about
 The guests of Abraham.

52. When they entered his presence
 And said, "Peace!"
 He said, "We feel
 Afraid of you!"

53. They said: "Fear not!
 We give thee glad tidings

Of a son endowed
 With wisdom."

54. He said: "Do ye give me
 Glad tidings that old age
 Has seized me? Of what,
 Then, is your good news?"

55. They said: "We give thee
 Glad tidings in truth:
 Be not then in despair!"

56. He said: "And who
 Despairs of the mercy
 Of his Lord, but such
 As go astray?"

57. Abraham said: "What then
 Is the business on which
 Ye (have come), O ye
 Messengers (of God)?"

58. They said: "We have been
 Sent to a people
 (Deep) in sin,

59. "Excepting the adherents
 Of Lut: them we are certainly

(Charged) to save (from harm),--
 All--

60. "Except his wife, who,
 We have ascertained,
 Will be among those
 Who will lag behind."

  

SECTION 5.

61. At length when the messengers
 Arrived among the adherents
 Of Lut,

62. He said: "Ye appear
 To be uncommon folk."

63. They said: "Yea,
 We have come to thee
 To accomplish that
 Of which they doubt.

64. "We have brought to thee
 That which is inevitably
 Due, and assuredly
 We tell the truth.

65. "Then travel by night
 With thy household,
 When a portion of the night
 (Yet remains), and do thou

Bring up the rear:
 Let no one amongst you
 Look back, but pass on
 Whither ye are ordered."

66. And We made known
 This decree to him,
 That the last remnants
 Of those (sinners) should be
 Cut off by the morning.

67. The inhabitants of the City
 Came in (mad) joy
 (At news of the young men).

68. Lut said: "These are
 My guests: disgrace me not:

69. "But fear God,
 And shame me not."

70. They said: "Did we not
 Forbid thee (to speak)
 For all and sundry?"

71. He said: "There are
 My daughters (to marry),
 If ye must act (so)."

72. Verily, by thy life (O Prophet),
 In their wild intoxication,

They wander in distraction,
 To and fro.

73. But the (mighty) Blast
 Overtook them before morning;

74. And We turned (the Cities)
 Upside down, and rained down
 On them brimstones
 Hard as baked clay.

75. Behold! in this are Signs
 For those who by tokens
 Do understand.

76. And the (Cities were)
 Right on the high-road.

77. Behold! in this
 Is a Sign
 For those who believe!

78. And the Companions of the Wood
 Were also wrong-doers;

79. So We exacted retribution
 From them. They were both
 On an open highway,
 Plain to see.

  

SECTION 6.

80. The Companions of the Rocky Tract
 Also rejected the apostles:

81. We sent them Our Signs,
 But they persisted
 In turning away from them.

82. Out of the mountains
 Did they hew (their) edifices,
 (Feeling themselves) secure.

83. But the (mighty) Blast
 Seized them of a morning,

84. And of no avail to them
 Was all that they did
 (With such art and care)!

85. We created not the heavens,
 The earth, and all between them,

But for just ends.
 And the Hour is surely
 Coming (when this will be manifest).
 So overlook (any human faults)
 With gracious forgiveness.

86. For verily it is thy Lord
 Who is the Master-Creator,
 Knowing all things.

87. And We have bestowed
 Upon thee the Seven
 Oft-repeated (Verses)
 And the Grand Qur-an.

88. Strain not thine eyes.
 (Wistfully) at what We
 Have bestowed on certain classes
 Of them, nor grieve over them:

But lower thy wing
 (in gentleness)
 To the Believers.

89. And say: "I am indeed he
 That warneth openly
 And without ambiguity,"--

90. (Of just such wrath)
 As We sent down
 On those who divided
 (Scripture into arbitrary parts),--

91. (So also on such)
 As have made Qur-an
 Into shreds (as they please).

92. Therefore, by the Lord,
 We will, of a surety,
 Call them to account,

93. For all their deeds.

94. Therefore expound openly
 What thou art commanded,
 And turn away from those
 Who join false gods with God.

95. For sufficient are We
 Unto thee against those

Who scoff,--

96. Those who adopt, with God,
 Another god: but soon
 Will they come to know.

97. We do indeed know
 How thy heart is distressed
 At what they say.

98. But celebrate the praises
 Of thy Lord, and be of those
 Who prostrate themselves
 In adoration.

99. And serve thy Lord
 Until there come unto thee
 The Hour that is Certain.



  

Sura XVI.

  

Nahl or The Bee.

1. (Inevitable) cometh (to pass)
 The Command of God:
 Seek ye not then
 To hasten it: glory to Him,
 And far is He above
 Having the partners
 They ascribe unto Him!

2. He doth send down His angels
 With inspiration of His Command,
 To such of His servants
 As He pleaseth, (saying):
 "Warn (Man) that there is
 No god but I: so do
 Your duty unto Me."

3. He has created the heavens
 And the earth for just ends:
 Far is He above having
 The partners they ascribe to Him!

4. He has created man
 From a sperm-drop;
 And behold this same (man)
 Becomes an open disputer!

5. And cattle He has created
 For you (men): from them
 Ye derive warmth,
 And numerous benefits,
 And of their (meat) ye eat.

6. And ye have a sense
 Of pride and beauty in them
 As ye drive them home
 In the evening, and as ye
 Lead them forth to pasture
 In the morning.

7. And they carry your heavy loads
 To lands that ye could not
 (Otherwise) reach except with
 Souls distressed: for your Lord
 Is indeed Most Kind, Most Merciful

8. And (He has created) horses,
 Mules, and donkeys, for you
 To ride and use for show;
 And He has created (other) things
 Of which ye have no knowledge.

9. and unto God leads straight
 The Way, but there are ways
 That turn aside: if God
 Had willed, He could have
 Guided all of you.

  

SECTION 2.

10. It is He Who sends down
 Rain from the sky:
 From it ye drink,
 And out of it (grows)
 The vegetation on which
 Ye feed your cattle.

11. With it He produces
 For you corn, olives,
 Date-palms, grapes,
 And every kind of fruit:
 Verily in this is a Sign
 For those who give thought.

12. He has made subject to you
 The Night and the Day;
 The Sun and the Moon;
 And the Stars are in subjection
 By His Command: verily
 In this are Signs
 For men who are wise.

13. And the things on this earth
 Which He has multiplied
 In varying colours
 (and qualities):
 Verily in this is a Sign
 For men who celebrate
 The praises of God
 (in gratitude).

14. It is He Who has made
 The sea subject, that ye
 May eat thereof flesh
 That is fresh and tender,
 And that ye may extract
 Therefrom ornaments to wear;
 And thou seest the ships
 Therein that plough the waves,
 That ye may seek (thus)
 Of the bounty of God
 And that ye may be grateful.

15. And He has set up
 On the earth mountains
 Standing firm, lest it should
 Shake with you; and rivers
 And roads; that ye
 May guide yourselves;

16. And marks and sign-posts;
 And by the stars
 (Men) guide themselves.

17. Is then He Who creates
 Like one that creates not?
 Will ye not receive admonition?

18. If ye would count up
 The favours of God,
 Never would ye be able
 To number them: for God
 Is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

19. And God doth know
 What ye conceal,
 And what ye reveal.

20. Those whom they invoke
 Besides God create nothing
 And are themselves created.

21. (They are things) dead,
 Lifeless: nor do they know
 When they will be raised up.

  

SECTION 3.

22. Your God is One God:
 As to those who believe not
 In the Hereafter, their hearts
 Refuse to know, and they
 Are arrogant.

23. Undoubtedly God doth know
 What they conceal,
 And what they reveal:
 Verily He loveth not the arrogant.

24. When it is said to them,
 "What is it that your Lord

Has revealed?" they say,
 "Tales of the ancients!"

25. Let them bear, on the Day
 Of Judgment, their own burdens
 In full, and also (something)
 Of the burdens of those
 Without knowledge, whom they
 Misled. Alas, how grievous
 The burdens they will bear!

  

SECTION 4.

26. Those before them did also
 Plot (against God's Way):
 But God took their structures
 From their foundations, and the roof
 Fell down on them from above;
 And the Wrath seized them
 From directions they did not perceive.

27. Then, on the Day of Judgment,
 He will cover them

With shame, and say:
 "Where are My "partners"
 Concerning whom ye used
 To dispute (with the godly)?"
 Those endued with knowledge
 Will say: "This Day, indeed,
 Are the Unbelievers covered
 With Shame and Misery,--

28. "(Namely) those whose lives the angels
 Take in a state of wrong-doing
 To their own souls."
 Then would they offer submission
 (With the pretence), "We did
 No evil (knowingly)." (The angels
 Will reply), "Nay, but verily
 God knoweth all that ye did;

29. "So enter the gates of Hell,
 To dwell therein.
 Thus evil indeed
 Is the abode of the arrogant."

30. To the righteous
 (When) it is said, "What
 Is it that your Lord
 Has revealed?" they say,
 "All that is good." To those
 Who do good, there is good
 In this world, and-the Home
 Of the Hereafter is even better

And excellent indeed is the Home
 Of the righteous,--

31. Gardens of Eternity which they
 Will enter: beneath them
 Flow (pleasant) rivers: they
 Will have therein all
 That they wish: thus doth
 God reward the righteous,--

32. (Namely) those whose lives
 The angels take in a state
 Of purity, saying (to them),
 "Peace be on you; enter ye
 The Garden, because of (the good)
 Which ye did (in the world)."

33. Do the (ungodly) wait until
 The angels come to them,
 Or there comes the Command
 Of thy Lord (for their doom)?
 So did those who went
 Before them. But God
 Wronged them not: nay,
 They wronged their own souls.

34. But the evil results
 Of their deeds overtook them,
 And that very (Wrath)
 At which they had scoffed
 Hemmed them in.

  

SECTION 5.

35. The worshippers of false gods
 Say: "If God had so willed,
 We should not have worshipped
 Aught but Him--neither we

Nor our fathers,--nor should
 We have prescribed prohibitions
 Other than His." So did those
 Who went before them.
 But what is the mission
 Of apostles but to preach
 The Clear Message?

36. For We assuredly sent
 Amongst every People an apostle,
 (With the Command), "Serve
 God, and eschew Evil":
 Of the people were some whom
 God guided, and some
 On whom Error became
 Inevitably (established). So travel
 Through the earth, and see
 What was the end of those
 Who denied (the Truth).

37. If thou art anxious
 For their guidance, yet
 God guideth not such
 As He leaves to stray,
 And there is none
 To help them.

38. They swear their strongest oaths
 By God, that God will not

Raise up those who die
 Nay, but it is a promise
 (Binding) on Him in truth:
 But most among mankind
 Realise it not.

39. (They must be raised up),
 In order that He may manifest
 To them the truth of that
 Wherein they differ, and that
 The rejecters of Truth
 May realise that they had
 Indeed (surrendered to)
 Falsehood.

40. For to anything which We
 Have willed, We but say
 The Word, "Be ", and it is.

  

SECTION 6.

41. To those who leave
 Their homes in the cause
 Of God, after suffering
 oppression,--
 We will assuredly give
 A goodly home in this world;
 But truly the reward
 Of the Hereafter will be greater.
 If they only realised (this)!

42. (They are) those who persevere
 In patience, and put
 Their trust on their Lord.

43. And before thee also
 The apostles We sent
 Were but men, to whom
 We granted inspiration: if ye
 Realise this not, ask of those
 Who possess the Message.

44. (We sent them) with Clear Signs
 And Books of dark prophecies;
 And We have sent down
 Unto thee (also) the Message;
 That thou mayest explain clearly
 To men what is sent
 For them, and that they
 May give thought.

45. Do then those who devise
 Evil (plots) feel secure
 That God will not cause
 the earth to swallow them up,
 Or that the Wrath will not
 Seize them from directions
 They little perceive?--

46. Or that He may not
 Call them to account

In the midst of their goings
 To and fro, without a chance
 Of their frustrating Him?--

47. Or that He may not
 Call them to account
 By a process of slow wastage--
 For thy Lord is indeed
 Full of kindness and mercy.

48. Do they not look
 At God's creation, (even)
 Among (inanimate) things,--
 How their (very) shadows
 Turn round, from the right
 And the left, prostrating
 Themselves to God, and that
 In the humblest manner?

49. And to God doth obeisance
 All that is in the heavens
 And on earth, whether
 Moving (living) creatures
 Or the angels: for none
 Are arrogant (before their Lord).

50. They all revere their Lord,
 High above them, and they do
 All that they are commanded.

  

SECTION 7.

51. God has said: "Take not
 (For worship) two gods:
 For He is just One God:
 Then fear Me (and Me alone)."

52. To Him belongs whatever
 Is in the heavens and on earth,
 And to Him is duty due always:
 Then will ye fear other
 Than God?

53. And ye have no good thing
 But is from God: and moreover,
 When ye are touched by distress,
 Unto Him ye cry with groans;

54. Yet, when He removes
 The distress from you, behold!
 Some of you turn to other gods
 To join with their Lord--

55. (As if) to show their ingratitude
 For the favours We have
 Bestowed on them! Then enjoy
 (Your brief day); but soon
 Will ye know (your folly)!

56. And they (even) assign,
 To things they do not know,
 A portion out of that
 Which We have bestowed
 For their sustenance!
 By God, ye shall certainly
 Be called to account
 For your false inventions.

57. And they assign daughters
 For God!--Glory be to Him!--
 And for themselves (sons,
 The issue) they desire!

58. When news is brought
 To one of them, of (the birth
 Of) a female (child), his face
 Darkens, and he is filled
 With inward grief!

59. With shame does he hide
 Himself from his people,

Because of the bad news
 He has had!
 Shall he retain it
 On (sufferance and) contempt,
 Or bury it in the dust?
 Ah! what an evil (choice)
 They decide on?

60. To those who believe not
 In the Hereafter, applies
 The similitude of evil:
 To God applies the highest
 Similitude: for He is
 The Exalted in Power,
 Full of Wisdom.

  

SECTION 8.

61. If God were to punish
 Men for their wrong-doing,
 He would not leave, on the (earth);
 A single living creature:
 But He gives them respite
 For a stated Term:
 When their Term expires,
 They would not be able
 To delay (the punishment)
 For a single hour, just as
 They would not be able
 To anticipate it (for a single hour).

62. They attribute to God
 What they hate (for themselves),
 And their tongues assert
 The falsehood that all good things
 Are for themselves: without doubt
 For them is the Fire, and they
 Will be the first to be
 Hastened on into it!

63. By God, We (also) sent
 (Our apostles) to Peoples
 Before thee; but Satan
 Made, (to the wicked),
 Their own acts seem alluring:
 He is also their patron to-day,
 But they shall have
 A most grievous penalty.

64. And We sent down the Book
 To thee for the express purpose,
 That thou shouldst make clear
 To them those things in which
 They differ, and that it should he
 A guide and a mercy
 To those who believe.

65. And God sends down rain
 From the skies, and gives therewith
 Life to the earth after its death:
 Verily in this is a Sign

For those who listen.

  

SECTION 9.

66. And verily in cattle (too)
 Will ye find an instructive Sign.
 From what is within their bodies,
 Between excretions and blood,
 We produce, for your drink,
 Milk, pure and agreeable
 To those who drink it.

67. And from the fruit
 Of the date-palm and the vine,
 Ye get out wholesome drink
 And food: behold, in this
 Also is a Sign
 For those who are wise.

68. And thy Lord taught the Bee
 To build its cells in hills,
 On trees, and in (men's) habitations;

69. Then to eat of all
 The produce (of the earth),
 And find with skill the spacious
 Paths of its Lord: there issues
 From within their bodies
 A drink of varying colours,
 Wherein is healing for men:
 Verily in this is a Sign
 For those who give thought.

70. It is God Who creates you
 And takes your souls at death;
 And of you there are
 Some who are sent back
 To a feeble age, so that
 They know nothing after
 Having known (much):
 For God is All-Knowing,
 All-Powerful.

  

SECTION 10.

71. God has bestowed His gifts
 Of sustenance more freely on some
 Of you than on others: those
 More favoured are not going
 To throw back their gifts
 To those whom their right hands
 Possess, so as to be equal
 In that respect. Will they then
 Deny the favours of God?

72. And God has made for you
 Mates (and Companions) of your own nature,
 And made for you, out of them,
 Sons and daughters and grandchildren,
 And provided for you sustenance
 Of the best: will they
 Then believe in vain things,
 And be ungrateful for God's favours?--

73. And worship others than God,--
 Such as have no power
 Of providing them, for sustenance,

With anything in heavens or earth,
 And cannot possibly have
 Such power?

74. Invent not similitudes
 For God: for God knoweth,
 And ye know not.

75. God sets forth the Parable
 (Of two men: one) a slave
 Under the dominion of another;
 He has no power of any sort;
 And (the other) a man
 On whom We have bestowed
 Goodly favours from Ourselves,
 And he spends thereof (freely),
 Privately and publicly:
 Are the two equal?
 (By no means;)
 Praise be to God. But
 Most of them understand not.

76. God sets forth (another) Parable
 Of two men: one of them
 Dumb, with no power
 Of any sort; a wearisome burden
 Is he to his master;
 Whichever way he directs him,
 He brings no good:
 Is such a man equal
 With one who commands

Justice, and is on
 A Straight Way?

  

SECTION 11.

77. To God belongeth the Mystery
 Of the heavens and the earth.
 And the Decision of the Hour
 (Of Judgment) is as
 The twinkling of an eye,
 Or even quicker:
 For God hath power
 Over all things.

78. It is He Who brought you
 Forth from the wombs
 Of your mothers when
 Ye knew nothing; and He
 Gave you hearing and sight
 And intelligence and affections:
 That ye may give thanks
 (To God).

79. Do they not look at
 The birds, held poised
 In the midst of (the air
 And) the sky? Nothing
 Holds them up but (the power
 Of) God. Verily in this
 Are Signs for those who believe.

80. It is God Who made your habitations
 Homes of rest and quiet
 For you; and made for you,
 Out of the skins of animals,
 (Tents for) dwellings, which
 Ye find so light (and handy)
 When ye travel and when
 Ye stop (in your travels);
 And out of their wool,
 And their soft fibres
 (Between wool and hair),
 And their hair, rich stuff
 And articles of convenience
 (To serve you) for a time.

81. It is God Who made.
 Out of the things He created,
 Some things to give you shade;
 Of the hills He made some
 For your shelter; He made you
 Garments to protect you
 From heat, and coats of mail
 To protect you from
 Your (mutual) violence.
 Thus does He complete
 His favours on you, that
 Ye may bow to His Will
 (In Islam).

82. But if they turn away,
 Thy duty is only to preach
 The Clear Message.

83. They recognise the favours
 Of God; then they deny them;
 And most of them
 Are (creatures) ungrateful.

  

SECTION 12.

84. One Day We shall raise
 From all Peoples a Witness:
 Then will no excuse be accepted
 From Unbelievers, nor will they
 Receive any favours.

85. When the wrong-doers
 (Actually) see the Penalty,
 Then will it in no way
 Be mitigated, nor will they
 Then receive respite.

86. When those who gave partners
 To God will see their "partners",

They will say: "Our Lord!
 These are our "partners," those
 Whom we used to invoke
 Besides Thee." But they will
 Throw back their word at them
 (And say): "Indeed ye are liars!"

87. That day shall they (openly) show
 (Their) submission to God; and all
 Their inventions shall leave
 Them in the lurch.

88. Those who reject God
 And hinder (men) from the Path
 Of God--for them
 Will We add Penalty
 To Penalty; for that they
 Used to spread mischief.

89. One day We shall raise
 From all Peoples a witness
 Against them, from amongst themselves:
 And We shall bring thee
 As a witness against these
 (Thy people): and We have sent down
 To thee the Book explaining
 All things, a Guide, a Mercy,
 And Glad Tidings to Muslims.

  

SECTION 13.

90. God commands justice, the doing
 Of good, and liberality to kith

And kin, and He forbids
 All shameful deeds, and injustice
 And rebellion: He instructs you,
 That ye may receive admonition.

91. Fulfil the Covenant of God
 When ye have entered into it,
 And break not your oaths
 After ye have confirmed them;
 Indeed ye have made
 God your surety; for God
 Knoweth all that ye do.

92. And be not like a woman
 Who breaks into untwisted strands
 The yarn which she has spun,
 After it has become strong
 Nor take your oaths to practise
 Deception between yourselves,
 Lest one party should be
 More numerous than another:
 For God will test you by this;
 And on the Day of Judgment

He will certainly make clear
 To you (the truth of) that
 Wherein ye disagree.

93. If God so willed, He
 Could make you all one People:
 But He leaves straying
 Whom He pleases, and He guides
 Whom He pleases: but ye
 Shall certainly be called to account
 For all your actions.

94. And take not your oaths,
 To practise deception between
 yourselves,
 With the result that someone's foot
 May slip after it was
 Firmly planted, and ye may
 Have to taste the evil
 (consequences)
 Of having hindered (men)
 From the Path of God,
 And a mighty Wrath
 Descend on you.

95. Nor sell the Covenant of God
 For a miserable price:
 For with God is (a prize)
 Far better for you,
 If ye only knew.

96. What is with you must vanish:
 What is with God will endure.
 And We will certainly bestow,
 On those who patiently persevere,
 Their reward according to
 The best of their actions.

97. Whoever works righteousness,
 Man or woman, and has Faith,
 Verily, to him will We give
 A new Life, a life
 That is good and pure, and We
 Will bestow on such their reward
 According to the best
 Of their actions.

98. When thou dost read
 The Qur-an, seek God's protection
 From Satan the Rejected One.

99. No authority has he over those
 Who believe and put their trust
 In their Lord.

100. His authority is over those
 Only, who take him as patron
 And who join partners with God.

  

SECTION 14.

101. When We substitute one revelation
 For another,--and God knows best
 What He reveals (in stages),--
 They say, "Thou art but a forger":
 But most of them understand not.

102. Say, the Holy Spirit has brought
 The revelation from thy Lord
 In Truth, in order to strengthen
 Those who believe, and as a Guide
 And Glad Tidings to Muslims.

103. We know indeed that they
 Say, "It is a man that.
 Teaches him." The tongue
 Of him they wickedly point to
 Is notably foreign, while this
 Is Arabic, pure and clear.

104. Those who believe not
 In the Signs of God,--
 God will not guide them,
 And theirs will be
 A grievous Penalty.

105. It is those who believe not
 In the Signs of God,
 That forge falsehood:
 It is they who lie!

106. Any one who, after accepting
 Faith in God, utters Unbelief,--
 Except under compulsion,
 His heart remaining firm
 In Faith--but such as
 Open their breast to Unbelief,--
 On them is Wrath from God,
 And theirs will be
 A dreadful Penalty.

107. This because they love
 The life of this world
 Better than the Hereafter:
 And God will not guide
 Those who reject Faith.

108. Those are they whose hearts,
 Ears, and eyes God has sealed up
 And they take no heed.

109. Without doubt, in the Hereafter
 They will perish.

110. But verily thy Lord,--
 To those who leave their homes
 After trials and persecutions,--
 And who thereafter strive
 And fight for the Faith
 And patiently persevere,
 Thy Lord, after all this
 Is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

  

SECTION 15.

111. One Day every soul
 Will come up struggling
 For itself, and every soul
 Will be recompensed (fully)
 For all its actions, and none
 Will be unjustly dealt with.

112. God sets forth a Parable:
 A city enjoying security
 And quiet, abundantly supplied
 With sustenance from every place:
 Yet was it ungrateful
 For the favours of God:
 So God made it taste
 Of hunger and terror (in extremes)
 (Closing in on it) like a garment
 (From every side), because

Of the (evil) which
 (Its people) wrought.

113. And there came to them
 An Apostle from among themselves,
 But they falsely rejected him;
 So the Wrath seized them
 Even in the midst
 Of their iniquities.

114. So eat of the sustenance
 Which God has provided
 For you, lawful and good;
 And be grateful for the favours
 Of God, if it is He
 Whom ye serve.

115. He has only forbidden you
 Dead meat, and blood,
 And the flesh of swine,
 And any (food) over which
 The name of other than God
 Has been invoked.
 But if one is forced by necessity,
 Without wilful disobedience,
 Nor transgressing due limits,--
 Then God is Oft-Forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

116. But say not--for any false thing
 That your tongues may put forth,--
 "This is lawful, and this
 Is forbidden," so as to ascribe
 False things to God. For those
 Who ascribe false things
 To God, will never prosper.

117. (In such falsehood)
 Is but a paltry profit;
 But they will have
 A most grievous Penalty.

118. To the Jews We prohibited
 Such things as We have
 Mentioned to thee before:
 We did them no wrong,
 But they were used to
 Doing wrong to themselves.

119. But verily thy Lord,--
 To those who do wrong
 In ignorance, but who
 Thereafter repent and make amends,--
 Thy Lord, after all this,
 Is Oft-Forgiving, Most
 Merciful.

  

SECTION 16.

120. Abraham was indeed a model,
 Devoutly obedient to God,
 (And) true in faith, and he
 Joined not gods with God:

121. He showed his gratitude
 For the favours of God,
 Who chose him, and guided him
 To a Straight Way.

122. And We gave him Good
 In this world, and he will be,

In the Hereafter, in the ranks
 Of the Righteous,''

123. So We have taught thee
 The inspired (message),
 "Follow the ways of Abraham
 The True in Faith, and he
 Joined not gods with God."

124. The Sabbath was only made
 (Strict) for those who disagreed
 (As to its observance);
 But God will judge between them
 On the Day of Judgment,
 As to their differences,

125. Invite (all) to the Way
 Of thy Lord with wisdom
 And beautiful preaching;
 And argue with them
 In ways that are best
 And most gracious:
 For thy Lord knoweth best,
 Who have strayed from His Path,

And who receive guidance.

126. And if ye do catch them out,
 Catch them out no worse
 Than they catch you out:
 But if ye show patience,
 That is indeed the best (course)
 For those who are patient.

127. And do thou be patient,
 For thy patience is but
 From God; nor grieve over them:
 And distress not thyself
 Because of their plots.

128. For God is with those
 Who restrain themselves,
 And those who do good.



  

Sura XVII.

  

Bani Isra-il, or the Children of Israel,



1. Glory to (God)
 Who did take His Servant
 For a Journey by night
 From the Sacred Mosque
 To the Farthest Mosque,
 Whose precincts We did
 Bless,--in order that We
 Might show him some
 Of Our Signs: for He
 Is the One Who heareth
 And seeth (all things).

2. We gave Moses the Book,
 And made it a Guide

To the Children of Israel,
 (Commanding): "Take not
 Other than Me
 As Disposer of (your) affairs."

3. O ye that are sprung
 From those whom We carried
 (In the Ark) with Noah!
 Verily he was a devotee
 Most grateful.

4. And We gave (clear) warning
 To the Children of Israel
 In the Book, that twice
 Would they do mischief
 On the earth and be elated
 With mighty arrogance
 (And twice would they be punished)!

5. When the first of the warnings
 Came to pass, We sent
 Against you Our servants
 Given to terrible warfare:
 They entered the very inmost
 Parts of your homes;
 And it was a warning
 (Completely) fulfilled.

6. Then did We grant you
 The Return as against them:
 We gave you increase
 In resources and sons,
 And made you
 The more numerous
 In man-power.

7. If ye did well,
 Ye did well for yourselves;
 If ye did evil,
 (Ye did it) against yourselves?
 So when the second
 Of the warnings came to pass,
 (We permitted your enemies)
 To disfigure your faces,
 And to enter your Temple
 As they had entered it before,
 And to visit with destruction
 All that fell into their power.

8. It may be that your Lord
 May (yet) show Mercy

Unto you; but if ye
 Revert (to your sins),
 We shall revert
 (To Our punishments):
 And We have made Hell
 A prison for those who
 Reject (all Faith),

9. Verily this Qur-an
 Doth guide to that
 Which is most right (or stable),
 And giveth the glad tidings
 To the Believers who work
 Deeds of righteousness,
 That they shall have
 A magnificent reward;

10. And to those who believe not
 In the Hereafter, (it announceth)
 That We have prepared
 For them a Penalty
 Grievous (indeed).

  

SECTION 2.

11. The prayer that man
 Should make for good,
 He maketh for evil;
 For man is given to
 Hasty (deeds).

12. We have made the Night
 And the Day as two

(Of Our) Signs: the Sign
 Of the Night have We obscured,
 While the Sign of the Day
 We have made to enlighten
 You; that ye may seek
 Bounty from your Lord,
 And that ye may know
 The number and count
 Of the years: all things
 Have We explained in detail.

13. Every man's fate
 We have fastened
 On his own neck:
 On the Day of Judgment
 We shall bring out
 For him a scroll,
 Which he will see
 Spread open.

14. (It will be said to him:)
 "Read thine (own) record:
 Sufficient is thy soul
 This day to make out
 An account against thee."

15. Who receiveth guidance,
 Receiveth it for his own
 Benefit: who goeth astray
 Doth so to his own loss:
 No bearer of burdens
 Can bear the burden
 Of another: nor would We
 Visit with Our Wrath
 Until We had sent
 An apostle (to give warning).

16. When We decide to destroy
 A population, We (first) send
 A definite order to those
 Among them who are given
 The good things of this life
 And yet transgress; so that
 The word is proved true
 Against them: then (it is)
 We destroy them utterly.

17. How many generations
 Have We destroyed. after Noah?
 And enough is thy Lord
 To note and see
 The sins of His servants

18. If any do wish
 For the transitory things
 (Of this life), We readily
 Grant them--such things
 As We will, to such persons
 As We will: in the end
 Have We provided Hell
 For them: they will burn
 Therein, disgraced and rejected.

19. Those who do wish
 For the (things of) the
 Hereafter,
 And strive therefor
 With all due striving,
 And have Faith,--
 They are the ones
 Whose striving is acceptable
 (To God).

20. Of the bounties of thy Lord
 We bestow freely on all--
 These as well as those:
 The bounties of thy Lord
 Are not closed (to anyone).

21. See how We have bestowed
 More on some than on others;
 But verily the Hereafter
 Is more in rank and gradation

And more in excellence.

22. Take not with God
 Another object of worship;
 Or thou (O man!) wilt sit
 In disgrace and destitution.'

  

SECTION 3.

23. Why Lord hath decreed
 That ye worship hone but Him,
 And that ye be kind
 To parents. Whether one
 Or both of them attain
 Old age in thy life,
 Say not to them a word
 Of contempt, nor repel them,
 But address them
 In terms of honour.

24. And, out of kindness,
 Lower to them the wing
 Of humility, and say:
 "My Lord! bestow on them
 Thy Mercy even as they
 Cherished me in childhood.

25. Your Lord knoweth best
 What is in your hearts:
 If ye do deeds of righteousness,
 Verily He is Most Forgiving
 To those who turn to Him
 Again and again
 (in true penitence).

26. And render to the kindred
 Their due rights, as (also)
 To those in want,
 And to the wayfarer:
 But squander not (your wealth)
 In the manner of a spendthrift.

27. Verily spendthrifts are brothers
 Of the Evil Ones;
 And the Evil One
 Is to his Lord (Himself)
 Ungrateful.

28. And even if thou hast
 To turn away from them
 In pursuit of the Mercy
 From thy Lord which thou
 Dost expect, yet speak
 To them a word
 Of easy kindness.

29. Make not thy hand tied
 (Like a niggard's) to thy neck,
 Nor stretch it forth
 To its utmost reach,
 So that thou become
 Blameworthy and destitute.

30. Verily thy Lord doth provide
 Sustenance in abundance
 For whom He pleaseth, and He
 Provideth in a just measure.
 For He doth know
 And regard all His servants.

  

SECTION 4.

31. Kill not your children
 For fear of want: We shall
 Provide sustenance for them
 As well as for you.
 Verily the killing of them
 Is a great sin.

32. Nor come nigh to adultery:
 For it is a shameful (deed)
 And an evil, opening the road
 (To other evils).

33. Nor take life--which God
 Has made sacred--except
 For just cause. And if
 Anyone is slain wrongfully,
 We have given his heir
 Authority (to demand Qisas
 Or to forgive): but let him
 Not exceed bounds in the matter
 Of taking life; for he
 Is helped (by the Law).

34. Come not nigh
 To the orphan's property
 Except to improve it,

Until he attains the age
 Of full strength; and fulfil
 (Every) engagement,
 For (every) engagement
 Will be enquired into
 (On the Day of Reckoning).

35. Give full measure when ye
 Measure, and weigh
 With a balance that is straight:
 That is the most fitting
 And the most advantageous
 In the final determination:

36. And pursue not that
 Of which thou hast
 No knowledge; for
 Every act of hearing,
 Or of seeing
 Or of (feeling in) the heart
 Will be enquired into
 (On the Day of Reckoning).

37. Nor walk on the earth
 With insolence: for thou

Canst not rend the earth
 Asunder, nor reach
 The mountains in height.

38. Of all such things
 The evil is hateful
 In the sight of thy Lord.

39. These are among the (precepts
 Of) wisdom, which thy Lord
 Has revealed to thee.
 Take not, with God,
 Another object of worship,
 Lest thou shouldst be thrown
 Into Hell, blameworthy and rejected.

40. Has then your Lord,
 (O Pagans!) preferred for you
 Sons, and taken for Himself
 Daughters among the angels?
 Truly ye utter
 A most dreadful saying!

  

SECTION 5.

41. We have explained (things)
 In various (ways) in this Qur-an,
 In order that they may receive
 Admonition, but it only increases
 Their flight (from the Truth)!

42. Say: if there had been
 (Other) gods with Him,--
 As they say,--behold,
 They would certainly have
 Sought out a way
 To the Lord of the Throne!

43. Glory to Him! He is high
 Above all that they say!--
 Exalted and Great (beyond measure)!

44. The seven heavens and the earth,
 And all beings therein,
 Declare His glory:
 There is not a thing
 But celebrates His praise;
 And yet ye understand not
 How they declare His glory!
 Verily He is Oft-Forbearing,
 Most Forgiving!

45. When thou dost recite
 The Qur-an, We put,

Between thee and those who
 Believe not to the Hereafter,
 A veil invisible:

46. And We put coverings
 Over their hearts (and minds)
 Lest they should understand
 The Our-an, and deafness
 Into their ears: when thou
 Dost commemorate thy Lord--
 And Him alone--in the Qur-an,
 They turn on their backs,
 Fleeing (from the Truth).

47. We know best why it is
 They listen, when they listen
 To thee; and when they
 Meet in private conference,
 Behold, the wicked say,
 "Ye follow none other than
 A man bewitched!"

48. See what similes they strike
 For thee: but they have gone
 Astray, and never can they
 Find a way.

49. They say: "What!
 When we are reduced

To bones and dust,
 Should we really be raised up
 (To be) a new creation?

50. Say: "(Nay!) be ye
 Stones or iron,

51. "Or created matter
 Which, in your minds,
 Is hardest (to be raised up),
 (Yet shall ye be raised up)!"
 Then will they say:
 "Who will cause us
 To return?" Say: "He
 Who created you first!"
 Then will they wag
 Their heads towards thee,
 And say, "When will
 That be?" Say, "May be
 It will be quite soon!

52. "It will be on a Day
 When He will call you,
 And ye will answer
 (His call) with (words
 Of) His praise, and ye
 Will think that ye tarried
 But a little while!

  

SECTION 6.

53. Say to My servants
 That they should (only) say
 Those things that are best:
 For Satan doth sow
 Dissensions among them:
 For Satan is to man
 An avowed enemy.

54. It is your Lord
 That knoweth you best:
 If He please, He granteth
 You mercy, or if He please,
 Punishment: We have not sent
 Thee to be a disposer
 Of their affairs for them.

55. And it is your Lord
 That knoweth best all beings
 That are in the heavens
 And on earth: We
 Did bestow on some Prophets
 More (and other) gifts
 Than on others: and We gave
 To David (the gift
 Of) the Psalms.

56. Say: "Call on those--
 Besides Him--whom ye fancy:
 They have neither the power
 To remove your troubles
 From you nor to change them."

57. Those whom they call upon
 Do desire (for themselves) means
 Of access to their Lord,--
 Even those who are nearest:
 They hope for His Mercy
 And fear His Wrath:
 For the Wrath of thy Lord
 Is something to take heed of

58. There is not a population
 But We shall destroy it
 Before the Day of Judgment
 Or punish it with
 A dreadful Penalty:
 That is written
 In the (eternal) Record.

59. And We refrain from sending
 The Signs, only because
 The men of former generations
 Treated them as false:

We sent the She-camel
 To the Thamud to open
 Their eyes, but they
 Treated her wrongfully:
 We only send the Signs
 By way of terror
 (And warning from evil).

60. Behold! We told thee
 That thy Lord doth encompass
 Mankind round about:
 We granted the Vision
 Which We showed thee,
 But as a trial for men,--
 As also the Cursed Tree
 (Mentioned) in the Qur-an:
 We put terror (and warning)
 Into them, but it only
 Increases their inordinate
 transgression!

  

SECTION 7.

61. Behold! We said to the angels:
 "Bow down unto Adam":
 They bowed down except Iblis
 He said, "Shall I bow down
 To one whom Thou didst create
 From clay?"

62. He said, "Seest Thou? This is
 The one whom Thou hast honoured
 Above me! If Thou wilt but
 Respite me to the Day
 Of Judgment, I will surely
 Bring his descendants
 Under my sway
 All but a few!"

63. (God) said: "Go thy way;
 If any of them follow thee,
 Verily Hell will be
 The recompense of you (all)--
 An ample recompense.

64. "Lead to destruction those
 Whom thou canst among them,
 With thy (seductive) voice;
 Make assaults on them
 With thy cavalry and thy
 Infantry; mutually share
 With them wealth and children;
 And make promises to them."
 But Satan promises them
 Nothing but deceit.

65. "As for My servants,
 No authority shalt thou
 Have over them:"
 Enough is thy Lord
 For a Disposer of affairs.

66. Your Lord is He
 That maketh the Ship
 Go smoothly for you
 Through the sea, in order that
 Ye may seek of His Bounty.
 For He is unto you
 Most Merciful.

67. When distress seizes you
 At sea, those that ye
 Call upon--besides Himself--
 Leave you in the lurch!
 But when He brings you back
 Safe to land, ye turn

Away (from Him). Most ungrateful
 Is man!

68. Do ye then feel secure
 That He will not cause you
 To be swallowed up
 Beneath the earth
 When ye are on land,
 Or that He will not send
 Against you a violent tornado
 (With showers of stones)
 So that ye shall find
 No one to carry out
 Your affairs for you?

69. Or do ye feel secure
 That He will not send you
 Back a second time
 To sea and send against you
 A heavy gale to drown you
 Because of your ingratitude,
 So that ye find no helper
 Therein against Us?

70. We have honoured the sons
 Of Adam; provided them
 With transport on land and sea;
 Given them for sustenance things
 Good and pure; and conferred
 On them special favours,
 Above a great part
 Of Our Creation.

  

SECTION 8.

71. One day We shall call
 Together all human beings
 With their (respective) Imams:
 Those who are given their record
 In their right hand
 Will read it (with pleasure),
 And they will not be
 Dealt with unjustly
 In the least.

72. But those who were blind
 In this world, will he
 Blind in the Hereafter,
 And most astray
 From the Path.

73. And their purpose was
 To tempt thee away
 From that which We
 Had revealed unto thee,
 To substitute in Our name
 Something quite different:
 (In that case), behold!
 They would certainly have
 Made thee (their) friend!

74. And had We not
 Given thee strength,

Thou wouldst nearly
 Have inclined to them
 A little.

75. In that case We should
 Have made thee taste
 An equal portion (of punishment)
 In this life, and an equal portion
 In death: and moreover
 Thou wouldst have found
 None to help thee against Us!

76. Their purpose was to scare
 Thee off the land,
 In order to expel thee;
 But in that case they
 Would not have stayed
 (Therein) after thee,
 Except for a little while.

77. (This was Our) way
 With the apostles We sent
 Before thee: thou wilt find
 No change in Our ways.

  

SECTION 9.

78. Establish regular prayers--
 At the sun's decline

Till the darkness of the night,
 And the morning prayer
 And reading: for the prayer
 And reading in the morning
 Carry their testimony.

79. And pray in the small watches
 Of the morning: (it would be)
 An additional prayer
 (Or spiritual profit)
 For thee: soon will thy Lord
 Raise thee to a Station
 Of Praise and Glory!

80. Say: "O my Lord!
 Let my entry be
 By the Gate of Truth
 And Honour, and likewise
 My exit by the Gate
 Of Truth and Honour;
 And grant me
 From Thy Presence
 An authority to aid (me).

81. And say: "Truth has (now)
 Arrived, and Falsehood perished:
 For Falsehood is (by its nature)
 Bound to perish."

82. We send down (stage by stage)
 In the Qur-an that which
 Is a healing and a mercy
 To those who believe:
 To the unjust it causes
 Nothing but loss after loss.

83. Yet when We bestow
 Our favours on man,
 He turns away and becomes
 Remote on his side (instead
 Of coming to Us), and when
 Evil seizes him he
 Gives himself up to despair!

84. Say: "Everyone acts
 According to his own disposition:
 But your Lord knows best
 Who it is that is
 Best guided on the Way."

  

SECTION 10.

85. They ask thee concerning
 The Spirit (of inspiration).
 Say: "The Spirit (cometh)
 By command of my Lord:
 Of knowledge it is only
 A little that is communicated
 To you, (O men!)"

86. If it were Our Will,
 We could take away
 That which We have
 Sent thee by inspiration
 Then wouldst thou find
 None to plead thy affair
 In that matter as against Us,--

87. Except for Mercy from thy Lord:
 For His Bounty is
 To thee (indeed) great.

88. Say: "If the whole
 Of mankind and Jinns
 Were to gather together
 To produce the like
 Of this Qur-an, they
 Could not produce
 The like thereof, even if
 They backed up each other

With help and support.

89. And We have explained
 To man, in this Qur-an,
 Every kind of similitude:
 Yet the greater part of men
 Refuse (to receive it)
 Except with ingratitude!

90. They say: "We shall not
 Believe in thee, until thou
 Cause a spring to gush
 Forth for us from the earth,

91. "Or (until) thou have
 A garden of date trees
 And vines, and cause rivers
 To gush forth in their midst,
 Carrying abundant water;

92. "Or thou cause the sky
 To fall in pieces, as thou
 Sayest (will happen), against us;

Or thou bring God
 And the angels before (us)
 Face to face;

93. "Or thou have a house
 Adorned with gold,
 Or thou mount a ladder
 Right into the skies.
 No, we shall not even believe
 In thy mounting until thou
 Send down to us a book
 That we could read."
 Say: "Glory to my Lord!
 Am I aught but a man,--
 An apostle?"

  

SECTION 11.

94. What kept men back
 From Belief when Guidance
 Came to them, was nothing
 But this: they said,
 "Has God sent a man
 (Like us) to be (His) Apostle?"

95. Say, "If there were settled,
 On earth, angels walking about

In peace and quiet, We should
 Certainly have sent them
 Down from the heavens
 An angel for an apostle."

96. Say: "Enough is God
 For a witness between me
 And you: for He is
 Well acquainted with His servants,
 And He sees (all things).

97. It is he whom God guides,
 That is on true guidance;
 But he whom He leaves
 Astray--for such wilt thou
 Find no protector besides Him.
 On the Day of Judgment
 We shall gather them together,
 Prone on their faces,
 Blind, dumb, and deaf:
 Their abode will be Hell:
 Every time it shows abatement,
 We shall increase for them
 The fierceness of the Fire.

98. That is their recompense,
 Because they rejected Our Signs,
 And said, "When we are reduced
 To bones and broken dust,
 Should we really be raised up
 (To be) a new Creation?"

99. See they not that God,
 Who created the heavens
 And the earth, has power
 To create the like of them
 (Anew)? Only He has
 Decreed a term appointed,
 Of which there is no doubt.
 But the unjust refuse
 (To receive it) except
 With ingratitude.

100. Say: "If ye had
 Control of the Treasures
 Of the Mercy of my Lord,
 Behold, ye would keep them
 Back, for fear of spending
 Them: for man
 Is (ever) niggardly!"

  

SECTION 12

101. To Moses We did give
 Nine Clear Signs:
 Ask the Children of Israel:
 When he came to them,
 Pharaoh said to him:
 "O Moses! I consider thee,

Indeed, to have been
 Worked upon by sorcery!

102. Moses said, "Thou knowest
 Well that these things
 Have been sent down by none
 But the Lord of the heavens
 And the earth as eye-opening
 Evidence: and I consider thee
 Indeed, O Pharaoh, to be
 One doomed to destruction!"

103. So he resolved to remove them
 From the face of the earth:
 But We did drown him
 And all who were with him.

104. And We said thereafter
 To the Children of Israel,
 "Dwell securely in the land
 (Of promise)": but when
 The second of the warnings came
 To pass, We gathered you
 Together in a mingled crowd

105. We sent down the (Qur-an)
 In Truth, and in Truth
 Has it descended: and We sent
 Thee but to give Glad
 Tidings and to warn (sinners).

106. (It is) a Qur-an
 Which We have divided
 (Into parts from time to time),
 In order that thou mightest
 Recite it to men
 At intervals: We have
 Revealed it by stages.

107. Say: "Whether ye believe
 In it or not, it is true
 That those who were given
 Knowledge beforehand, when
 It it recited to them,
 Fall down on their faces
 In humble prostration,

108. "And they say, "Glory
 To our Lord! Truly
 Has the promise of our Lord
 Been fulfilled!"

109. They fall down on their faces
 In tears, and it increases
 Their (earnest) humility!

110. Say: "Call upon God, or
 Call upon Rahman:
 By whatever name ye call
 Upon Him, (it is well):
 For to Him belong
 The Most Beautiful Names.
 Neither speak thy Prayer aloud,
 Nor speak it in a low tone,
 But seek a middle course
 Between."

111. Say: "Praise be to God,
 Who begets no son,
 And has no partner
 In (His) dominion:
 Nor (needs) He any
 To protect Him from
 humiliation:
 Yea, magnify Him
 For His greatness and glory!"



  

Sura XVIII.

  

Kahf, or the Cave.



1. Praise be to God,
 Who hath sent to His Servant
 The Book, and hath allowed
 Therein no Crookedness:

2. (He hath made it) Straight
 (And Clear) in order that
 He may warn (the godless)
 Of a terrible Punishment
 From Him, and that He
 May give Glad Tidings
 To the Believers who work
 Righteous deeds, that they
 Shall have a goodly Reward,

3. Wherein they shall
 Remain for ever:

4. Further; that He may warn
 Those (also) who say,

"God hath begotten a son"

5. No knowledge have they
 Of such a thing, nor
 Had their fathers. It is
 A grievous thing that issues
 From their mouths as a saying.
 What they say is nothing
 But falsehood!

6. Thou wouldst only, perchance,
 Fret thyself to death,
 Following after them, in grief,
 If they believe not
 In this Message.

7. That which is on earth
 We have made but as
 A glittering show for the earth,
 In order that We may test
 Them--as to which of them
 Are best in conduct.

8. Verily what is on earth
 We shall make but as

Dust and dry soil
 (Without growth or herbage).

9. Or dost thou reflect
 That the Companions of the Cave
 And of the Inscription
 Were wonders among Our Signs?

10. Behold, the youths betook themselves

To the Cave: they said,
 "Our Lord! bestow on us
 Mercy from Thyself,
 And dispose of our affair
 For us in the right way!"

11. Then We draw (a veil)
 Over their ears, for a number
 Of years, in the Cave,
 (So that they heard not):

12. Then We roused them,
 In order to test which
 Of the two parties was best
 At calculating the term
 Of years they had tarried!

  

SECTION 2.

13. We relate to thee their story
 In truth: they were youths
 Who believed in their Lord,
 And We advanced them In guidance:

14. We gave strength to their hearts:

Behold, they stood up
 And said: "Our Lord is
 The Lord of the heavens
 And of the earth: never
 Shall we call upon any god
 Other than Him: if we
 Did, we should indeed
 Have uttered an enormity!

15. "These our people have taken
 For worship gods other
 Than Him: why do they
 Not bring forward an authority
 Clear (and convincing)
 For what they do?
 Who doth more wrong
 Than such as invent
 A falsehood against God?

16. "When ye turn away
 From them and the things
 They worship other than God,
 Betake yourselves to the Cave:
 Your Lord will shower
 His mercies on you
 And dispose of your affair
 Towards comfort and ease."

17. Thou wouldst have seen
 The sun, when it rose,
 Declining to the right
 From their Cave, and when

It set, turning away
 From them to the left,
 While they lay in the open
 Space in the midst
 Of the Cave. Such are
 Among the Signs of God:
 He whom God guides
 Is rightly guided; but he
 Whom God leaves to stray,--
 For him wilt thou find
 No protector to lead him
 To the Right Way.

  

SECTION 3.

18. Thou wouldst have deemed them
 Awake, whilst they were asleep,
 And We turned them
 On their right and on
 Their left sides: their dog
 Stretching forth his two fore-legs
 On the threshold: if thou
 Hadst come up on to them,
 Thou wouldst have certainly
 Turned back from them in flight,
 And wouldst certainly have been
 Filled with terror of them.

19. Such (being their state),
 We raised them up (from sleep),
 That they might question
 Each other. Said one of them,

"How long have ye stayed (here)?"
 They said, "We have stayed
 (Perhaps) a day, or part
 Of a day." (At length)
 They (all) said, "God (alone)
 Knows best how long
 Ye have stayed here...
 Now send ye then one of you
 With this money of yours
 To the town: let him
 Find out which is the best
 Food (to be had) and bring some
 To you, that (ye may)
 Satisfy your hunger therewith:
 And let him behave
 With care and courtesy,
 And let him not inform
 Any one about you.

20. "For if they should
 Come upon you, they would
 Stone you or force you
 To return to their cult,
 And in that case ye would
 Never attain prosperity."

21. Thus did We make
 Their case known to the people,

That they might know
 That the promise of God
 Is true, and that there can
 Be no doubt about the Hour
 Of Judgment. Behold,
 They dispute among themselves
 As to their affair. (Some) said,
 "Construct a building over them":
 Their Lord knows best
 About them: those who prevailed
 Over their affair said,
 "Let us surely build a place
 Of worship over them."

22. (Some) say they were three,
 The dog being the fourth
 Among them; (others) say
 They were five, the dog
 Being the sixth,--doubtfully
 Guessing at the unknown;
 (Yet others) say they were
 Seven, the dog being the eighth.
 Say thou: "My Lord
 Knoweth best their number;
 It is but few that know
 Their (real case)." Enter not,
 Therefore, into controversies
 Concerning them, except
 On a matter that is clear,
 Nor consult any of them
 About (the affair of) the Sleepers.

  

SECTION 4.

23. Nor say of anything,
 "I shall be sure to do
 So and so to-morrow"--

24. Without adding, "So please God!"
 And call thy Lord to mind
 When thou forgettest, and say,
 "I hope that my Lord
 Will guide me ever closer
 (Even) than this
 To the right road."

25. So they stayed in their Cave
 Three hundred years, and (some)
 Add nine (more)

26. Say: "God knows best
 How long they stayed:
 With Him is (the knowledge
 Of) the secrets of the heavens
 And the earth: how clearly
 He sees, how finely He hears
 (Everything)! They have no protector
 Other than Him; nor does
 He share His Command
 With any person whatsoever.

27. And recite (and teach)
 What has been revealed
 To thee of the Book
 Of thy Lord: none
 Can change His Words,
 And none wilt thou find
 As a refuge other than Him.

28. And keep thy soul content
 With those who call
 On their Lord morning
 And evening, seeking
 His Face; and let not
 Thine eyes pass beyond them,
 Seeking the pomp and glitter
 Of this Life; nor obey
 Any whose heart We
 Have permitted to neglect
 The remembrance of Us,
 One who follows his own

Desires, whose case has
 Gone beyond all bounds.

29. Say, "The Truth is
 From your Lord":
 Let him who will,
 Believe, and let him
 Who will, reject (it):
 For the wrong-doers We
 Have prepared a Fire
 Whose (smoke and flames),
 Like the walls and roof
 Of a tent, will hem
 Them in: if they implore
 Relief they will be granted
 Water like melted brass,
 That will scald their faces.
 How dreadful the drink!
 How uncomfortable a couch
 To recline on!

30. As to those who believe
 And work righteousness,
 Verily We shall not suffer
 To perish the reward
 Of any who do
 A (single) righteous deed.

31. For them will be Gardens
 Of Eternity; beneath them
 Rivers will flow: they will
 Be adorned therein
 With bracelets of gold,
 And they will wear

Green garments of fine silk
 And heavy brocade;
 They will recline therein
 On raised thrones.
 How good the recompense!
 How beautiful a couch
 To recline on!

  

SECTION 5.

32. Set forth to them
 The parable of two men:
 For one of them We provided
 Two gardens of grape-vines
 And surrounded them
 With date palms;
 In between the two
 We placed corn-fields.

33. Each of those gardens
 Brought forth its produce,
 And failed not in the least
 Therein: in the midst
 Of them We caused
 A river to flow.

34. (Abundant) was the produce
 This man had: he said
 To his companion, in the course
 Of a mutual argument:
 "More wealth have I
 Than you, and more honour
 And power in (my following
 Of) men."

35. He went into his garden
 In a state (of mind)
 Unjust to his soul:
 He said, "I deem not
 That this will ever perish,

36. "Nor do I deem
 That the Hour (of Judgment)
 Will (ever) come:
 Even if I am brought back
 To my Lord, I shall
 Surely find (there)
 Something better in exchange."

37. His companion said to him,
 In the course of the argument
 With him: "Dost thou deny
 Him Who created thee
 Out of dust, then out of
 A sperm-drop, then fashioned
 Thee into a man?

38. "But (I think) for my part
 That He is God,
 My Lord, and none shall I
 Associate with my Lord.

39. "Why didst thou not,
 As thou wentest into
 Thy garden, say, "God's Will
 (Be done)! There is no power
 But with God!" If thou

Dost see me less than
 Thee in wealth and sons,

40. "It may be that my Lord
 Will give me something
 Better than thy garden,
 And that He will send
 On thy garden thunderbolts
 (By way of reckoning)
 From heaven, making it
 (But) slippery sand!--

41. "Or the water of the garden
 Will run off underground
 So that thou wilt never
 Be able to find it."

42. So his fruits (and enjoyment)
 Were encompassed (with ruin),
 And he remained twisting
 And turning his hands
 Over what he had spent
 On his property, which had
 (Now) tumbled to pieces
 To its very foundations,
 And he could only say,
 "Woe is me! Would I had
 Never ascribed partners
 To my Lord and Cherisher!"

43. Nor had he numbers
 To help him against God,
 Nor was he able
 To deliver himself.

44. There, the (only) protection comes
 From God, the True One.
 He is the Best to reward,
 And the Best to give success.

  

SECTION 6.

45. Set forth to them
 The similitude of the life
 Of this world: it is like
 The rain which We send
 Down from the skies:
 The earth's vegetation absorbs it,
 But soon it becomes
 Dry stubble, which the winds
 Do scatter: it is (only) God
 Who prevails over all things.

46. Wealth and sons are allurements
 Of the life of this world:
 But the things that endure,
 Good Deeds, are best
 In the sight of thy Lord,
 As rewards, and best
 As (the foundation for) hopes.

47. One Day We shall
 Remove the mountains, and thou
 Wilt see the earth
 As a level stretch,
 And We shall gather them,
 All together, nor shall We
 Leave out any one of them.

48. And they will be marshalled
 Before thy Lord in ranks,
 (With the announcement),
 "Now have ye come to Us
 (Bare) as We created you
 First: aye, ye thought
 We shall not fulfil
 The appointment made to you
 To meet (Us)!":

49. And the Book (of Deeds)
 Will be placed (before you);
 And thou wilt see
 The sinful in great terror
 Because of what is (recorded)
 Therein; they will say,
 "Ah! woe to us!
 What a book is this!
 It leaves out nothing
 Small or great, but
 Takes account thereof!"
 They will find all that they
 Did, placed before them:
 And not one will thy Lord
 Treat with injustice.

  

SECTION 7.

50. Behold! We said
 To the angels, "Bow down
 To Adam": they bowed down
 Except Iblis. He was
 One of the Jinns, and he
 Broke the Command
 Of his Lord.
 Will ye then take him
 And his progeny as protectors
 Rather than Me? And they
 Are enemies to you!
 Evil would be the exchange
 For the wrong-doers!

51. I called them not
 To witness the creation
 Of the heavens and the earth,
 Nor (even) their own creation:
 Nor is it for Me
 To take as helpers
 Such as lead (men) astray!

52. One Day He will say,
 "Call on those whom ye
 Thought to be My partners,"
 And they will call on them,
 But they will not listen
 To them; and We shall
 Make for them a place
 Of common perdition

53. And the Sinful shall see
 The Fire and apprehend
 That they have to fall
 Therein no means will they
 Find to turn away therefrom.

  

SECTION 8.

54. We have explained
 In detail in this Qur-an,
 For the benefit of mankind,
 Every kind of similitude:
 But man is, in most things,
 Contentious.

55. And what is there
 To keep back men
 From believing, now that
 Guidance has come to them,
 Nor from praying for forgiveness
 From their Lord, but that
 (They ask that) the ways
 Of the ancients be repeated
 With them, or the Wrath
 Be brought to them
 Face to face?

56. We only send the apostles
 To give glad tidings
 And to give warnings
 But the Unbelievers dispute
 With vain argument, in order
 Therewith to weaken the truth,
 And they treat My Signs
 As a jest, as also the fact
 That they are warned!

57. And who doth more wrong
 Than one who is reminded
 Of the Signs of his Lord,
 But turns away from them,
 Forgetting the (deeds) which his hands
 Have sent forth? Verily We
 Have set veils over their hearts
 Lest they should understand this,
 and over their ears, deafness.
 If thou callest them
 To guidance, even then
 Will they never accept guidance.

58. But your Lord is most forgiving,
 Full of Mercy. If he were
 To call them (at once) to account
 For what they have earned,
 then surely He would
 Have hastened their Punishment:
 But they have their appointed
 Time, beyond which they
 Will find no refuge.

59. Such were the populations
 We destroyed when they
 Committed iniquities; but
 We fixed an appointed time
 For their destruction.

  

Section 9.

60. Behold, Moses said
 To his attendant, "I will not
 Give up until I reach
 The junction of the two
 Seas or (until) I spend
 Years and years in travel."

61. But when they reached
 The Junction, they forgot
 (About) their Fish, which took
 Its course through the sea
 (Straight) as in a tunnel.

62. When they had passed on
 (Some distance), Moses said
 To his attendant: "Bring us
 Our early meal; truly
 We have suffered much fatigue
 At this (stage of) our journey."

63. He replied: "Sawest thou
 (What happened) when we
 Betook ourselves to the rock?
 I did indeed forget
 (About) the Fish: none but
 Satan made me forget
 To tell (you) about it:
 It took its course through
 The sea in a marvellous way!"

64. Moses said: "That was what
 We were seeking after:"
 So they went back
 On their footsteps, following
 (The path they had come).

65. So they found one
 Of Our servants,

On whom We had bestowed
 Mercy from Ourselves
 And whom We had taught
 Knowledge from Our own
 Presence.

66. Moses said to him:
 "May I follow thee,
 On the footing that
 Thou teach me something
 Of the (Higher) Truth
 Which thou hast been taught?"

67. (The other) said: "Verily
 Thou wilt not be able
 To have patience with me!

68. "And how canst thou
 Have patience about things
 About which thy understanding
 Is not complete?"

69. Moses said: "Thou wilt
 Find me, if God so will,
 (Truly) patient: nor shall I
 Disobey thee in aught."

70. The other said: "If then
 Thou wouldst follow me,
 Ask me no questions
 About anything until I
 Myself speak to thee
 Concerning it."

  

SECTION 10.

71. So they both proceeded:
 Until, when they were
 In the boat, he scuttled it.
 Said Moses: "Hast thou
 Scuttled it in order
 To drown those in it?
 Truly a strange thing
 Hast thou done!"

72. He answered: "Did I not
 Tell thee that thou canst
 Have no patience with me?"

73. Moses said: "Rebuke me not
 For forgetting, nor grieve me
 By raising difficulties
 In my case."

74. Then they proceeded:
 Until, when they met
 A young man, he slew him.
 Moses said: "Hast thou
 Slain an innocent person
 Who had slain none?
 Truly a foul (unheard-of) thing
 Hast thou done!"

75. He answered, "Did I not
 Tell thee that thou canst
 Have no patience with me?"

76. (Moses) said: "If ever I
 Ask thee about anything
 After this, keep me not
 In thy company: then wouldst
 Thou have received (full) excuse
 From my side.

77. Then they proceeded:
 Until, when they came
 To the inhabitants of a town,
 They asked them for food,
 But they refused them
 Hospitality. They found there
 A wall on the point of
 Falling down, but he
 Set it up straight.
 (Moses) said: "If thou
 Hadst wished, surely thou
 Couldst have exacted some
 Recompense for it!"

78. He answered: "This is
 The parting between me
 And thee: now will I
 Tell thee the interpretation
 Of (those things) over which
 Thou wast unable
 To hold patience.

79. "As for the boat,
 It belonged to certain
 Men in dire want:
 They plied on the water:

I but wished to render it
 Unserviceable, for there was
 After them a certain king
 Who seized on every boat
 By force.

80. "As for the youth,
 His parents were people
 Of Faith, and we feared
 That he would grieve them
 By obstinate rebellion
 And ingratitude (to God and man).

81. "So we desired that
 Their Lord would give them
 In exchange (a son)
 Better in purity (of conduct)
 And closer in affection.

82. "As for the wall,
 It belonged to two youths,
 Orphans, in the Town;
 There was, beneath it,
 A buried treasure, to which
 They were entitled; their father

Had been a righteous man:
 So thy Lord desired that
 They should attain their age
 Of full strength and get out
 Their treasure--a mercy
 (And favour) from thy Lord.
 I did it not of my own
 Accord. Such is the interpretation
 Of (those things) over which
 Thou wast unable
 To hold patience."

  

SECTION 11.

83. They ask thee concerning
 Zul-qarnain. Say,

"I will rehearse to you
 Something of his story."

84. Verily We established his power
 On earth, and We gave him
 The ways and the means
 To all ends.

85. One (such) way he followed,

86. Until, when he reached
 The setting of the sun,
 He found it set
 In a spring of murky water:
 Near it he found a People:
 We said: "O Zul-qarnain!
 (Thou hast authority,) either
 To punish them, or
 To treat them with kindness."

87. He said: "Whoever doth wrong,
 Him shall we punish; then
 Shall he be sent back
 To his Lord; and He will
 Punish him with a punishment
 Unheard-of (before).

88. "But whoever believes,
 And works righteousness,--

He shall have a goodly
 Reward, and easy will be
 His task as we order it
 By our command."

89. Then followed he (another) way,

90. Until, when he came
 To the rising of the sun,
 He found it rising
 On a people for whom
 We had provided
 No covering protection
 Against the sun.

91. (He left them) as they were:
 We completely understood
 What was before him.

92. Then followed he (another) way,

93. Until, when he reached
 (A tract) between two mountains,
 He found, beneath them, a people
 Who scarcely understood a word.

94. They said: "O Zul-qarnain!
 The Gog and Magog (people)
 Do great mischief on earth:
 Shall we then render thee
 Tribute in order that
 Thou mightest erect a barrier
 Between us and them?

95. He said: "(The power) in which
 My Lord has established me
 Is better (than tribute):
 Help me therefore with strength
 (And labour): I will
 Erect a strong barrier
 Between you and them:

96. "Bring me blocks of iron."
 At length, when he had
 Filled up the space between
 The two steep mountain-sides,
 He said, "Blow (with your bellows)"
 Then, when he had made
 It (red) as fire, he said:
 "Bring me, that I may
 Pour over it, molten lead."

97. Thus were they made
 Powerless to scale it
 Or to dig through it.

98. He said: "This is
 A mercy from my Lord:
 But when the promise
 Of my Lord comes to pass,
 He will make it into dust;
 And the promise of
 My Lord is true."

99. On that day We shall
 Leave them to surge
 Like waves on one another
 The trumpet will be blown,
 And We shall collect them
 All together.

100. And We shall present
 Hell that day for Unbelievers
 To see, all spread out,--

101. (Unbelievers) whose eyes
 Had been under a veil
 From Remembrance of Me,
 And who had been unable
 Even to hear.

  

SECTION 12.

102. Do the Unbelievers think
 That they can take
 My servants as protectors
 Besides Me? Verily We
 Have prepared Hell
 For the Unbelievers
 For (their) entertainment.

103. Say: "Shall we tell you
 Of those who lose most
 In respect of their deeds?--

104. "Those whose efforts have
 Been wasted in this life,
 While they thought that
 They were acquiring good
 By their works?"

105. They are those who deny
 The Signs of their Lord
 And the fact of their
 Having to meet Him
 (In the Hereafter): vain
 Will be their works,
 Nor shall We, on the Day
 Of Judgment, give them
 Any weight.

106. That is their reward,
 Hell; because they rejected
 Faith, and took My Signs
 And My Messengers
 By way of jest.

107. As to those who believe
 And work righteous deeds,
 They have, for their entertainment,
 The Gardens of Paradise,

108. Wherein they shall dwell
 (For aye): no change
 Will they wish for from them.

109. Say: "If the ocean were
 Ink (wherewith to write out)
 The words of my Lord,
 Sooner would the ocean be
 Exhausted than would the words
 Of my Lord, even if we
 Added another ocean
 Like it, for its aid."

110. Say: "I am but a man
 Like yourselves, (but)
 The inspiration has come
 To me, that your God is
 One God: whoever expects
 To meet his Lord, let him
 Work righteousness, and,
 In the worship of his Lord,
 Admit no one as partner.



  

Sura XIX.

  

Maryam, or Mary.



1. Kaf. Ha. Ya. 'Ain Sad.

2. (This is) a recital
 Of the Mercy of thy Lord
 To His servant Zakariya.

3. Behold! he cried
 To his Lord in secret,

4. Praying: "O my Lord!
 Infirm indeed are my bones,
 And the hair of my head
 Doth glisten with grey:
 But never am I unblest,
 O my Lord, in my prayer
 To Thee!

5. "Now I fear (what)
 My relatives (and colleagues)
 (Will do) after me:
 But my wife is barren:
 So give me an heir
 As from Thyself,--

6. "(One that) will (truly)
 "Represent me, and represent
 The posterity of Jacob;
 And make him, O my Lord!
 One with whom Thou art
 Well-pleased!"

7. (His prayer was answered):

"O Zakariya! We give thee
 Good news of a son:
 His name shall be Yahya:
 On none by that name
 Have We conferred distinction before."

8. He said: "O my Lord!
 How shall I have a son,
 When my wife is barren
 And I have grown quite decrepit
 From old age?"

9. He said: "So (it will be):
 Thy Lord saith, "That is
 Easy for Me: I did
 Indeed create thee before,
 When thou hadst been nothing!"

10. (Zakariya) said: "O my Lord!
 Give me a Sign."
 "Thy Sign," was the answer,
 "Shall be that thou
 Shalt speak to no man
 For three nights,
 Although thou art not dumb."

11. So Zakariya came out
 To his people
 From his chamber:
 He told them by signs
 To celebrate God's praises
 In the morning
 And in the evening.

12. (To his son came the command):
 "O Yahya! take hold

Of the Book with might":
 And We gave him Wisdom
 Even as a youth,

13. And pity (for all creatures)
 As from us, and purity:
 He was devout,

14. And kind to his parents,
 And he was not overbearing
 Or rebellious.

15. So Peace on him
 The day he was born,
 The day that he dies,
 And the day that he
 Will be raised up
 To life (again)

  

SECTION 2.

16. Relate in the Book
 (The story of) Mary,
 When she withdrew
 From her family
 To a place in the East.

17. She placed a screen
 (To screen herself) from them;
 Then We sent to her
 Our angel, and he appeared
 Before her as a man
 In all respects.

18. She said: "I seek refuge
 From thee to (God)
 Most Gracious: (come not near)
 If thou dost fear God."

19. He said: "Nay, I am only
 A messenger from thy Lord,
 (To announce) to thee
 The gift of a holy son."

20. She said: "How shall I
 Have a son, seeing that
 No man has touched me,
 And I am not unchaste?"

21. He said: "So (it will be):
 Thy Lord saith, "That is
 Easy for Me: and (We
 Wish) to appoint him
 As a Sign unto men
 And a Mercy from Us":

It is a matter
 (So) decreed."

22. So she conceived him,
 And she retired with him
 To a remote place.

23. And the pains of childbirth
 Drove her to the trunk
 Of a palm-tree:
 She cried (in her anguish):
 "Ah! would that I had
 Died before this! would that
 I had been a thing
 Forgotten and out of sight!"

24. But (a voice) cried to her
 From beneath the (palm-tree):
 "Grieve not! for thy Lord
 Hath provided a rivulet
 Beneath thee;

25. "And shake towards thyself
 The trunk of the palm-tree:
 It will let fall
 Fresh ripe dates upon thee

26. "So eat and drink
 And cool (thine) eye.
 And if thou dost see
 Any man, say, 'I have

Vowed a fast to (God)
 Most Gracious, and this day
 Will I enter into no talk
 With any human being'"

27. At length she brought
 The (babe) to her people,
 Carrying him (in her arms).
 They said: "O Mary!
 Truly an amazing thing
 Hast thou brought!

28. "O sister of Aaron!
 Thy father was not
 A man of evil, nor thy
 Mother a woman unchaste!"

29. But she pointed to the babe.
 They said: "How can we
 Talk to one who is
 A child in the cradle?"

30. He said: "I am indeed
 A servant of God:
 He hath given me
 Revelation and made me
 A prophet;

31. "And He hath made me
 Blessed wheresoever I be,

And hath enjoined on me
 Prayer and Charity as long
 As I live;

32. "(He) hath made me kind
 To my mother, and not
 Overbearing or miserable;

33. "So Peace is on me
 The day I was born,
 The day that I die,
 And the day that I
 Shall be raised up
 To life (again)"!

34. Such (was) Jesus the son
 Of Mary: (it is) a statement
 Of truth, about which
 They (vainly) dispute.

35. It is not befitting
 To (the majesty of) God
 That He should beget
 A son. Glory be to Him!
 When He determines
 A matter, He only says
 To it, "Be", and it is.

36. Verily God is my Lord
 And your Lord: Him

Therefore serve ye: this is
 A Way that is straight.

37. But the sects differ
 Among themselves: and woe
 To the Unbelievers because
 Of the (coming) Judgment
 Of a momentous Day!

38. How plainly will they see
 And hear, the Day that
 They will appear before Us!
 But the unjust to-day
 Are in error manifest!

39. But warn them of the Day
 Of Distress, when
 The matter will be determined:
 For (behold,) they are negligent
 And they do not believe!

40. It is We Who will inherit
 The earth, and all beings
 Thereon: to Us will they
 All be returned.

  

SECTION 3.

41. (Also) mention in the Book
 (The story of) Abraham:
 He was a man of Truth,
 A prophet.

42. Behold, he said to his father:
 "O my father! why
 Worship that which heareth not
 And seeth not, and can
 Profit thee nothing?

43. "O my father! to me
 Hath come knowledge which
 Hath not reached thee:
 So follow me: I will guide
 Thee to a Way that
 Is even and straight.

44. "O my father! serve not
 Satan: for Satan is
 A rebel against (God)
 Most Gracious

45. "O my father! I fear
 Lest a Penalty afflict thee
 From (God) Most Gracious,
 So that thou become
 To Satan a friend."

46. (The father) replied: "Dost thou
 Hate my gods, O Abraham?
 If thou forbear not, I will
 Indeed stone thee:
 Now get away from me
 For a good long while!"

47. Abraham said: "Peace be
 On thee: I will pray
 To my Lord for thy
 forgiveness:
 For He is to me
 Most Gracious.

48. "And I will turn away
 From you (all) and from those
 Whom ye invoke besides God:
 I will call on my Lord:
 Perhaps, by my prayer to my Lord,
 I shall be not unblest."

49. When he had turned away
 From them and from those
 Whom they worshipped besides
 God, We bestowed on him
 Isaac and Jacob, and each one
 Of them We made a prophet.

50. And We bestowed
 Of Our Mercy on them,
 And We granted them
 Lofty honour on the tongue
 Of truth.

  

SECTION 4.

51. Also mention in the Book
 (The story of) Moses:
 For he was specially chosen,
 And he was an apostle
 (And) a prophet.

52. And We called him
 From the right side
 Of Mount (Sinai), and made
 Him draw near to Us,
 For mystic (converse).

53. And, out of Our Mercy,
 We gave him his brother
 Aaron, (also.) a prophet.

54. Also mention in the Book
 (The story of) Isma'il
 He was (strictly) true
 To what he promised,
 And he was an apostle
 (And) a prophet.

55. He used to enjoin
 On his people Prayer
 And Charity, and he was
 Most acceptable in the sight
 Of his Lord.

56. Also mention in the Book
 The case of Idris
 He was a man of truth
 (And sincerity), (and) a prophet:

57. And We raised him
 To a lofty station.

58. Those were some
 Of the prophets on whom
 God did bestow His Grace,--
 Of the posterity of Adam,
 And of those whom We
 Carried (in the Ark)
 With Noah, and of
 The posterity of Abraham
 And Israel--of those
 Whom We guided and chose.

Whenever the Signs
 Of (God) Most Gracious
 Were rehearsed to them,
 They would fall down
 In prostrate adoration
 And in tears.

59. But after them there followed
 A posterity who missed
 Prayers and followed after lusts
 Soon, then, will they
 Face Destruction,--

60. Except those who repent
 And believe, and work
 Righteousness: for these
 Will enter the Garden
 And will not be wronged
 In the least,--

61. Gardens of Eternity, those
 Which (God) Most Gracious
 Has promised to His servants
 In the Unseen: for His promise
 Must (necessarily) come to pass.

62. They will not there hear
 Any vain discourse, but
 Only salutations of Peace:
 And they will have therein
 Their sustenance, morning
 And evening.

63. Such is the Garden which
 We give as an inheritance
 To those of Our servants
 Who guard against evil.

64. (The angels say:)
 "We descend not but
 By command of thy Lord:
 To Him belongeth what is
 Before us and what is
 Behind us, and what is
 Between: and thy Lord
 Never doth forget,--

65. "Lord of the heavens
 And of the earth,
 And of all that is
 Between them: so worship Him,
 And be constant and patient
 In His worship: knowest thou
 Of any who is worthy
 Of the same Name as He?"

  

SECTION 5.

66. Man says: "What!
 When I am dead, shall I
 Then be raised up alive?"

67. But does not man
 Call to mind that We
 Created him before
 Out of nothing?

68. So, by thy Lord,
 Without doubt, We shall gather
 Them together, and (also)
 The Evil Ones (with them);
 Then shall We bring them
 Forth on their knees
 Round about Hell;

69. Then shall We certainly
 Drag out from every sect
 All those who were worst
 In obstinate rebellion
 Against (God) Most Gracious.

70. And certainly We know best
 Those who are most worthy
 Of being burned therein.

71. Not one of you but will
 Pass over it: this is,
 With thy Lord, a Decree
 Which must be accomplished.

72. But We shall save those
 Who guarded against evil,
 And We shall leave
 The wrong-doers therein,
 (Humbled) to their knees.

73. When Our Clear Signs
 Are rehearsed to them,
 The Unbelievers say to those
 Who believe, "Which of the two
 Sides is best in point of
 Position? which makes the best
 Show in Council?"

74. But how many (countless)
 Generations before them
 Have We destroyed,
 Who were even better
 In equipment and in glitter
 To the eye?

75. Say: "If any men go
 Astray, (God) Most Gracious
 Extends (the rope) to them,
 Until, when they see
 The warning of God (being
 Fulfilled)--either in punishment
 Or in (the approach of)
 The Hour,--they will
 At length realise who is
 Worst in position, and (who)
 Weakest in forces!

76. "And God doth advance
 In guidance those who seek
 Guidance: and the things
 That endure, Good Deeds,
 Are best in the sight
 Of thy Lord, as rewards,
 And best in respect of
 (Their) eventual returns."

77. Hast thou then seen
 The (sort of) man who
 Rejects Our Signs, yet
 Says: "I shall certainly
 Be given wealth and children?"

78. Has he penetrated to
 The Unseen, or has he
 Taken a contract with
 (God) Most Gracious?

79. Nay! We shall record
 What he says, and We
 Shall add and add
 To his punishment.

80. To Us shall return
 All that he talks of,
 And he shall appear
 Before Us bare and alone.

81. And they have taken
 (For worship) gods other than
 God, to give them
 Power and glory!

82. Instead, they shall reject
 Their worship, and become
 Adversaries against them.

  

SECTION 6.

83. Seest thou not that We
 Have set the Evil Ones on
 Against the Unbelievers,
 To incite them with fury?

84. So make no haste
 Against them, for We
 But count out to them
 A (limited) number (of days).

85. The day We shall gather
 The righteous to (God)
 Most Gracious, like a hand
 Presented before a king for honours,

86. And We shall drive
 The sinners to hell,
 Like thirsty cattle
 Driven down to water,--

87. None shall have the power
 Of intercession, but such a one
 As has received permission (or promise)
 From (God) Most Gracious.

88. They say: "(God) Most Gracious
 Has begotten a son!"

89. Indeed ye have put forth
 A thing most monstrous!

90. At it the skies are ready
 To burst, the earth
 To split asunder, and
 The mountains to fall down
 In utter ruin,

91. That they should invoke
 A son for (God) Most Gracious.

92. For it is not consonant
 With the majesty of (God)
 Most Gracious that He
 Should beget a son.

93. Not one of the beings
 In the heavens and the earth
 But must come to (God)
 Most Gracious as a servant.

94. He does take an account
 Of them (all), and hath
 Numbered them (all) exactly.

95. And everyone of them
 Will come to Him singly
 On the Day of Judgment.

96. On those who believe
 And work deeds of righteousness,
 Will (God) Most Gracious
 Bestow Love.

97. So have We made
 The (Qur-an) easy
 In thine own tongue,
 That with it thou mayest give

Glad tidings to the righteous,
 And warnings to people
 Given to contention.

98. But how many (countless)
 Generations before them
 Have We destroyed? Canst thou
 Find a single one of them
 (Now) or hear. (so much
 As) a whisper of them?



  

Sura XX.

  

Ta-Ha. (Mystic Letters, T. H.)



1. Ta-Ha.

2. We have not sent down
 The Qur-an to thee to be
 (An occasion) for thy distress,

3. But only as an admonition
 To those who fear (God),--

4. A revelation from Him
 Who created the earth
 And the heavens on high.

5. (God) Most Gracious
 Is firmly established
 On the throne (of authority).

6. To Him belongs what is
 In the heavens and on earth,
 And all between them,
 And all beneath the soil.

7. If thou pronounce the word
 Aloud, (it is no matter):

For verily He knoweth
 What is secret and what
 Is yet more hidden.

8. God! there is no god
 But He! To Him belong
 The Most Beautiful Names.

9. Has the story of Moses
 Reached thee?

10. Behold, he saw a fire:
 So he said to his family,

"Tarry ye; I perceive
 A fire; perhaps I can
 Bring you some burning brand
 Therefrom, or find some guidance
 At the fire."

11. But when he came
 To the fire, a voice
 Was heard: "O Moses!

12. "Verily I am thy Lord!
 Therefore (in My presence)
 Put off thy shoes: thou art
 In the sacred valley Tuwa

13. "I have chosen thee:
 Listen, then, to the inspiration
 (Sent to thee).

14. "Verily, I am God:
 There is no god but I:
 So serve thou Me (only),
 And establish regular prayer
 For celebrating My praise.

15. "Verily the Hour is coming--
 My design is to keep it

Hidden--for every soul
 To receive its reward
 By the measure of
 Its Endeavour.

16. "Therefore let not such as
 Believe not therein
 But follow their own
 Lusts, divert thee therefrom,
 Lest thou perish!"...

17. "And what is that
 In thy right hand,
 O Moses?"

18. He said, "It is
 My rod: on it
 I lean; with it
 I beat down fodder
 For my flocks; and
 In it I find
 Other uses."

19. (God) said, "Throw it,
 O Moses!"

20. He threw it, and behold!
 It was a snake,
 Active in motion.

21. (God) said, "Seize it,
 And fear not: We
 Shall return it at once
 To its former condition"...

22. "Now draw thy hand
 Close to thy side:
 It shall come forth white
 (And shining), without harm
 (Or stain),--as another Sign,--

23. "In order that We
 May show thee
 (Two) of our Greater Signs.

24. "Go thou to Pharaoh,
 For he has indeed
 Transgressed all bounds."

  

SECTION 2.

25. (Moses) said: "O my Lord!
 Expand me my breast;

26. "Ease my task for me;

27. "And remove the impediment
 From my speech,

28. "So they may understand
 What I say:

29. "And give me a Minister
 From my family,

30. "Aaron, my brother;

31. "Add to my strength
 Through him,

32. "And make him share
 My task:

33. "That we may celebrate
 Thy praise without stint,

34. "And remember Thee
 Without stint:

35. "For Thou art He
 That (ever) regardeth us."

36. (God) said: "Granted
 Is thy prayer, O Moses!"

37. "And indeed We conferred
 A favour on thee
 Another time (before).

38. "Behold! We sent
 To thy mother, by inspiration,
 The message:

39. "Throw (the child)
 Into the chest, and throw
 (The chest) into the river:
 The river will cast him
 Up on the bank, and he
 Will be taken up by one
 Who is an enemy to Me
 And an enemy to him
 But I cast (the garment
 Of) love over thee from Me
 And (this) in order that
 Thou mayest be reared
 Under Mine eye.

40. "Behold! thy sister goeth forth
 And saith, "Shall I show you

One who will nurse
 And rear the (child)?
 So We brought thee back
 To thy mother, that her eye
 Might be cooled and she
 Should not grieve.
 Then thou didst slay
 A man, but We saved thee
 From trouble, and We tried
 Thee in various ways.
 Then didst thou tarry
 A number of years
 With the people of Midian.
 Then didst thou come hither
 As ordained, O Moses!

41. "And I have prepared thee
 For Myself (for service)"...

42. "Go, thou and thy brother,
 With My Signs,

And slacken not,
 Either of you, in keeping
 Me in remembrance.

43. "Go, both of you, to Pharaoh,
 For he has indeed
 Transgressed all bounds;

44. "But speak to him mildly;
 Perchance he may take
 Warning or fear (God)."

45. They (Moses and Aaron) said:
 "Our Lord! We fear lest
 He hasten with insolence
 Against us, or lest he
 Transgress all bounds."

46. He said: "Fear not:
 For I am with you:
 I hear and see (everything).

47. "So go ye both to him,
 And say, "Verily we are
 Apostles sent by thy Lord:
 Send forth, therefore, the Children
 Of Israel with us, and
 Afflict them not:
 With a Sign, indeed,
 Have we come from thy Lord!

And Peace to all
 Who follow guidance!

48. "Verily it has been revealed
 To us that the Penalty
 (Awaits) those who reject
 And turn away."

49. (When this message was delivered),
 (Pharaoh) said: "Who, then,
 O Moses, is the Lord
 Of you two?"

50. He said: "Our Lord is
 He Who gave to each
 (Created) thing its form
 And nature, and further,
 Gave (it) guidance."

51. (Pharaoh) said: "What then
 Is the condition
 Of previous generations?"

52. He replied: "The knowledge
 Of that is with my Lord,
 Duly recorded: my Lord
 Never errs, nor forgets,--

53. "He Who has made for you
 The earth like a carpet
 Spread out; has enabled you
 To go about therein by roads
 (And channels); and has sent
 Down water from the sky."
 With it have We produced
 Divers pairs of plants
 Each separate front the others.

54. Eat (for yourselves) and pasture
 Your cattle: verily, in this
 Are Signs for men
 Endued with understanding.

  

SECTION 3.

55. From the (earth) did We
 Create you, and into it
 Shall We return you,
 And from it shall We
 Bring you out once again"

56. And We showed Pharaoh
 All Our Signs, but he
 Did reject and refuse.

57. He said: "Hast thou come
 To drive us out
 Of our land with thy magic,
 O Moses?

58. "But we can surely produce
 Magic to match thine!
 So make a tryst
 Between us and thee,
 Which we shall not fail
 To keep--neither we nor thou--
 In a place where both
 Shall have even chances."

59. Moses said: "Your tryst
 Is the Day of the Festival,
 And let the people be assembled
 When the sun is well up."

60. So Pharaoh withdrew:
 He concerted his plan,
 And then came (back).

61. Moses said to him:
 Woe to you! Forge not
 Ye a lie against God,
 Lest He destroy you (at once)

Utterly by chastisement:
 The forger must suffer
 Frustration!"

62. So they disputed, one with
 Another, over their affair,
 But they kept their talk secret.

63. They said: "These two
 Are certainly (expert) magicians:
 Their object is to drive you
 Out from your land
 With their magic, and
 To do away with your
 Most cherished institutions.

64. "Therefore concert your plan,
 And then assemble
 In (serried) ranks:
 He wins (all along) to-day
 Who gains the upper hand"

65. They said: "O Moses!
 Whether wilt thou
 That thou throw (first)
 Or that we be the first
 To throw?"

66. He said, "Nay, throw ye
 First!" Then behold

Their ropes and their rods--
 So it seemed to him
 On account of their magic--
 Began to be in lively motion!

67. So Moses conceived
 In his mind
 A (sort of) fear.

68. We said: "Fear not!
 For thou hast indeed
 The upper hand:

69. "Throw that which is
 In thy right hand:
 Quickly will it swallow up
 That which they have faked
 What they have faked
 Is but a magician's trick:
 And the magician thrives not,
 (No matter) where he goes."

70. So the magicians were
 Thrown down to prostration:
 They said, "We believe
 In the Lord of Aaron and Moses".

71. (Pharaoh) said: "Believe ye
 In Him before I give
 You permission? Surely
 This must be your leader,
 Who has taught you magic!
 Be sure I will cut off

Your hands and feet
 On opposite sides, and I
 Will have you crucified
 On trunks of palm-trees:
 So shall ye know for certain,
 Which of us can give
 The more severe and the more
 Lasting Punishment!"

72. They said: "Never shall we
 Regard thee as more than
 The Clear Signs that have
 Come to us; or than
 Him Who created us!
 So decree whatever thou
 Desirest to decree: for thou
 Canst only decree (touching)
 The life of this world.

73. "For us, we have believed
 In our Lord: may He
 Forgive us our faults,
 And the magic to which
 Thou didst compel us:
 For God is Best
 And Most Abiding."

74. Verily he who comes
 To his Lord as a sinner
 (At Judgment),--for him
 Is Hell: therein shall he
 Neither die nor live.

75. But such as come
 To Him as Believers
 Who have worked righteous deeds,--
 For them are ranks exalted,--

76. Gardens of Eternity,
 Beneath which flow rivers:
 They will dwell therein
 For aye: such is the reward
 Of those who purify
 Themselves (from evil).

  

SECTION 4.

77. We sent an inspiration
 To Moses: "Travel by night
 With My servants, and strike
 A dry path for them
 Through the sea, without fear
 Of being overtaken (by Pharaoh)
 And without (any other) fear."

78. Then Pharaoh pursued them
 With his forces, but
 The waters completely overwhelmed
 Them and covered them up.

79. Pharaoh led his people astray
 Instead of leading them aright.

80. O ye Children of Israel!
 We delivered you from
 Your enemy, and We
 Made a Covenant with you
 On the right side of
 Mount (Sinai), and We sent
 Down to you Manna
 And quails:

81. (Saying): "Eat of the good
 Things We have provided
 For your sustenance, but
 Commit no excess therein,
 Lest My Wrath should justly
 Descend on you: and those
 On whom descends My Wrath
 Do perish indeed!

82. "But, without doubt, I am
 (Also) He that forgives
 Again and again, to those
 Who repent, believe,
 And do right,--who,
 In fine, are ready to receive
 True guidance."

83. (When Moses was up on the Mount,
 God said:) "What made thee
 Hasten in advance of thy people,
 O Moses?"

84. He replied: "Behold, they are
 Close on my footsteps:

I hastened to Thee.
 O my Lord,
 To please Thee."

85. (God) said: "We have tested
 Thy people in thy absence:
 The Samiri has led them
 Astray."

86. So Moses returned to his people
 In a state of indignation
 And sorrow. He said:
 "O my people! did not
 Your Lord make a handsome
 Promise to you? Did then
 The promise seem to you
 Long (in coming)? Or did ye
 Desire that Wrath should
 Descend from your Lord on you,
 And so ye broke your promise
 To me?"

87. They said: "We broke not
 The promise to thee, as far
 As lay in our power:
 But we were made to carry
 The weight of the ornaments
 Of the (whole) people, and we

Threw them (into the fire),
 And that was what
 The Samiri suggested.

88. "Then he brought out
 (Of the fire) before the (people)
 The image of a calf:
 It seemed to low:
 So they said, "This is
 Your god, and the god
 Of Moses, but (Moses)
 Has forgotten!"

89. Could they not see that
 It could not return them
 A word (for answer), and that
 It had no power either
 To harm them or
 To do them good?

  

SECTION 5.

90. Aaron had already, before this
 Said to them: ."O my people!
 Ye are being tested in this:
 For verily your Lord is (God)
 Most Gracious: so follow me
 And obey my command."

91. They had said: "We will not
 Abandon this cult, but we
 Will devote ourselves to it
 Until Moses returns to us.

92. (Moses) said: "O Aaron!
 What kept thee back, when
 Thou sawest them going wrong,

93. "From following me? Didst thou
 Then disobey my order?"

94. (Aaron) replied: "O son
 Of my mother! Seize (me) not
 By my beard nor by
 (The hair of) my head!
 Truly I feared lest thou
 Shouldst say, "Thou hast caused
 A division among the Children
 Of Israel, and thou didst not
 Respect my word!"

95. (Moses) said: "What then
 Is thy case, O Samari?"

96. He replied: "I saw what
 They saw not: so I took

A handful (of dust) from
 The footprint of the Apostle,
 And threw it (into the calf):
 Thus did my soul suggest
 To me."

97. (Moses) said: "Get thee gone!
 But thy (punishment) in this life
 Will be that thou wilt say,
 'Touch me not'; and moreover
 (For a future penalty) thou hast
 A promise that will not fail:
 Now look at thy god,
 Of whom thou hast become
 A devoted worshipper:
 We will certainly (melt) it
 In a blazing fire and scatter
 It broadcast in the sea!"

98. But the God of you all
 Is the One God: there is
 No god but He: all things
 He comprehends in His knowledge.

99. Thus do We relate to thee
 Some stories of what happened
 Before: for We have sent
 Thee a Message from
 Our own Presence,

100. If any do turn away
 Therefrom, verily they will
 Bear a burden
 On the Day of Judgment;

101. They will abide in this (state):
 And grievous will the burden
 Be to them on that Day,--

102. The Day when the Trumpet
 Will be sounded: that Day,
 We shall gather the sinful,
 Blear-eyed (with terror).

103. In whispers will they consult
 Each other: "Ye tarried not
 Longer than ten (Days);"

104. We know best what they
 Will say, when their leader

Most eminent in Conduct
 Will say: "Ye tarried not
 Longer than a day!"

  

SECTION 6.

105. They ask thee concerning
 The Mountains: say, "My Lord
 Will uproot them and scatter
 Them as dust;

106. "He will leave them as plains
 Smooth and level;

107. "Nothing crooked or curved
 Wilt thou see in their place."

108. On that Day will they follow
 The Caller (straight): no crookedness

(Can they show) him: all sounds
 Shall humble themselves in
 The Presence of (God) Most Gracious:
 Nothing shalt thou hear
 But the tramp of their feet
 (As they march).

109. On that Day shall no
 Intercession avail
 Except for those for whom
 Permission has been granted
 By (God) Most Gracious
 And whose word is
 Acceptable to Him.

110. He knows what (appears
 To His creatures as) before
 Or after or behind them:
 But they shall not compass it
 With their knowledge.

111. (All) faces shall be humbled
 Before (Him)--the Living,
 The Self-Subsisting, Eternal:
 Hopeless indeed will be
 The man that carries
 Iniquity (on his back).

112. But he who works deeds
 Of righteousness, and has faith,
 Will have no fear of harm
 Nor of any curtailment
 (Of what is his due).

113. Thus have We sent this
 Down--an Arabic Qur-an--
 And explained therein in detail
 Some of the warnings,
 In order that they may
 Fear God, or that it may
 Cause their remembrance (of Him).

114. High above all is God,
 The King, the Truth!
 Be not in haste
 With the Qur-an before
 Its revelation to thee
 Is completed, but say,
 "O my Lord! advance me
 In knowledge."

115. We had already, beforehand,
 Taken the covenant of Adam,

But he forgot: and We found
 On his part no firm resolve.

  

SECTION 7.

116. When We said to the angels,
 "Prostrate yourselves to Adam",
 They prostrated themselves, but not
 Iblis: he refused.

117. Then We said: "O Adam!
 Verily, this is an enemy
 To thee and thy wife:
 So let him not get you
 Both out of the Garden,
 So that thou art landed
 In misery.''

118. "There is therein (enough provision)
 For thee not to go hungry
 Nor to go naked,

119. "Nor to suffer from thirst,
 Nor from the sun's heat."

120. But Satan whispered evil
 To him: he said, "O Adam!
 Shall I lead thee to
 The Tree of Eternity
 And to a kingdom
 That never decays?"

121. In the result, they both
 Ate of the tree, and so
 Their nakedness appeared
 To them: they began to sew
 Together, for their covering,
 Leaves from the Garden:
 Thus did Adam disobey
 His Lord, and allow himself
 To be seduced.

122. But his Lord chose him
 (For His Grace): He turned
 To him, and gave him guidance.

123. He said: "Get ye down,
 Both of you,--all together,
 From the Garden, with enmity
 One to another: but if,
 As is sure, there comes to you
 Guidance from Me, whosoever
 Follows My guidance, will not
 Lose his way, nor fall
 Into misery.

124. "But whosoever turns away
 From My Message, verily
 For him is a life narrowed
 Down, and We shall raise

Him up blind on the Day
 Of Judgment."

125. He will say: "O my Lord!
 Why hast thou raised me
 Up blind, while I had
 Sight (before)?"

126. (God) will say: "Thus
 Didst thou, when Our Signs
 Came unto thee, disregard
 Them: so wilt thou,
 This day, be disregarded."

127. And thus do We recompense
 Him who transgresses beyond bounds
 And believes not in the Signs
 Of his Lord: and the Penalty
 Of the Hereafter is far more
 Grievous and more enduring.

128. Is it not a warning to such
 Men (to call to mind)
 How many generations before them
 We destroyed, in whose haunts
 They (now) move? Verily,
 In this are Signs for men
 Endued with understanding.

  

SECTION 8.

129. Had it not been
 For a Word that went forth
 Before from thy Lord,
 (Their punishment) must necessarily
 Have come; but there is
 A term appointed (for respite).

130. Therefore be patient with what
 They say, and celebrate (constantly)
 The praises of thy Lord,
 Before the rising of the sun,
 And before its setting;
 Yea, celebrate them
 For part of the hours
 Of the night, and at the sides
 Of the day: that thou
 Mayest have (spiritual) joy.

131. Nor strain thine eyes in longing
 For the things We have given
 For enjoyment to parties ,
 Of them, the splendour

Of the life of this world,
 Through which We test them:
 But the provision of thy Lord
 Is better and more enduring.

132. Enjoin prayer on thy people,
 And be constant therein.
 We ask thee not to provide
 Sustenance: We provide it
 For thee. But the (fruit of)
 The Hereafter is for Righteousness.

133. ''They say: "Why does he not
 Bring us a Sign from
 His Lord?" Has not
 A Clear Sign come to them
 Of all that was
 In the former Books
 Of revelation?

134. And if We had inflicted
 On them a penalty before this,
 They would have said:
 "Our Lord! If only Thou
 Hadst sent us an apostle,
 We should certainly have followed

Thy Signs before we were
 Humbled and put to shame."

135. Say: "Each one (of us)
 Is waiting: wait ye, therefore,
 And soon shall ye know
 Who it is that is
 On the straight and even
 Way, and who it is
 That has received guidance."



  

Sura XXI.

  

Anbiyaa, or The Prophets



1. Closer and closer to mankind
 Comes their Reckoning: yet they
 Heed not and they turn away.

2. Never comes (aught) to them
 Of a renewed Message
 From their Lord, but they
 Listen to it as in jest,--

3. Their hearts toying as with
 Trifles. The wrong-doers conceal
 Their private counsels, (saying),
 "Is this (one) more than
 A man like yourselves?
 Will ye go to witchcraft
 With your eyes open?"

4. Say: "My Lord
 Knoweth (every) word (spoken)
 In the heavens and on earth:
 He is the One that heareth
 And knoweth (all things)."

5. "Nay," they say, "(these are)
 Medleys of dreams!--Nay,
 He forged it!--Nay,
 He is (but) a poet!
 Let him then bring us
 A Sign like the ones
 That were sent to
 (Prophets) of old!"

6. (As to those) before them,
 Not one of the populations
 Which We destroyed believed:
 Will these believe?

7. Before thee, also, the apostles
 We sent were but men,
 To whom We granted inspiration:
 If ye realise this not, ask
 Of those who possess the Message.

8. Nor did We give them
 Bodies that ate no food,
 Nor were they exempt from death.

9. In the end We fulfilled
 To them Our promise,
 And We saved them
 And those whom We pleased,

But We destroyed those
 Who transgressed beyond bounds.

10. We have revealed for you
 (O men!) a book in which
 Is a Message for you:
 Will ye not then understand?

  

SECTION 2.

11. How many were the populations
 We utterly destroyed because
 Of their iniquities, setting up
 In their places other peoples?

12. Yet, when they felt
 Our Punishment (coming),
 Behold, they (tried to) flee
 From it.

13. Flee not, but return to
 The good things of this life
 Which were given you,
 And to your homes,
 In order that ye may
 Be called to account

14. They said: "Ah! woe to us!
 We were indeed wrong-doers!"

15. And that cry of theirs
 Ceased not, till we made

Them as a field
 That is mown, as ashes
 Silent and quenched.

16. Not for (idle) sport did We
 Create the heavens and the earth
 And all that is between!

17. If it had been Our wish
 To take (just) a pastime,
 We should surely have taken
 It from the things nearest
 To Us, if We would
 Do (such a thing)!

18. Nay, We hurl the Truth
 Against falsehood, and it knocks
 Out its brain, and behold,
 Falsehood doth perish!
 Ah! woe be to you
 For the (false) things
 Ye ascribe (to Us).

19. To Him belong all (creatures)
 In the heavens and on earth:
 Even those who are in His
 (Very) Presence are not 
 Too proud to serve Him,
 Nor are they (ever) weary
 (Of His service):

20. They celebrate His praises
 Night and day, nor do they
 Ever flag or intermit.

21. Or have they taken
 (For worship) gods from the earth
 Who can raise (the dead)?

22. If there were, in the heavens
 And the earth, other gods
 Besides God, there would
 Have been confusion in both!
 But glory to God,
 The Lord of the Throne:
 (High is He) above
 What they attribute to Him!

23. He cannot be questioned
 For His acts, but they
 Will be questioned (for theirs).

24. Or have they taken
 For worship (other) gods
 Besides him? Say, "Bring
 Your convincing proof: this
 Is the Message of those
 With me and the Message
 Of those before me."
 But most of them know not
 The Truth, and so turn away.

25. Not an apostle did We
 Send before thee without
 This inspiration sent by Us
 To him: that there is
 No god but I; therefore
 Worship and serve Me.

26. And they say: "(God)
 Most Gracious has begotten
 Offspring." Glory to Him!
 They are (but) servants raised
 To honour.

27. They speak not before
 He speaks, and they act
 (In all things) by His command.

28. He knows what is before them,
 And what is behind them,
 And they offer no intercession
 Except for those who are
 Acceptable, and they stand
 In awe and reverence
 Of His (glory).

29. If any of them should say,
 "I am a god besides Him",
 Such a one We should
 Reward with Hell: thus
 Do We reward those
 Who do wrong.

  

SECTION 3.

30. Do not the Unbelievers see
 That the heavens and the earth
 Were joined together (as one
 Unit of Creation), before
 We clove them asunder?
 We made from water
 Every living thing. Will they
 Not then believe?

31. And We have set on the earth
 Mountains standing firm,

Lest it should shake with them,
 And We have made therein
 Broad highways
 (between mountains)
 For them to pass through:
 That they may receive guidance.

32. And We have made
 The heavens as a canopy
 Well guarded: yet do they
 Turn away from the Signs
 Which these things (point to)!

33. It is He Who created
 The Night and the Day,
 And the sun and the moon:
 All (the celestial bodies)
 Swim along, each in its
 Rounded course.

34. We granted not to any man
 Before thee permanent life
 (Here): If then thou shouldst die,
 Would they live permanently?

35. Every soul shall have
 A taste of death:
 And We test you
 By evil and by good

By way of trial.
 To Us must ye return.

36. When the Unbelievers see thee,
 They treat thee not except
 With ridicule. "Is this,"
 (They say), "the one who talks
 Of your gods?" And they
 Blaspheme at the mention
 Of (God) Most Gracious!

37. Man is a creature of haste:
 Soon (enough) will I show
 You My Signs; then
 Ye will not ask Me
 To hasten them!

38. They say: "When will this
 Promise come to pass,
 If ye are telling the truth?"

39. If only the Unbelievers
 Knew (the time) when they
 Will not be able
 To ward off the Fire
 From their faces, nor yet
 From their backs, and (when)
 No help can reach them!

40. Nay, it may come to them
 All of a sudden and confound
 Them: no power will they
 Have then to avert it,
 Nor will they (then)
 Get respite.

41. Mocked were (many)
 Apostles before thee;
 But their scoffers
 Were hemmed in
 By the thing that they mocked.

  

SECTION 4.

42. Say, "Who can keep
 You safe by night and by day
 From (the Wrath of) (God)
 Most Gracious?" Yet they
 Turn away from the mention
 Of their Lord.

43. Or have they gods that
 Can guard them from Us?
 They have no power to aid
 Themselves, nor can they
 Be defended from Us.

44. Nay, We gave the good things
 Of this life to these men
 And their fathers until
 The period grew long for them;
 See they not that We
 Gradually reduce the land
 (In their control) from
 Its outlying borders? Is it
 Then they who will win?

45. Say, "I do but warn you
 According to revelation":
 But the deaf will not hear
 The call, (even) when
 They are warned!

46. If but a breath of the Wrath
 Of thy Lord do touch them,
 They will then say, "Woe
 To us! we did wrong indeed!"

47. We shall set up scales
 Of justice for the day
 Of Judgment, so that
 Not a soul will be dealt with
 Unjustly in the least.
 And if there be
 (No more than) the weight
 Of a mustard seed,
 We will bring it (to account):
 And enough are We
 To take account.

48. In the past We granted
 To Moses and Aaron

The Criterion (for judgment),
 And a Light and a Message
 For those who would do right,--

49. Those who fear their Lord
 In their most secret thoughts,
 And who hold the Hour
 (Of Judgment) in awe.

50. And this is a blessed
 Message which We have
 Sent down: will ye then
 Reject it?

51. We bestowed aforetime
 On Abraham his rectitude
 Of conduct, and well were we
 Acquainted with him.

52. Behold! he said
 To his father and his people
 "What are these images,
 To which ye are
 (So assiduously) devoted?"

53. They said, "We found
 Our fathers worshipping them."

54. He said, "Indeed ye
 Have been made in manifest
 Error--ye and your fathers."

55. They said, "Have you
 Brought us the Truth,
 Or are you one
 Of those who jest?"

56. He said, "Nay, your Lord
 Is the Lord of the heavens
 And the earth, He Who
 Created them (from nothing):
 And I am a witness
 To this (truth).

57. "And by god, I have
 A plan for your idols--
 After ye go away
 And turn your backs"...

58. So he broke them to pieces,
 (All) but the biggest of them,
 That they might turn
 (And address themselves) to it.

59. They said, "Who has
 Done this to our gods?
 He must indeed be
 Some man of impiety!"

60. They said, "We heard
 A youth talk of them:
 He is called Abraham."

61. They said, "Then bring him
 Before the eyes of the people,
 That they may bear witness:"

62. They said, "Art thou
 The one that did this
 With our gods, O Abraham?"

63. He said: "Nay, this
 Was done by --
 This is their biggest one!
 Ask them, if they
 Can speak intelligently!"

64. So they turned to themselves
 And said, "Surely ye
 Are the ones in the wrong!

65. Then were they confounded
 With shame: (they said),
 "Thou knowest full well that
 These (idols) do not speak!"

66. (Abraham) said, "Do ye then
 Worship, besides God,
 Things that can neither
 Be of any good to you
 Nor do you harm?

67. "Fie upon you, and upon
 The things that ye worship
 Besides God! Have ye
 No sense?"...

68. They said, "Burn him
 And protect your gods,
 If ye do (anything at all)!"

69. We said, "O Fire!
 Be thou cool,
 And (a means of) safety
 For Abraham!"

70. Then they sought a stratagem
 Against him: but We
 Made them the ones
 That lost most!

71. But We delivered him
 And (his nephew) Lut
 (And directed them) to the land
 Which We have blessed
 For the nations.

72. And We bestowed on him Isaac

And, as an additional gift,
 (A grandson), Jacob, and We
 Made righteous men of every one
 (Of them).

73. And We made them
 Leaders, guiding (men) by
 Our Command, and We
 Sent them inspiration
 To do good deeds,
 To establish regular prayers,
 And to practise regular charity;
 And they constantly served
 Us (and Us only).

74. And to Lut, too,
 We gave Judgment and Knowledge,
 And We saved him
 From the town which practised
 Abominations: truly they were
 A people given to Evil,
 A rebellious people.

75. And We admitted him
 To Our Mercy: for he
 Was one of the Righteous.

  

SECTION 6.

76. (Remember) Noah, when
 He cried (to Us) aforetime:
 We listened to his (prayer)
 And delivered him and his
 Family from great distress.

77. We helped him against
 People who rejected Our Signs:
 Truly they were a people
 Given to Evil: so We
 Drowned them (in the Flood)
 All together.

78. And remember David
 And Solomon, when they
 Gave judgment in the matter
 Of the field into which
 The sheep of certain people
 Had strayed by night:
 We did witness their judgment.

79. To Solomon We inspired
 The (right) understanding
 Of the matter: to each
 (Of them) We gave Judgment
 And Knowledge; it was
 Our power that made
 The hills and the birds
 Celebrate Our praises,
 With David: it was We
 Who did (all these things).

80. It was We Who taught him
 The making of coats of mail

For your benefit, to guard
 You from each other's violence:
 Will ye then be grateful?

81. (It was Our power that
 Made) the violent (unruly)
 Wind flow (tamely) for Solomon,
 To his order, to the land
 Which We had blessed:
 For We do know all things.

82. And of the evil ones,
 Were some who dived
 For him, and did other work
 Besides; and it was We
 Who guarded them.

83. And (remember) Job, when
 He cried to his Lord,
 "Truly distress has seized me,
 But Thou art the Most

Merciful of those that are
 Merciful."

84. So We listened to him:
 We removed the distress
 That was on him,
 And We restored his people
 To him, and doubled
 Their number,--as a Grace
 From Ourselves, and a thing
 For commemoration, for all
 Who serve Us.

85. And (remember) Isma'il,
 Idris, and Zul-kifl, all
 (Men) of constancy and patience;

86. We admitted them to
 Our Mercy: for they
 Were of the Righteous ones.

87. And remember Zun-nun,
 When he departed in wrath:
 He imagined that We
 Had no power over him!
 But he cried through the depths
 Of darkness, "There is
 No god but Thou:
 Glory to Thee: I was
 Indeed wrong!"

88. So We listened to him:
 And delivered him from
 Distress: and thus do We
 Deliver those who have faith.

89. And (remember) Zakariya,
 When he cried to his Lord:
 "O my Lord! leave me not
 Without offspring, though Thou
 Art the best of inheritors."

90. So We listened to him:
 And We granted him

Yabya: We cured his wife's
 (Barrenness) for him. These (three)
 Were ever quick in emulation
 In good works: they used
 To call on Us with love
 And reverence, and humble themselves
 Before Us.

91. And (remember) her who
 Guarded her chastity:
 We breathed into her
 Of Our Spirit, and We
 Made her and her son
 A Sign for all peoples.

92. Verily, this Brotherhood
 Of yours is a single Brotherhood,
 And I am your Lord
 And Cherisher: therefore
 Serve Me (and no other).

93. But (later generations) cut off
 Their affair (of unity),
 One from another: (yet)
 Will they all return to Us.

  

SECTION 7.

94. Whoever works any act
 Of Righteousness and has Faith,--
 His endeavour will not
 Be rejected: We shall
 Record it in his favour.

95. But there is a ban
 On any population which
 We have destroyed: that they
 Shall not return,

96. Until the Gog and Magog (people)
 Are let through (their barrier),
 And they swiftly swarm
 From every hill.

97. Then will the True Promise
 Draw nigh (of fulfilment):
 Then behold! the eyes
 Of the Unbelievers will
 Fixedly stare in horror: "Ah!
 Woe to us! we were indeed
 Heedless of this; nay, we
 Truly did wrong!"

98. Verily ye, (Unbelievers),
 And the (false) gods that
 Ye worship besides God,
 Are (but) fuel for Hell!
 To it will ye (surely) come!

99. If these had been gods,
 They would not have got there!
 But each one will abide
 Therein.

100. There, sobbing will be
 Their lot, nor will they
 There hear (aught else).

101. Whose hose for whom
 The Good (Record) from Us
 Has gone before, will be
 Removed far therefrom.

102. Not the slightest sound
 Will they hear of Hell:
 What their souls desired,
 In that will they dwell.

103. The Great Terror will
 Bring them no grief:
 But the angels will meet them
 (With mutual greetings):
 "This is your Day,--
 (The Day) that ye were promised."

104. The Day that We roll up
 The heavens like a scroll
 Rolled up for books (completed),--
 Even as We produced
 The first Creation, so
 Shall We produce
 A new one: a promise
 We have undertaken:
 Truly shall We fulfil it.

105. Before this We wrote
 In the Psalms, after the Message
 (Given to Moses): "My servants,
 The righteous, shall inherit
 The earth."

106. Verily in this (Qur-an)
 Is a Message for people
 Who would (truly) worship God.

107. We sent thee not, but
 As a Mercy for all creatures.

108. Say: "What has come to me
 By inspiration is that
 Your God is One God:
 Will ye therefore bow
 To His Will (in Islam)?"

109. But if they turn back,
 Say: "I have proclaimed
 The Message to you all alike
 And in truth; but I
 Know not whether that
 Which ye are promised
 Is near or far.

110. "It is He Who knows
 What is open in speech
 And what ye hide
 (In your hearts).

111. "I know not but that
 It may be a trial
 For you, and a grant
 Of (worldly) livelihood
 (To you) for a time."

112. Say: "O my Lord!
 Judge Thou in truth!
 "Our Lord Most Gracious
 Is the One Whose assistance
 Should be sought against
 The blasphemies ye utter!



  

Sura XXII.

  

Hajj, or The Pilgrimage.



1. O mankind! Fear your Lord!
 For the convulsion of the Hour
 (Of Judgment) will be
 A thing terrible!

2. The Day ye shall see it,
 Every mother giving suck
 Shall forget her suckling-babe,
 And every pregnant female
 Shall drop her load (unformed):
 Thou shalt see mankind
 As in a drunken riot,
 Yet not drunk: but dreadful
 Will be the Wrath of God.

3. And yet among men
 There are such as dispute
 About God, without knowledge,
 And follow every evil one
 Obstinate in rebellion!

4. About the (Evil One)
 It is decreed that whoever
 Turns to him for friendship,
 Him will he lead astray,
 And he will guide him
 To the Penalty of the Fire.

5. O mankind! if ye have
 A doubt about the Resurrection,
 (Consider) that We created you
 Out of dust, then out of
 Sperm, then out of a leech-like
 Clot, then out of a morsel
 Of flesh, partly formed
 And partly unformed, in order
 That We may manifest
 (Our power) to you;
 And We cause whom We will
 To rest in the wombs
 For an appointed term,
 Then do We bring you out
 As babes, then (foster you)
 That ye may reach your age
 Of full strength; and some
 Of you are called to die,
 And some are sent back
 To the feeblest old age,
 So that they know nothing
 After having known (much),
 And (further), thou seest
 The earth barren and lifeless,
 But when We pour down
 Rain on it, it is stirred
 (To life), it swells,
 And it puts forth every kind
 Of beautiful growth (in pairs).

6. This is so, because God
 Is the Reality: it is He
 Who gives life to the dead,
 And it is He Who has
 Power over all things.

7. And verily the Hour will come:
 There can be no doubt
 About it, or about (the fact)
 That God will raise up
 All who are in the graves.

8. Yet there is among men
 Such a one as disputes
 About God, without knowledge,
 Without guidance, and without
 A Book of Enlightenment,--

9. (Disdainfully) bending his side,
 In order to lead (men) astray
 From the Path of God:
 For him there is disgrace
 In this life, and on the Day
 Of Judgment We shall
 Make him taste the Penalty
 Of burning (Fire).

10. (It will be said): "This is
 Because of the deeds which
 Thy hands sent forth,
 For verily God is not
 Unjust to His servants."

  

SECTION 2.

11. There are among men
 Some who serve God,
 As it were, on the verge:
 If good befalls them, they are,
 Therewith, well content; but
 If a trial comes to them,
 They turn on their faces:
 They lose both this world
 And the Hereafter: that
 Is loss for all to see!

12. They call on such deities:
 Besides God, as can neither
 Hurt nor profit them:
 That is straying far indeed
 (From the Way)!

13. (Perhaps) they call on one
 Whose hurt is nearer
 Than his profit: evil, indeed,
 Is the patron, and evil
 The companion (for help)!

14. Verily God will admit
 Those who believe and work
 Righteous deeds, to Gardens,
 Beneath which rivers flow:
 For God carries out
 All that He plans,

15. If any think that God
 Will not help him
 (His Apostle) in this world
 And the Hereafter, let him
 Stretch out a rope
 To the ceiling and cut (himself)
 Off: then let him see
 Whether his plan will remove
 That which enrages (him)!

16. Thus have We sent down
 Clear Signs; and verily
 God Both guide whom
 He will!

17. Those who believe (in the Qur-an),
 Those who follow the Jewish (scriptures),
 And the Sabians, Christians,
 Magians, and Polytheists,--
 God will judge between them

On the Day of Judgment:
 For God is witness
 Of all things.

18. Seest thou not that
 To God bow down in worship
 All things that are
 In the heavens and on earth,--
 The sun, the moon, the stars;
 The hills, the trees, the animals;
 And a great number among
 Mankind? But a great number
 Are (also) such as are
 Fit for Punishment: and such
 As God shall disgrace,
 None can raise to honour:
 For God carries out
 All that He wills.

19. These two antagonists dispute
 With each other about their Lord:
 But those who deny (their Lord),--
 For them will be cut out
 A garment of Fire:
 Over their heads will be
 Poured out boiling water.

20. With it will be scalded
 What is within their bodies,
 As well as (their) skins.

21. In addition there will be
 Maces of iron (to punish) them.

22. Every time they wish
 To get away therefrom,
 From anguish, they will be
 Forced back therein, and
 (It will be said), "Taste ye
 The Penalty of Burning!"

  

SECTION 3.

23. God will admit those
 Who believe and work righteous deeds,
 To Gardens beneath which
 Rivers flow: they shall be
 Adorned therein with bracelets
 Of gold and pearls; and
 Their garments there
 Will be of silk.

24. For they have been guided
 (In this life) to the purest
 Of speeches; they have been
 Guided to the Path of Him
 Who is Worthy of (all) Praise.

25. As to those who have rejected
 (God), and would keep back (men)
 From the Way of God, and
 From the Sacred Mosque, which
 We have made (open) to (all) men--
 Equal is the dweller there
 And the visitor from the country
 And any whose purpose therein
 Is profanity or wrong-doing--
 Them will We cause to taste
 Of a most grievous Penalty.

  

SECTION 4.

26. Behold! We gave the site,
 To Abraham, of the (Sacred) House,
 (Saying): "Associate not anything
 (In worship) with Me;
 And sanctify My House
 For those who compass it round,
 Or stand up,
 Or bow, or prostrate themselves
 (Therein in prayer).

27. "And proclaim the Pilgrimage
 Among men: they will come
 To thee on foot and (mounted)
 On every kind of camel,
 Lean on accout of journeys
 Through deep and distant
 Mountain highways;

28. "That they may witness
 The benefits (provided) for them,

And celebrate the name
 Of God, through the Days
 Appointed, over the cattle
 Which He has provided for them
 (For sacrifice): then eat ye
 Thereof and feed the distressed
 Ones in want.

29. "Then let them complete
 The rites prescribed
 For them, perform their vows,
 And (again) circumambulate
 The Ancient House."

30. Such (is the Pilgrimage):
 Whoever honours the sacred
 Rites of God, for him
 It is good in the sight
 Of his Lord. Lawful to you
 (For food in Pilgrimage) are cattle,
 Except those mentioned to you
 (As exceptions): but shun
 The abomination of idols,
 And shun the word
 That is false,--

31. Being true in faith to God,
 And never assigning partners

To Him: if anyone assigns
 Partners to God, he is
 As if he had fallen
 From heaven and been snatched up
 By birds, or the wind
 Had swooped (like a bird
 On its prey) and thrown him
 Into a far-distant place.

32. Such (is his state): and
 Whoever holds in honour
 The Symbols of God,
 (In the sacrifice of animals),
 Such (honour) should come truly
 From piety of heart.

33. In them ye have benefits
 For a term appointed:
 In the end their place
 Of sacrifice is near
 The Ancient House.

  

SECTION 5.

34. To every people did We
 Appoint rites (of sacrifice),
 That they might celebrate
 The name of God over

The sustenance He gave them
 From animals (fit for food).
 But your god is One God:
 Submit then your wills to him
 (In Islam): and give thou
 The good news to those
 Who humble themselves,--

35. To those whose hearts,
 When God is mentioned,
 Are filled with fear,
 Who show patient perseverance
 Over their afflictions, keep up
 Regular prayer, and spend
 (In charity) out of what
 We have bestowed upon them.

36. The sacrificial camels
 We have made for you
 As among the symbols from
 God: in them is (much)
 Good for you: then pronounce
 The name of God over them
 As they line up (for sacrifice):
 When they are down
 On their sides (after slaughter),
 Eat ye thereof, and feed
 Such as (beg not but)
 Live in contentment,
 And such as beg
 With due humility: thus have

We made animals subject
 To you, that ye
 May be grateful.

37. It is not their meat
 Nor their blood, that reaches
 God: it is your piety
 That reaches Him: He
 Has thus made them subject
 To you, that ye may glorify
 God for his guidance to you:
 And proclaim the Good News
 To all who do right.

38. Verily God will defend
 (From ill) those who believe:
 Verily, God loveth not
 Any that is a traitor
 To faith, or shows ingratitude.

  

SECTION 6.

39. To those against whom
 War is made, permission
 Is given (to fight), because
 They are wronged;--and verily,
 God is most Powerful
 For their aid;--

40. (They are) those who have
 Been expelled from their homes

In defiance of right,
 (For no cause) except
 That they say," Lord
 Is God". Did not God
 Check one set of people
 By means of another,
 There would surely have been
 Pulled down monasteries, churches,
 Synagogues, and mosques, in which
 The name of God is commemorated
 In abundant measure. God will
 Certainly aid those who
 Aid His (cause);--for verily
 God is Full of Strength,
 Exalted in Might,
 (Able to enforce His Will).

41. (They are) those who,
 If We establish them
 In the land, establish
 Regular prayer and give
 Regular charity, enjoin
 The right and forbid wrong:
 With God rests the end
 (And decision) of (all) affairs.

42. If they treat thy (mission)
 As false, so did the Peoples

Before them (with their Prophets),--
 The People of Noah,
 And 'Ad and Thamud;

43. Those of Abraham and Lut;

44. And the Companions
 Of the Madyan people;
 And Moses was rejected
 (In the same way). But I
 Granted respite to the Unbelievers,
 And (only) after that
 Did I punish them:
 But how (terrible) was
 My rejection (of them)!

45. How many populations have We
 Destroyed, which were given
 To wrong-doing? They tumbled down
 On their roofs. And how many
 Wells are lying idle and neglected,
 And castles lofty and well-built?

46. Do they not travel
 Through the land, so that
 Their hearts (and minds)
 May thus learn wisdom

And their ears may
 Thus learn to hear?
 Truly it is not their eyes
 That are blind, but their
 Hearts which are
 In their breasts.

47. Yet they ask thee
 To hasten on the Punishment!
 But God will not fail
 In His promise. Verily
 A Day in the sight of thy Lord
 Is like a thousand years
 Of your reckoning.

48. And to how many populations
 Did I give respite, which
 Were given to wrong-doing?
 In the end I punished them.
 To Me is the destination (of all).

  

SECTION 7.

49. Say: "O men! I am
 (Sent) to you only to give

A clear warning:

50. "Those who believe and work
 Righteousness, for them
 Is forgiveness and a sustenance
 Most generous.

51. "But those who strive
 Against Our Signs, to frustrate
 Them,--they will be
 Companions of the Fire."

52. Never did We send
 An apostle or a prophet
 Before thee, but, when he
 Framed a desire, Satan
 Threw some (vanity)
 Into his desire: but God
 Will cancel anything (vain)
 That Satan throws in,
 And God will confirm
 (And establish) His Signs:
 For God is full of knowledge
 And wisdom:

53. That He may make
 The suggestions thrown in
 By Satan, but a trial
 For those in whose hearts

 a disease and who are
 Hardened of heart: verily
 The wrong-doers are in a schism
 Far (from the Truth):

54. And that those on whom
 Knowledge has been bestowed may learn
 That the (Qur-an) is the Truth
 From thy Lord, and that they
 May believe therein, and their hearts
 May be made humbly (open)
 To it: for verily God is
 The Guide of those who believe,
 To the Straight Way.

55. Those who reject Faith
 Will not cease to be
 In doubt concerning (Revelation)
 Until the Hour (of Judgment)
 Comes suddenly upon them,
 Or there comes to them
 The Penalty of a Day of Disaster.

56. On that Day the Dominion
 Will be that of God:
 He will judge between them:
 So those who believe
 And work righteous deeds will be
 In Gardens of Delight.

57. And for those who reject Faith
 And deny Our Signs,
 There will be a humiliating
 Punishment.

  

SECTION 8.

58. Those who leave their homes
 In the cause of God,
 And are then slain or die,
 On them will God bestow verily
 A goodly Provision:
 Truly God is He Who
 Bestows the best Provision.

59. Verily He will admit then
 To a place with which
 They shall be well pleased:
 For God is All-Knowing,
 Most Forbearing.

60. That (is so). And if one
 Has retaliated to no greater
 Extent than the injury he received,
 And is again set upon
 Inordinately, God will help
 Him: for God is One
 That blots out (sins)
 And forgives (again and again).

61. What is because God merges
 Night into Day, and He
 Merges Day into Night, and
 Verily it is God Who hears

And sees (all things).

62. That is because God--He
 Is the Reality; and those
 Besides Him whom they invoke,--
 They are but vain Falsehood:
 Verily God is He, Most High,
 Most Great.

63. Seest thou not that God
 Sends down rain from the sky,
 And forthwith the earth
 Becomes clothed with green?
 For God is He Who understands
 The finest mysteries, and
 Is well-acquainted (with them).

64. To Him belongs all that is
 In the heavens and on earth:
 For verily God,--He is
 Free of all wants,
 Worthy of all praise.

  

SECTION 9.

65. Seest thou not that God
 Has made subject to you (men)
 All that is on the earth,
 And the ships that sail
 Through the sea by His command?
 He withholds the sky (rain)
 From falling on the earth
 Except by His leave:
 For God is Most Kind
 And Most Merciful to man.

66. It is He Who gave you life,
 Will cause you to die,
 And will again give you
 Life: truly man is
 A most ungrateful creature!

67. To every People have We
 Appointed rites and ceremonies
 Which they must follow:
 Let them not then dispute
 With thee on the matter,
 But do thou invite (them)
 To thy Lord: for thou art
 Assuredly on the Right Way.

68. If they do wrangle with thee,
 Say, "God knows best
 What it is ye are doing."

69. "God will judge between you
 On the Day of Judgment
 Concerning the matters in which
 Ye differ."

70. Knowest thou not that
 God knows all that is
 In heaven and on earth?
 Indeed it is all
 In a record, and that
 Is easy for God.

71. Yet they worship, besides God,
 Things for which no authority
 Has been sent down to them,
 And of which they have
 (Really) no knowledge:
 For those that do wrong
 There is no helper.

72. When Our Clear Signs
 Are rehearsed to them,
 Thou wilt notice a denial
 On the faces of the Unbelievers!
 They nearly attack with violence
 Those who rehearse Our Signs
 To them. Say, "Shall I
 Tell you of something
 (Far) worse than these Signs?
 It is the Fire (of Hell)!

God has promised it
 To the Unbelievers!
 And evil is that destination!"

  

SECTION 10.

73. O men! Here is
 A parable set forth!
 Listen to it! Those
 On whom, besides God,
 Ye call, cannot create
 (Even) a fly, if they all
 Met together for the purpose!
 And if the fly should snatch
 Away anything from them,
 They would have no power
 To release it from the fly.
 Feeble are those who petition
 And those whom they petition!

74. No just estimate have they
 Made of God: for God
 Is He Who is strong
 And able to carry out
 His Will.

75. God chooses Messengers
 From angels and from men
 For God is He Who hears
 And sees (all things).

76. He knows what is before them
 And what is behind them:

And to God go back
 All questions (for decision).

77. O ye who believe!
 Bow down, prostrate yourselves,
 And adore your Lord;
 And do good;
 That ye may prosper.

78. And strive in His cause
 As ye ought to strive,
 (With sincerity and under discipline).
 He has chosen you, and has
 Imposed no difficulties on you
 In religion; it is the cult
 Of your father Abraham.
 It is He Who has named
 You Muslims, both before
 And in this (Revelation);
 That the Apostle may be
 A witness for you, and ye
 Be witnesses for mankind!
 So establish regular Prayer,
 Give regular Charity,
 And hold fast to God!
 He is your Protector--
 The best to protect
 And the Best to help!



  

Sura XXIII.

  

Mu-minun, or The Believers.



1. The Believers must
 (Eventually) win through,--

2. Those who humble themselves
 In their prayers;

3. Who avoid vain talk;

4. Who are active in deeds
 Of charity;

5. Who abstain from sex,

6. Except with those joined
 To them in the marriage bond,
 Or (the captives) whom
 Their right hands possess,--
 For (in their case) they are
 Free from blame,

7. But those whose desires exceed
 Those limits are transgressors;--

8. Those who faithfully observe
 Their trusts and their covenants;

9. And who (strictly) guard
 Their prayers;--

10. These will be the heirs,

11. Who will inherit Paradise:
 They will dwell therein
 (For ever).

12. Man We did create
 From a quintessence (of clay);

13. Then We placed him
 As (a drop of) sperm

In a place of rest,
 Firmly fixed;

14. Then We made the sperm
 Into a clot of congealed blood;
 Then of that clot We made
 A (foetus) lump; then We
 Made out of that lump
 Bones and clothed the bones
 With flesh; then We developed
 Out of it another creature.
 So blessed be God,
 The Best to create!

15. After that, at length
 Ye will die.

16. Again, on the Day
 Of Judgment, will ye be
 Raised up.

17. And We have made, above you,
 Seven tracts; and We
 Are never unmindful
 Of (Our) Creation,

18. And We send down water
 From the sky according to
 (Due) measure, and We cause it
 To soak in the soil;
 And We certainly are able
 To drain it off (with ease).

19. With it We grow for you
 Gardens of date-palms
 And vines: in them have ye
 Abundant fruits: and of them
 Ye eat (and have enjoyment),--

20. Also a tree springing
 Out of Mount Sinai,
 Which produces oil,
 And relish for those
 Who use it for food.

21. And in cattle (too) ye
 Have an instructive example:
 From within their bodies
 We produce (milk) for you

To drink; there art, in them,
 (Besides), numerous (other)
 Benefits for you;
 And of their (meat) ye eat;

22. And on them, as well as
 In ships, ye ride.

  

SECTION 2.

23. (Further, We sent a long line
 Of prophets for your instruction).
 We sent Noah to his people:
 He said, "O my people!
 Worship God! Ye have
 No other god but Him.
 Will ye not fear (Him)?"

24. The chiefs of the Unbelievers
 Among his people said:
 "He is no more than a man
 Like yourselves: his wish is
 To assert his superiority
 Over you: if God had wished
 (To send messengers),
 He could have sent down
 Angels: never did we hear
 Such a thing (as he says),
 Among our ancestors of old."

25. (And some said): "He is
 Only a man possessed:
 Wait (and have patience)
 With him for a time."

26. (Noah) said: "O my Lord!
 Help me: for that they
 Accuse me of falsehood!"

27. So We inspired him
 (With this message): "Construct
 The Ark within Our sight
 And under Our guidance: then
 When comes Our command,
 And the fountains of the earth
 Gush forth, take thou on board
 Pairs of every species, male
 And female, and thy family--
 Except those of them
 Against whom the Word
 Has already gone forth:
 And address Me not
 In favour of the wrong-doers;
 For they shall be drowned
 (In the Flood).

28. And when thou hast embarked
 On the Ark--thou and those
 With thee,--say: "Praise be
 To God, Who has saved us
 From the people who do wrong."

29. And say: "O my Lord!
 Enable me to disembark
 With Thy blessing: for Thou
 Art the Best to enable (us)
 To disembark."

30. Verily in this there are
 Signs (for men to understand);
 (Thus) do We try (men)."

31. Then We raised after them
 Another generation.

32. And We sent to them
 An apostle from among themselves,
 (Saying), "Worship God!
 Ye have no other god
 But Him. Will ye not
 Fear (Him)?"

  

SECTION 3.

33. And the chiefs
 Of his people, who disbelieved
 And denied the Meeting
 In the Hereafter, and on whom
 We had bestowed the good things
 Of this life, said: "He is
 No more than a man
 Like yourselves: he eats
 Of that of which ye eat,
 And drinks of what ye drink.

34. "If ye obey a man
 Like yourselves, behold,
 It is certain ye will be lost.

35. "Does he promise that
 When ye die and become dust
 And bones, ye shall be
 Brought forth (again)?

36. "Far, very far is that
 Which ye are promised!

37. "There is nothing but
 Our life in this world!
 We shall die and we live!
 But we shall never
 Be raised up again!

38. "He is only a man
 Who invents a lie
 Against God, but we
 Are not the ones
 To believe in him!"

39. (The prophet) said:
 "O my Lord! help me:
 For that they accuse me
 Of falsehood."

40. (God) said: "In but
 A little while, they
 Are sure to be sorry!"

41. Then the Blast overtook them
 With justice, and We made them
 As rubbish of dead leaves
 (Floating on the stream of Time)!
 So away with the people
 Who do wrong!

42. Then We raised after them
 Other generations.

43. No people can hasten
 Their term, nor can they
 Delay (it).

44. Then sent We Our apostles
 In succession: every time
 There came to a people
 Their apostle, they accused him
 Of falsehood: so We made
 Them follow each other
 (In punishment): We made them
 As a tale (that is told):
 So away with a people
 That will not believe!

45. When We sent Moses
 And his brother Aaron,
 With Our Signs and
 Authority manifest,

46. To Pharaoh and his Chiefs:
 But these behaved insolently:
 They were an arrogant people.

47. They said: "Shall we believe
 In two men like ourselves?
 And their people are subject
 To us!"

48. So they accused them
 Of falsehood, and they became
 Of those who were destroyed.

49. And We gave Moses
 The Book, in order that
 They might receive guidance.

50. And We made
 The son of Mary
 And his mother
 As a Sign:
 We gave them both
 Shelter on high ground,
 Affording rest and security
 And furnished with springs.

  

SECTION 4.

51. O ye apostles! enjoy
 (All) things good and pure,
 And work righteousness:
 For I am well-acquainted
 With (all) that ye do.

52. And verily this Brotherhood
 Of yours is a single Brotherhood,
 And I am your Lord
 And Cherisher: therefore
 Fear Me (and no other).

53. But people have cut off
 Their affair (of unity),
 Between them, into sects:
 Each party rejoices in that
 Which is with itself.

54. But leave them
 In their confused ignorance
 For a time.

55. Do they think that because
 We have granted them abundance
 Of wealth and sons,

56. We would hasten them
 On in every good? Nay,
 They do not understand.

57. Verily those who live
 In awe for fear of their Lord;

58. Those who believe
 In the Signs of their Lord;

59. Those who join not (in worship)
 Partners with their Lord;

60. And those who dispense
 Their charity with their hearts
 Full of fear, because
 They will return to their Lord;--

61. It is these who hasten
 In every good work,
 And these who are
 Foremost in them.

62. On no soul do We
 Place a burden greater
 Than it can bear:
 Before Us is a record
 Which clearly shows the truth:
 They will never be wronged.

63. But their hearts are
 In confused ignorance
 Of this; and there are,
 Besides that, deeds of theirs,
 Which they will (continue)
 To do,--

64. Until, when We seize
 In Punishment those of them
 Who received the good things
 Of this world, behold,
 They will groan in supplication!

65. (It will be said):
 "Groan not in supplication
 This day; for ye shall
 Certainly not be helped by Us.

66. "My Signs used to be
 Rehearsed to you, but ye
 Used to turn back
 On your heels--

67. "In arrogance: talking nonsense
 About the (Qur-an), like one
 Telling fables by night."

68. Do they not ponder over
 The Word (of God), or
 Has anything (new) come
 To them that did not
 Come to their fathers of old?

69. Or do they not recognise
 Their Apostle, that they
 Deny him?

70. Or do they say, "he is
 Possessed"? Nay, he has
 Brought them the Truth,
 But most of them
 Hate the Truth.

71. If the Truth had been
 In accord with their desires,
 Truly the heavens and the earth,
 And all beings therein
 Would have been in confusion
 And corruption! Nay, We
 Have sent them their admonition,
 But they turn away
 From their admonition.

72. Or is it that thou
 Askest them for some
 Recompense? But the recompense
 Of thy Lord is best:
 He is the Best of those
 Who give sustenance.

73. But verily thou callest them
 To the Straight Way;

74. And verily those who
 Believe not in the Hereafter
 Are deviating from that Way.

75. If We had mercy on them
 And removed the distress
 Which is on them, they
 Would obstinately persist
 In their transgression,
 Wandering in distraction
 To and fro.

76. We inflicted Punishment
 On them, but they
 Humbled not themselves
 To their Lord, nor do they
 Submissively entreat (Him)!--

77. Until We open on them
 A gate leading to
 A severe Punishment: then
 Lo! they will be plunged
 In despair therein!

  

SECTION 5.

78. It is He Who has created
 For you (the faculties of)
 Hearing, sight, feeling
 And understanding: little thanks
 It is ye give!

79. And He Has multiplied you
 Through the earth, and to Him
 Shall ye be gathered back.

80. It is He Who gives
 Life and death, and to Him
 (Is due) the alternation
 Of Night and Day:
 Will ye not then understand?

81. On the contrary they say
 Things similar to what
 The ancients said.

82. They say: "What! When we
 Die and become dust and bones,
 Could we really be
 Raised up again?

83. "Such things have been promised
 To us and to our fathers
 Before! They are nothing
 But tales of the ancients!"

84. Say: "To whom belong
 The earth and all beings therein?
 (Say) if ye know!"

85. They will say, "To God!"
 Say: "Yet will ye not
 Receive admonition?"

86. Say: "Who is the Lord
 Of the seven heavens,
 And the Lord of the Throne
 (Of Glory) Supreme?"

87. They will say, "(They belong)
 To God." Say: "Will ye not
 Then be filled with awe?"

88. Say: "Who is it in whose
 Hands is the governance
 Of all things,--who protects
 (All), but is not protected
 (Of any)? (Say) if ye know."

89. They will say, "(It belongs)
 To God." Say: "Then how
 Are ye deluded?"

90. We have sent them the Truth:
 But they indeed practise Falsehood!

91. No son did God beget,
 Nor is there any god
 Along with Him: (if there were
 Many gods), behold, each god
 Would have taken away
 What he had created,
 And some would have
 Lorded it over others!
 Glory to God! (He is free)
 From the (sort of) things
 They attribute to Him!

92. He knows what is hidden
 And what is open: too high
 Is He for the partners
 They attribute to Him!

  

SECTION 6.

93. Say: "O my Lord!
 If Thou wilt show me
 (In my lifetime) that which
 They are warned against,--

94. "Then, O my Lord! put me not
 Amongst the people
 Who do wrong!"

95. And We are certainly able
 To show thee (in fulfilment)
 That against which they are warned.

96. Repel evil with that'
 Which is best: We are
 Well acquainted with
 The things they say.

97. And say "O my Lord!
 I seek refuge with Thee

From the suggestions
 Of the Evil Ones.

98. "And I seek refuge with Thee
 O my Lord! lest they
 Should come near me."

99. (In Falsehood will they be)
 Until, when death comes
 To one of them, he says:
 "O my Lord! send me back
 (To life),--

100. "In order that I may
 Work righteousness in the things
 I neglected."--"By no means!
 It is but a word he says."--
 Before them is a Partition
 Till the Day they are
 Raised up.

101. When the Trumpet
 Is blown, there will be
 No more relationships
 Between them that day,
 Nor will one ask after another!

102. Then those whose balance
 (Of good deeds) is heavy,--
 They will attain salvation:

103. But those whose balance
 Is light, will be those
 Who have lost their souls;
 In Hell will they abide.

104. The Fire will burn their faces,
 And they will therein
 Grin, with their lips displaced.

105. "Were not My Signs rehearsed
 To you, and ye did but
 Treat them as falsehoods?"

106. They will say: "Our Lord!
 Our misfortune overwhelmed us,
 And we became a people
 Astray!

107. "Our Lord! Bring us out
 Of this: if ever we return
 (To evil), then shall we be
 Wrong-doers indeed!"

108. He will say: "Be ye
 Driven into it (with ignominy)!
 And speak ye not to Me!

109. "A part of My servants
 There was, who used to pray,

'Our Lord! we believe;
 Then do Thou forgive us,
 And have mercy upon us:
 For Thou art the Best
 Of those who show mercy!'

110. "But ye treated them
 With ridicule, so much so
 That (ridicule of) them made you
 Forget My Message while
 Ye were laughing at them!

111. "I have rewarded them
 This day for their patience
 And constancy: they are indeed
 The ones that have achieved Bliss:.."

112. He will say: "What number
 Of years did ye stay
 On earth?"

113. They will say: "We stayed
 A day or part of a day:
 But ask those who
 Keep account."

114. He will say: "Ye stayed
 Not but a little,--
 If ye had only known!

115. "Did ye then think
 That We had created you

In jest, and that ye
 Would not be brought back
 To Us (for account)?"

116. Therefore exalted be God,
 The King, the Reality:
 There is no god but He,
 The Lord of the Throne
 Of Honour!

117. If anyone invokes, besides God,
 Any other god, he has
 No authority therefor;
 And his reckoning will be
 Only with his Lord!
 And verily the Unbelievers
 Will fail to win through

118. So say: "O my Lord!
 Grant Thou forgiveness and mercy!
 For Thou art the Best
 Of those who show mercy!"



  

Sura XXIV.

  

Nur, or Light.



1. A Sura which We
 Have sent down and
 Which We have ordained:
 In it have We sent down
 Clear Signs, in order that
 Ye may receive admonition.

2. The woman and the man
 Guilty of adultery or fornication,--
 Flog each of them
 With a hundred stripes:
 Let not compassion move you
 In their case, in a matter
 Prescribed by God, if ye believe
 In God and the Last Day:
 And let a party
 Of the Believers
 Witness their punishment.

3. Let no man guilty of
 Adultery or fornication marry
 Any but a woman
 Similarly guilty, or an Unbeliever:
 Nor let any but such a man
 Or an Unbeliever
 Marry such a woman:
 To the Believers such a thing
 Is forbidden.

4. And those who launch
 A charge against chaste women,
 And produce not four witnesses
 (To support their allegations),--
 Flog them with eighty stripes;
 And reject their evidence
 Ever after: for such men
 Are wicked transgressors;--

5. Unless they repent thereafter
 And mend (their conduct);
 For God is Oft-Forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

6. And for those who launch
 A charge against their spouses,
 And have (in support)
 No evidence but their own,--

Their solitary evidence
 (Can be received) if they
 Bear witness four times
 (With an oath) by God
 That they are solemnly
 Telling the truth;

7. And the fifth (oath)
 (Should be) that they solemnly
 Invoke the curse of God
 On themselves if they
 Tell a lie.

8. But it would avert
 The punishment from the wife,
 If she bears witness
 Four times (with an oath)
 By God, that (her husband)
 Is telling a lie;

9. And the fifth (oath)
 Should be that she solemnly
 Invokes the wrath of God
 On herself if (her accuser)
 Is telling the truth.

10. If it were not
 For God's grace and mercy
 On you, and that God
 Is Oft-Returning,
 Full of wisdom,
 (Ye would be ruined indeed).

  

SECTION 2.

11. Those who brought forward
 The lie are a body

Among yourselves: think it not
 To be an evil to you;
 On the contrary it is good
 For you: to every man
 Among them (will come
 The punishment) of the sin
 That he earned, and to him
 Who took on himself the lead
 Among them, will be
 A Penalty grievous.

12. Why did not the Believers
 Men and women--when ye
 Heard of the affair,--put
 The best construction on it
 In their own minds
 And say, "This (charge)
 Is an obvious lie"?

13. Why did they not bring
 Four witnesses to prove it?
 When they have not brought
 The witnesses, such men,
 In the sight of God,
 (Stand forth) themselves as liars!

14. Were it not for the grace
 And mercy of God on you,
 In this world and the Hereafter,
 A grievous penalty would have
 Seized you in that ye rushed
 Glibly into this affair.

15. Behold, ye received it
 On your tongues,

And said out of your mouths
 Things of which ye had
 No knowledge; and ye thought
 It to be a light matter,
 While it was most serious
 In the sight of God.

16. And why did ye not,
 When ye heard it, say?--
 "It is not right of us
 To speak of this:
 Glory to God! this is
 A most serious slander!"

17. God doth admonish you,
 That ye may never repeat
 Such (conduct), if ye
 Are (true) Believers.

18. And God makes the Signs
 Plain to you: for God
 Is full of knowledge and wisdom.

19. Those who love (to see)
 Scandal published broadcast
 Among the Believers, will have
 A grievous Penalty in this life
 And in the Hereafter: God
 Knows, and ye know not.

20. Were it not for the grace
 And mercy of God on you,

And that God is
 Full of kindness and mercy,
 (Ye would be ruined indeed).

  

SECTION 3.

21. O ye who believe!
 Follow not Satan's footsteps:
 If any will follow the footsteps
 Of Satan, he will (but) command
 What is shameful and wrong:
 And were it not for the grace
 And mercy of God on you.
 Not one of you would ever
 Have been pure: but God
 Doth purify whom He pleases:
 And God is One Who
 Hears and knows (all things).

22. Let not those among you
 Who are endued with grace
 And amplitude of means
 Resolve by oath against helping
 Their kinsmen, those in want,
 And those who have left

Their homes in God's cause:
 Let them forgive and overlook,
 Do you not wish
 That God should forgive you?
 For God is Oft-Forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

23. Those who slander chaste women,
 Indiscreet but believing,
 Are cursed in this life
 And in the Hereafter:
 For them is a grievous Penalty,--

24. On the Day when their tongues,
 Their hands, and their feet
 Will bear witness against them
 As to their actions.

25. On that Day God
 Will pay them back
 (All) their just dues,
 And they will realise
 That God is
 The (very) Truth,
 That makes all things manifest.

26. Women impure are for men impure
 And men impure for women impure
 And women of purity
 Are for men of purity,
 And men of purity
 Are for women of purity:
 These are not affected

By what people say:
 For them there is forgiveness,
 And a provision honourable.

  

SECTION 4.

27. O ye who believe!
 Enter not houses other than
 Your own, until ye have
 Asked permission and saluted
 Those in them: that is
 Best for you, in order that
 Ye may heed (what is seemly).

28. If ye find no one
 In the house, enter not
 Until permission is given
 To you: if ye are asked
 To go back, go back:
 That makes for greater purity

For yourselves: and God
 Knows well all that ye do.

29. It is no fault on your part
 To enter houses not used
 For living in, which serve
 Some (other) use for you:
 And God has knowledge
 Of what ye reveal
 And what ye conceal.

30. Say to the believing men
 That they should lower
 Their gaze and guard
 Their modesty: that will make
 For greater purity for them:
 And God is well acquainted
 With all that they do.

31. And say to the believing women
 That they should lower
 Their gaze and guard
 Their modesty; that they
 Should not display their
 Beauty and ornaments except
 What (must ordinarily) appear
 Thereof; that they should

Draw their veils over
 Their bosoms and not display
 Their beauty except
 To their husbands, their fathers,
 Their husbands' fathers, their sons,
 Their husbands' sons,
 Their brothers or their brothers' sons,
 Or their sisters' sons,
 Or their women, or the slaves
 Whom their right hands
 Possess, or male servants
 Free of physical needs,
 Or small children who
 Have no sense of the shame
 Of sex; and that they
 Should not strike their feet
 In order to draw attention
 To their hidden ornaments.
 And O ye Believers!
 Turn ye all together
 Towards God, that ye
 May attain Bliss.

32. Marry those among you
 Who are single, or
 The virtuous ones among
 Your slaves, male or female:
 If they are in poverty,
 God will give them
 Means out of His grace:
 For God encompasseth all,
 And He knoweth all things.

33. Let those who find not
 The wherewithal for marriage
 Keep themselves chaste, until
 God gives them means
 Out of His grace.
 And if any of your slaves
 Ask for a deed in writing
 (To enable them to earn
 Their freedom for a certain sum),
 Give them such a deed
 If ye know any good
 In them; yea, give them
 Something yourselves
 Out of the means which
 God has given to you.
 But force not your maids
 To prostitution when they desire
 Chastity, in order that ye
 May make a gain
 In the goods of this life.
 But if anyone compels them,
 Yet, after such compulsion,
 Is God Oft-Forgiving,
 Most Merciful (to them).

34. We have already sent down
 To you verses making things
 Clear, an illustration from (the story
 Of) people who passed away
 Before you, and an admonition
 For those who fear (God).

  

SECTION 5.

35. God is the Light
 Of the heavens and the earth.
 The parable of His Light
 Is as if there were a Niche
 And within it a Lamp:
 The Lamp enclosed in Glass:

The glass as it were
 A brilliant star:
 Lit from a blessed Tree,
 An Olive, neither of the East
 Nor of the West,
 Whose Oil is well-nigh
 Luminous,
 Though fire scarce touched it
 Light upon Light!
 God doth guide
 Whom He will
 To His Light:
 God doth set forth Parables
 For men: and God
 Doth know all things.

36. (Lit is such a Light)
 In houses, which God
 Hath permitted to be raised
 To honour; for the celebration,

In them, of His name:
 In them is He glorified
 In the mornings and
 In the evenings, (again and again),

37. By men whom neither
 Traffic nor merchandise
 Can divert from the Remembrance
 Of God, nor from regular Prayer,
 Nor from the practice
 Of regular Charity:
 Their (only) fear is
 For the Day when
 Hearts and eyes
 Will be transformed
 (In a world wholly new),--

38. That God may reward them
 According to the best
 Of their deeds, and add
 Even more for them
 Out of His Grace:
 For God doth provide
 For those whom He will,
 Without measure.

39. but the Unbelievers,--
 Their deeds are like a mirage

In sandy deserts, which
 The man parched with thirst
 Mistakes for water; until
 When he comes up to it,
 He finds it to be nothing:
 But he finds God
 (Ever) with him, and God
 Will pay him his account:
 And God is swift
 In taking account.

40. Or (the Unbelievers' state)
 Is like the depths of darkness
 In a vast deep ocean,
 Overwhelmed with billow
 Topped by billow,
 Topped by (dark) clouds:
 Depths of darkness, one
 Above another: if a man
 Stretches out his hand,
 He can hardly see it!
 For any to whom God
 Giveth not light,
 There is no light!

  

SECTION 6.

41. Seest thou not that it is
 God Whose praises all beings
 In the heavens and on earth
 Do celebrate, and the birds

(Of the air) with wings
 Outspread? Each one knows
 Its own (mode of) prayer
 And praise. And God
 Knows well all that they do.

42. Yea, to God belongs
 The dominion of the heavens
 And the earth; and to God
 Is the final goal (of all).

43. Seest thou not that God
 Makes the clouds move
 Gently, then joins them
 Together, then makes them
 Into a heap?--then wilt thou
 See rain issue forth
 From their midst. And He
 Sends down from the sky
 Mountain masses (of clouds)
 Wherein is hail: He strikes
 Therewith whom He pleases
 And He turns it away
 From whom He pleases.
 The vivid flash of His lightning
 Well-nigh blinds the sight.

44. It is God Who alternates
 The Night and the Day:

Verily in these things
 Is an instructive example
 For those who have vision!

45. And God has created
 Every animal from water: sort
 Of them there are some
 That creep on their bellies;
 Some that walk on two legs;
 And some that walk on four.
 God creates what He wills;
 For verily God has power
 Over all things.

46. We have indeed sent down
 Signs that make things manifest:
 And God guides whom He wills
 To a Way that is straight.

47. They say, "We believe
 In God and in the Apostle,
 And we obey": but
 Even after that, some of them
 Turn away: they are not
 (Really) Believers.

48. When they are summoned
 To God and His Apostle,
 In order that he may judge
 Between them, behold, some
 Of them decline (to come).

49. But if the right is
 On their side, they come
 To him with all submission

50. Is it that there is
 A disease in their hearts
 Or do they doubt,
 Or are they in fear,
 That God and His Apostle
 Will deal unjustly with them?
 Nay, it is they themselves
 Who do wrong.

  

SECTION 7.

51. The answer of the Believers,
 When summoned to God
 And His Apostle, in order
 That he may judge between them,
 Is no other than this:
 They say, "We hear and we obey":
 It is such as these
 That will attain felicity.

52. It is such as obey
 God and His Apostle,
 And fear God and do
 Right, that will win
 (In the end).

53. They swear their strongest oaths
 By God that, if only thou

Wouldst command them, they
 Would leave (their homes).
 Say: "Swear ye not;
 Obedience is (more) reasonable;
 Verily, God is well acquainted
 With all that ye do."

54. Say: "Obey God, and obey
 The Apostle: but if ye turn
 Away, he is only responsible
 For the duty placed on him
 And ye for that placed
 On you. If ye obey him,
 Ye shall be on right guidance.
 The Apostle's duty is only
 To preach the clear (Message).

55. God has promised, to those
 Among you who believe
 And work righteous deeds, that He
 Will, of a surety, grant them
 In the land, inheritance
 (Of power), as He granted it
 To those before them; that
 He will establish in authority
 Their religion--the one
 Which He has chosen for them;
 And that He will change
 (Their state), after the fear
 In which they (lived), to one

Of security and peace:
 'They will worship Me (alone)
 And not associate aught with Me.'
 If any do reject Faith
 After this, they are
 Rebellious and wicked.

56. So establish regular Prayer
 And give regular Charity;
 And obey the Apostle;
 That ye may receive mercy.

57. Never think thou
 That the Unbelievers
 Are going to frustrate
 (God's Plan) on earth:
 Their abode is the Fire,--
 And it is indeed
 An evil refuge!

  

SECTION 8.

58. O ye who believe!
 Let those whom your right hands
 Possess, and the (children) among you

Who have not come of age
 Ask your permission (before
 They come to your presence),
 On three occasions: before
 Morning prayer; the while
 Ye doff your clothes
 For the noonday heat;
 And after the late-night prayer:
 These are your three times
 Of undress: outside those times
 It is not wrong for you
 Or for them to move about
 Attending to each other:
 Thus does God make clear
 The Signs to you: for God
 Is full of knowledge and wisdom.

59. But when the children among you
 Come of age, let them (also)
 Ask for permission, as do those
 Senior to them (in age):
 Thus does God make clear
 His Signs to you: for God
 Is full of knowledge and wisdom.

60. Such elderly women as are
 Past the prospect of marriage,--
 There is no blame on them
 If they lay aside

Their (outer) garments, provided
 They make not a wanton display
 Of their beauty: but
 It is best for them
 To be modest: and God
 Is One Who sees and knows
 All things.

61. It is no fault in the blind
 Nor in one born lame, nor
 In one afflicted with illness,
 Nor in yourselves, that ye
 Should eat in your own houses,
 Or those of your fathers,
 Or your mothers, or your brothers,
 Or your sisters, or your father's brothers
 Or your father's sisters,
 Or your mother's brothers,
 Or your mother's sisters,
 Or in houses of which
 The keys are in your possession,
 Or in the house of a sincere
 Friend of yours: there is
 No blame on you, whether
 Ye eat in company or
 Separately. But if ye
 Enter houses, salute each other--
 A greeting of blessing
 And purity as from God.

Thus does God make clear
 The Signs to you: that ye
 May understand.

  

SECTION 9.

62. Only those are Believers,
 Who believe in God and
 His Apostle: when they are
 With him on a matter
 Requiring  action,
 They do not depart until
 They have asked for his leave;
 Those who ask for thy leave
 Are those who believe in God
 And His Apostle; so when
 They ask for thy leave,
 For some business of theirs,
 Give leave to those of them
 Whom thou wilt, and ask
 God for their forgiveness:
 For God is Oft-Forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

63. Deem not the summons
 Of the Apostle among yourselves
 Like the summons of one
 Of you to another: God
 Doth know those of you
 Who slip away under shelter
 Of some excuse: then
 Let those beware who

Withstand the Apostle's order,
 Lest some trial befall them,
 Or a grievous Penalty
 Be inflicted on them.

64. Be quite sure that
 To God doth belong
 Whatever is in the heavens
 And on earth. Well doth He
 Know what ye are intent upon:
 And one day they will be
 Brought back to Him, and He
 Will tell them the truth
 Of what they did:
 For God doth know
 All things.



  

Sura XXV.

  

Furqan, or The Criterion.



1. Blessed is He Who
 Sent down the Criterion
 To His Servant, that
 May be an admonition
 To all creatures;--

2. He to Whom belongs
 The dominion of the heavens
 And the earth: no son
 Has He begotten, nor has He
 A partner in His dominion:
 It is He Who created
 All things, and ordered them
 In due proportions.

3. Yet have they taken,
 Besides Him, gods that can
 Create nothing but are themselves
 Created; that have no control
 Of hurt or good to themselves;
 Nor can they control Death
 Nor Life nor Resurrection.

4. But the Misbelievers say:
 "Naught is this but a lie
 Which he has forged,
 And others have helped him
 At it." In truth it is they
 Who have put forward
 An iniquity and a falsehood.

5. And they say: "Tales of
 The ancients, which he has caused
 To be written: and they
 Are dictated before him
 Morning and evening."

6. Say: "The (Qur-an) was sent down
 By Him Who knows
 The Mystery (that is) in the heavens
 And the earth: verily He
 Is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."

7. find they say: "What sort
 Of an apostle is this,
 Who eats food, and walks
 Through the streets? Why
 Has not an angel
 Been sent down to him
 To give admonition with him?

8. "Or (why) has not a treasure
 Been bestowed on him, or
 Why has he (not) a garden
 For enjoyment?" The wicked
 Say: "Ye follow none other
 Than a man bewitched."

9. See what kinds of comparisons
 They make for thee!
 But they have gone astray,
 And never a way will they
 Be able to find!

  

SECTION 2.

10. Blessed is He Who,
 If that were His Will,
 Could give thee better (things)
 Than those,--Gardens beneath which
 Rivers flow; and He could
 Give thee Palaces (secure
 To dwell in).

11. Nay, they deny the Hour
 (Of the Judgment to come):
 But We have prepared
 A Blazing Fire for such
 As deny the Hour:

12. When it sees them
 From a place far off,
 They will hear its fury
 And its raging sigh.

13. And when they are cast,
 Bound together, into a
 Constricted place therein, they
 Will plead for destruction
 There and then!

14. "This day plead not
 For a single destruction:
 Plead for destruction oft-repeated!"

15. Say: "Is that best, or
 The eternal Garden, promised
 To the righteous? For them,
 That is a reward as well
 As a goal (of attainment).

16. "For them there will be
 Therein all that they wish for:
 They will dwell (there) for aye:
 A promise to be prayed for
 From thy Lord."

17. The Day He will gather
 Them together as well as
 Those whom they worship
 Besides God, He will ask;

"Was it ye who led
 These My servants astray,
 Or did they stray
 From the Path themselves?"

18. They will say: "Glory to Thee!
 Not meet was it for us
 That we should take
 For protectors others besides Thee:
 But Thou didst bestow,
 On them and their fathers,
 Good things (in life), until
 They forgot the Message:
 For they were a people
 (Worthless and) lost."

19. (God will say): "Now
 Have they proved you liars
 In what ye say: so
 Ye cannot avert (your penalty)
 Nor (get) help." And whoever
 Among you does wrong,
 Him shall We cause to taste
 Of a grievous Penalty.

20. And the apostles whom We
 Sent before thee were all
 (Men) who ate food
 And walked through the streets:
 We have made some of you
 As a trial for others:
 Will ye have patience?
 For God is One Who
 Sees (all things).

  

SECTION 3.

21. Such as fear not
 The meeting with Us
 (For Judgment) say:
 "Why are not the angels
 Sent down to us, or
 (Why) do we not see
 Our Lord?" Indeed they
 Have an arrogant conceit
 Of themselves, and mighty
 Is the insolence of their impiety!

22. The Day they see the angels,--
 No joy will there be
 To the sinners that Day:
 The (angels) will say:
 "There is a barrier
 Forbidden (to you) altogether!

23: And We shall turn
 To whatever deeds they did
 (In this life), and We shall
 Make such deeds as floating dust
 Scattered about.

24. The Companions of the Garden
 Will be well, that Day,
 In their abode, and have
 The fairest of places for repose:

25. The Day the heaven shall be
 Rent asunder with clouds,
 And angels shall be sent down,
 Descending (in ranks),--

26. That Day, the dominion
 As of right and truth,
 Shall be (wholly) for (God)
 Most Merciful: it will be
 A Day of dire difficulty
 For the Misbelievers.

27. I the Day that the wrong-doer
 Will bite at his hands,
 He will say, "Oh! would that
 I had taken a (straight) path
 With the Apostle!

28. "Ah! woe is me!
 Would that I had never
 Taken such a one
 For a friend!

29. "He did lead me astray
 From the Message (of God)
 After it had come to me!
 Ah! the Evil One is
 But a traitor to man!

Then the Apostle will say:

30 "O my Lord! Truly
 My people took this Qur-an
 For just foolish nonsense."

31. Thus have We made
 For every prophet an enemy
 Among the sinners: but enough
 Is thy Lord to guide
 And to help.

32. Whose who reject Faith
 Say: "Why is not the Qur-an
 Revealed to him all at once?
 Thus (is it revealed), that We
 May strengthen thy heart
 Thereby, and We have
 Rehearsed it to thee in slow,
 Well-arranged stages, gradually.

33. And no question do they
 Bring to thee but We
 Reveal to thee the truth
 And the best explanation (thereof),

34. Whose who will be gathered
 To Hell (prone) on their faces,--
 They will be in an evil
 Plight, and, as to Path,
 Most astray.

  

SECTION 4.

35. (Before this,) We sent Moses
 The Book, and appointed
 His brother Aaron with him
 As Minister;

36. And We commanded: "Go ye
 Both, to the people who
 Have rejected our Signs:"
 And those (people) We destroyed
 With utter destruction.

37. And the people of Noah,--
 When they rejected the apostles,
 We drowned them,
 And We made them
 As a Sign for mankind;
 And We have prepared
 For (all) wrong-doers
 A grievous Penalty;--

38. As also 'Ad and Thamud,
 And the Companions

Of the Rass, and many
 A generation between them.

39. To each one We set forth
 Parables and examples;
 And each one We broke
 To utter annihilation
 (For their sins).

40. And the (Unbelievers) must indeed
 Have passed by the town
 On which was rained
 A shower of evil: did they not
 Then see it (with their own
 Eyes)? But they fear not
 The Resurrection.

41. When they see thee,
 They treat thee no otherwise
 Than in mockery: "Is this
 The one whom God has sent
 As an apostle?"

42. "He indeed would well-nigh
 Have misled us from
 Our gods, had it not been
 That we were constant
 To them!"--Soon will they
 Know, when they see
 The Penalty, who it is
 That is most misled
 In Path!

43. Seest thou such a one
 As taketh for his god
 His own passion (or impulse)?
 Couldst thou be a disposer
 Of affairs for him?

44. Or thinkest thou that most
 Of them listen or understand?
 They are only like cattle;--
 Nay, they are worse astray
 In Path.

  

SECTION 5.

45. Hast thou not turned
 Thy vision to thy Lord?--
 How He doth prolong
 The Shadow! If He willed,
 He could make it stationary!
 Then do We make
 The sun its guide;

46. Then We draw it in
 Towards Ourselves,
 A contraction by easy stages.

47. And He it is Who makes
 The Night as a Robe
 For you, and Sleep as Repose,
 And makes the Day
 (As it were) a Resurrection.

48. And He it is Who sends
 The Winds as heralds
 Of glad tidings, going before
 His Mercy, and We send down

Pure water from the sky,--

49. That with it We may give
 Life to a dead land,
 And slake the thirst
 Of things We have created,--
 Cattle and men in great numbers.

50. And We have distributed
 The (water) amongst them, in order
 That they may celebrate
 (Our) praises, but most men
 Are averse (to aught) but
 (Rank) ingratitude.

51. Had it been Our Will,
 We could have sent
 A warner to every centre
 Of population.

52. Therefore listen not
 To the Unbelievers, but strive

Against them with the utmost
 Strenuousness, with the (Qur-an).

53. It is He Who has
 Let free the two bodies
 Of flowing water:
 One palatable and sweet,
 And the other salt
 And hitter; yet has He
 Made a barrier between them,
 A partition that is forbidden
 To be passed.

54. It is He Who has
 Created man from water:
 Then has He established
 Relationships of lineage

And marriage: for thy Lord
 Has power (over all things).

55. Yet do they worship,
 Besides God, things that can
 Neither profit them nor
 Harm them: and the Misbeliever
 Is a helper (of Evil),
 Against his own Lord!

56. But thee We only sent
 To give glad tidings
 And admonition.

57. Say: "No reward do I
 Ask of you for it but this:
 That each one who will
 May take a (straight) Path
 To his Lord."

58. And put thy trust
 In Him Who lives
 And dies not; and celebrate
 His praise; and enough is He
 To be acquainted with
 The faults of His servants;--

59. He Who created the heavens
 And the earth and all
 That is between, in six days,
 And is firmly established
 On the Throne (of authority):
 God Most Gracious:
 Ask thou, then, about Him
 Of any acquainted (with such things).

60. When it is said to them,
 "Adore ye (God) Most Gracious!",
 They say, "And what is (God)
 Most Gracious? Shall we adore
 That which thou commandest us?"
 And it increases their flight
 (From the Truth).

  

SECTION 6

61. Blessed is He Who made
 Constellations in the skies,
 And placed therein a Lamp
 And a Moon giving light;

62. And it is He Who made
 The Night and the Day
 To follow each other:
 For such as have the will
 To celebrate His praises
 Or to show their gratitude.

63. And the servants of (God)
 Most Gracious are those
 Who walk on the earth
 In humility, and when the ignorant
 Address them, they say,
 "Peace!";

64. Those who spend the night
 In adoration of their Lord
 Prostrate and standing;

65. Those who say, "Our Lord!
 Avert from us the Wrath
 Of Hell, for its Wrath
 Is indeed an affliction grievous,--

66. "Evil indeed is it
 As an abode, and as
 A place to rest in";

67. Those who, when they spend,
 Are not extravagant and not
 Niggardly, but hold a just (balance)
 Between those (extremes);

68. Those who invoke not,
 With God, any other god,
 Nor slay such life as God
 Has made sacred, except
 For just cause, nor commit
 Fornication;--and any that does
 This (not only) meets punishment

69. (But) the Penalty on the Day
 Of Judgment will be doubled
 To him, and he will dwell
 Therein in ignominy,--

70. Unless he repents, believes,
 And works righteous deeds,
 For God will change
 The evil of such persons
 Into good, and God is
 Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful,

71. And whoever repents and does good
 Has truly turned to God
 With an (acceptable) conversion;--

72. Those who witness no falsehood;
 And, if they pass by futility,
 They pass by it
 With honourable (avoidance);

73. Those who, when they are
 Admonished with the Signs
 Of their Lord, droop not down
 At them as if they were
 Deaf or blind;

74. And these who pray,
 "Our Lord! Grant unto us
 Wives and offspring who will be
 The comfort of our eyes,

And give us (the grace)
 To lead the righteous."

75. Those are the ones who
 Will be rewarded with
 The highest place in heaven,
 Because of their patient constancy:
 Therein shall they be met
 With salutations and peace,

76. Dwelling therein;--how beautiful
 An abode and place of rest!

77. Say (to the Rejecters):
 "My Lord is not uneasy
 Because of you if ye call not on Him
 But ye have indeed rejected
 (Him), and soon will come
 The inevitable (punishment)!"



  

Sura XXVI.

  

Shu'araa, or The Poets.



1. Ta. Sin. Mim.

2. These are Verses of the Book
 That makes (things) clear.

3. It may be thou frettest
 Thy soul with grief, that they
 Do not become Believers.

4. If (such) were Our Will,
 We could send down to them
 From the sky a Sign,
 To which they would bend
 Their necks in humility.

5. But there comes not
 To them a newly-revealed
 Message from (God) Most Gracious,
 But they turn away therefrom.

6. They have indeed rejected
 (The Message): so they will
 Know soon (enough) the truth
 Of what they mocked at!

7. Do they not look
 At the earth,--how many
 Noble things of all kinds
 We have produced therein?

8. Verily, in this is a Sign:
 But most of them
 Do not believe.

9. And verily, thy Lord
 Is He, the Exalted in Might,
 Most Merciful.

  

SECTION 2.

10. Behold, thy Lord called
 Moses: "Go to the people
 Of iniquity,--

11. "The people of Pharaoh:
 Will they not fear God?"

12. He said: "O my Lord!
 I do fear that they
 Will charge me with falsehood:

13. "My breast will be straitened?'
 And my speech may not go
 (Smoothly): so send unto Aaron.

14. "And (further), they have
 A charge of crime against me;
 And I fear they may
 Slay me."

15. God said: "By no means!
 Proceed then, both of you,
 With Our Signs; We
 Are with you, and will
 Listen (to your call).

16. "So go forth, both of you,
 To Pharaoh, and say:
 'We have been sent
 By the Lord and Cherisher
 Of the Worlds;

17. "'Send thou with us
 The Children of Israel.'"

18. (Pharaoh) said: "Did we not
 Cherish thee as a child
 Among us, and didst thou not
 Stay in our midst
 Many years of thy life?

19. "And thou didst a deed
 Of thine which (thou knowest)
 Thou didst, and thou art
 An ungrateful (wretch)!"

20. Moses said: "I did it
 Then, when I was
 In error.

21. "So I fled from you (all)
 When I feared you;
 But my Lord has (since)
 Invested me with judgment
 (And wisdom) and appointed me
 As one of the apostles.

22. "And this is the favour
 With which thou dost
 Reproach me,--that thou
 Hast enslaved the Children
 Of Israel!"

23. Pharaoh said: "And what
 Is the 'Lord and Cherisher
 Of the Worlds'?

24. (Moses) said: "The Lord
 And Cherisher of the heavens
 And the earth, and all between,
 If ye want to be
 Quite sure."

25. (Pharaoh) said to those
 Around: "Do ye not listen
 (To what he says)?

26. (Moses) said: "Your Lord
 And the Lord of your fathers
 From the beginning!"

27. (Pharaoh) said: "Truly
 Your apostle who has been
 Sent to you is
 A veritable madman!"

28. (Moses) said: "Lord of the East
 And the West, and all between!
 If ye only had sense!"

29. (Pharaoh) said: "If thou
 Dost put forward any god
 Other than me, I will
 Certainly put thee in prison!"

30. (Moses) said: "Even if I
 Showed you something
 Clear (and) convincing?"

31. (Pharaoh) said: "Show it then,
 If thou tellest the truth!"

32. So (Moses) threw his rod,
 And behold, it was
 A serpent, plain (for all to see)!

33. And he drew out his hand,
 And behold, it was white
 To all beholders!

  

SECTION 3.

34. (Pharaoh) said to the Chiefs
 Around him: "This is indeed
 A sorcerer well-versed:

35. "His plan is to get you out
 Of your land by his sorcery;
 Then what is it ye counsel?"

36. They said: "Keep him
 And his brother in suspense
 (For a while), and dispatch
 To the Cities heralds to collect--

37. "And bring up to thee
 All (our) sorcerers well-versed."

38. So the sorcerers were got
 Together for the appointment
 Of a day well-known,

39. And the people were told:
 "Are ye (now) assembled?--

40. "That we may follow
 The sorcerers (in religion)
 If they win?"

41. So when the sorcerers arrived,
 They said to Pharaoh:
 "Of course--shall we have
 A (suitable) reward
 If we win?"

42. He said: "Yea, (and more),--
 For ye shall in that case
 Be (raised to posts)
 Nearest (to my person)."

43. Moses said to them:
 "Throw ye--that which
 Ye are about to throw!"

44. So they threw their ropes
 And their rods, and said:
 "By the might of Pharaoh,
 It is we who will
 Certainly win!"

45. Then Moses threw his rod,
 When, behold, it straightway
 Swallows up all
 The falsehoods which they fake!

46. When did the sorcerers
 Fall down, prostrate in adoration,

47. Saying: "We believe
 In the Lord of the Worlds,

48. "The Lord of Moses and Aaron."

49. Said (Pharaoh): "Believe ye
 In Him before I give
 You permission? Surely he
 Is your leader, who has
 Taught you sorcery!
 But soon shall ye know!

50. "Be sure I will cut off
 Your hands and your feet
 On opposite sides, and I
 Will cause you all
 To die on the cross!"

51. They said: "No matter!
 For us, we shall but
 Return to our Lord!

52. "Only, our desire is
 That our Lord will
 Forgive us our faults,
 That we may become
 Foremost among the Believers!"

  

SECTION 4.

53. By inspiration We told Moses:
 "Travel by night with
 My servants; for surely
 Ye shall be pursued."

54. Then Pharaoh sent heralds
 To (all) the Cities,

55. (Saying): "These (Israelites)
 Are but a small band,

56. "And they are raging
 Furiously against us;

57. "But we are a multitude
 Amply fore-warned."

58. So We expelled them
 From gardens, springs,

59. Treasures, and every kind
 Of honourable position;

60. Thus it was, but
 We made the Children
 Of Israel inheritors
 Of such things.

61. So they pursued them
 At sunrise.

62. And when the two bodies
 Saw each other, the people
 Of Moses said: "We are
 Sure to be overtaken."

63. (Moses) said: "By no means!
 My Lord is with me!
 Soon will He guide me!"

64. Then We told Moses
 By inspiration: "Strike
 The sea with thy rod."
 So it divided, and each
 Separate part became
 Like the huge, firm mass
 Of a mountain.

65. And We made the other
 Party approach thither.

66. We delivered Moses and all
 Who were with him;

67. But We drowned the others.

68. Verily in this is a Sign:
 But most of them
 Do not believe.

69. And verily thy Lord
 Is He, the Exalted in Might,
 Most Merciful.

  

SECTION 5.

70. And rehearse to them
 (Something of) Abraham's story.

71. Behold, he said
 To his father and his people:
 "What worship ye?"

72. They said: "We worship
 Idols, and we remain constantly
 In attendance on them."

73. He said: "Do they listen
 To you when ye call (on them),
 Or do you good or harm?"

74. They said: "Nay, but we
 Found our fathers doing
 Thus (what we do)."

75. He said: "Do ye then
 See whom ye have been
 Worshipping,--

76. "Ye and your fathers before you?--

77. "For they are enemies to me;
 Not so the Lord and Cherisher
 Of the Worlds;

78. "Who created me, and
 It is He who guides me;

79. "Who gives me food and drink,

80. "And when I am ill,
 It is He who cures me;

81. "Who will cause me to die,
 And then to live (again);

82. "And who, I hope,
 Will forgive me my faults
 On the Day of Judgment.

83. "O my Lord! bestow wisdom
 On me, and join me
 With the righteous;

84. "Grant me honourable mention
 On the tongue of truth
 Among the latest (generations);

85. "Make me one of the inheritors
 Of the Garden of Bliss;

86. "Forgive my father, for that
 He is among those astray;

87. "And let me not be
 In disgrace on the Day
 When (men) will be raised up;--

88. "The Day whereon neither
 Wealth nor sons will avail,

89. "But only he (will prosper)
 That brings to God
 A sound heart;

90. "To the righteous, the Garden
 Will be brought near,

91. "And to those straying in Evil,
 The Fire will be placed
 In full view;

92. "And it shall be said
 To them, 'Where are
 The (gods) ye worshipped--

93. "'Besides God? Can they
 Help you or help themselves?'

94. "Then they will be thrown
 Headlong into the (Fire),--
 They and those straying
 In Evil,

95. "And the whole hosts
 Of Iblis together.

96. "They will say there
 In their mutual bickerings:

97. "'By God, we were truly
 In an error manifest,

98. "'When we held you as equals
 With the Lord of the Worlds;

99. "'And our seducers were
 Only those who were
 Steeped in guilt.

100. "'Now, then, we have none
 To intercede (for us),

101. "'Nor a single friend
 To feel (for us).

102. "'Now if we only had
 A chance of return,
 We shall truly be
 Of those who believe!'"

103. Verily in this is a Sign
 But most of them
 Do not believe.

104. And verily thy Lord
 Is He, the Exalted in Might,
 Most Merciful.

  

SECTION 6.

105. The people of Noah rejected
 The apostles.

106. Behold, their brother Noah
 Said to them: "Will ye not
 Fear (God)?

107. "I am to you an apostle
 Worthy of all trust:

108. "So fear God, and obey me.

109. "No reward do I ask
 Of you for it: my reward
 Is only from the Lord
 Of the Worlds:

110. "So fear God, and obey me."

111. They said: "Shall we
 Believe in thee when it is
 The meanest that follow thee?"

112. He said: "And what
 Do I know as to
 What they do?

113. "Their account is only
 With my Lord, if ye
 Could (but) understand.

114. "I am not one to drive away
 Those who believe.

115. "I am sent only
 To warn plainly in public."

116. They said: "If thou
 Desist not, O Noah!
 Thou shalt be stoned
 (to death)."

117. He said: "O my Lord!
 Truly my people have
 Rejected me.

118. "Judge thou, then, between me
 And them openly, and deliver

Me and those of the Believers
 Who are with me."

119. So We delivered him
 And those with him,
 In the Ark filled
 (With all creatures).

120. Thereafter We drowned those
 Who remained behind.

121. Verily in this is a Sign:
 But most of them
 Do not believe.

122. And verily thy Lord
 Is He, the Exalted in Might,
 Most Merciful.

  

SECTION 7.

123. The 'Ad (people) rejected'
 The apostles.

124. Behold, their brother Hud
 Said to them: "Will ye not
 Fear (God)?

125. "I am to you an apostle
 Worthy of all trust:

126. "So fear God and obey me.

127. "No reward do I ask
 Of you for it my reward
 Is only from the Lord
 Of the Worlds.

128. "Do ye build a landmark
 On every high place
 To amuse yourselves?

129. "And do ye get for yourselves
 Fine buildings in the hope
 Of living therein (for ever)?

130. "And when ye exert
 Your strong hand,
 Do ye do it like men
 Of absolute power?

131. "Now fear God, and obey me.

132. "Yea, fear Him Who
 Has bestowed on you
 Freely all that ye know.

133. "Freely has He bestowed
 On you cattle and sons,--

134. "And Gardens and Springs.

135. "Truly I fear for you
 The Penalty of a Great Day."

136. They said: "It is the same
 To us whether thou
 Admonish us or be not
 Among (our) admonishers!

137. "This is no other than
 A customary device
 Of the ancients,

138. "And we are not the ones
 To receive Pains and Penalties!"

139. So they rejected him,
 And We destroyed them.
 Verily in this is a Sign:
 But most of them
 Do not believe.

140. And verily thy Lord
 Is He, the Exalted in Might,
 Most Merciful.

  

SECTION 8.

141. The Thamud (people) rejected
 The apostles.

142. Behold, their brother Salih
 Said to them: "Will you not
 Fear (God)?

143. "I am to you an apostle
 Worthy of all trust.

144. "So fear God, and obey me.

145. "No reward do I ask
 Of you for it: my reward
 Is only from the Lord
 Of the Worlds.

146. "Will ye be left secure,
 In (the enjoyment of) all
 That ye have here?--

147. "Gardens and Springs,

148. "And corn-fields and date palms
 With spathes near breaking
 (With the weight of fruit)?

149. "And ye carve houses
 Out of (rocky) mountains
 With great skill.

150. "But fear God and obey me;

151. "And follow not the bidding
 Of those who are extravagant,--

152. "Who make mischief in the land,
 And mend not (their ways)."

153. Whey said: "Thou art only
 One of those bewitched!'

154. "Thou art no more than
 A mortal like us:
 Then bring us a Sign,
 If thou tellest the truth!"

155. He said: "Here is
 A she-camel: she has
 A right of watering,
 And ye have a right
 Of watering, (severally)
 On a day appointed.

156. "Touch her not with harm,
 Lest the Penalty
 Of a Great Day
 Seize you."

157. But they ham-strung her:
 Then did they become
 Full of regrets.

158. But the Penalty seized them.
 Verily in this is a Sign:
 But most of them
 Do not believe.

159. And verily thy Lord
 Is He, the Exalted in Might,
 Most Merciful.

  

SECTION 9

160. The people of Lut rejected'
 The apostles.

161. Behold, their brother Lut
 Said to them: "Will ye not
 Fear (God)?

162. "I am to you an apostle
 Worthy of all trust.

163. "So fear God and obey me.

164. "No reward do I ask
 Of you for it my reward
 Is only from the Lord
 Of the Worlds.

165. "Of all the creatures
 In the world, will ye
 Approach males,

166. "And leave those whom God
 Has created for you
 To be your mates?
 Nay, ye are a people
 Transgressing (all limits)!"

167. Whey said: "If thou desist not,
 O Lut! thou wilt assuredly
 Be cast out!"

168. He said: "I do detest
 Your doings:"

169. "O my Lord! deliver me
 And my family from
 Such things as they do!"

170. So We delivered him
 And his family,--all

171. Except an old woman
 Who lingered behind.

172. But the rest We destroyed Utterly.

173. We rained down on them
 A shower (of brimstone):
 And evil was the shower
 On those who were admonished
 (But heeded not)!

174. Verily in this is a Sign
 But most of them
 Do not believe.

175. And verily thy Lord
 Is He, the Exalted in Might
 Most Merciful.

  

SECTION 10.

176. The Companions of the Wood
 Rejected the apostles.

177. Behold, Shu'aib said to them:
 Will ye not fear (God)?

178. "I am to you an apostle
 Worthy of all trust.

179. "So fear God and obey me.

180. "No reward do I ask
 Of you for it: my, reward
 Is only from the Lord
 Of the Worlds.

181. "Give just measure,''
 And cause no loss
 (To others by fraud).

182. "And weigh with scales
 True and upright.

183. "And withhold not things
 Justly due to men,
 Nor do evil in the land,
 Working mischief.

184. "And fear Him Who created
 You and (Who created)
 The generations before (you)"

185. Whey said: "Thou art only
 One of those bewitched!

186. "Thou art no more than
 A mortal like us,
 And indeed we think
 Thou art a liar!

187. "Now cause a piece
 Of the sky to fall on us,
 If thou art truthful!"

188. He said: "My Lord
 Knows best what ye do."

189. But they rejected him.
 Then the punishment
 Of a day of overshadowing gloom
 Seized them, and that was
 The Penalty of a Great Day.

190. Verily in that is a Sign:
 But most of them
 Do not believe.

191. And verily thy Lord
 Is He, the Exalted in Might,
 Most Merciful.

  

SECTION 11.

192. Verily this is a Revelation
 From the Lord of the Worlds:

193. With it came down
 The Spirit of Faith and Truth--

194. To thy heart and mind,
 That thou mayest admonish

195. In the perspicuous
 Arabic tongue.

196. Without doubt it is (announced)
 In the mystic Book
 Of former peoples.

197. Is it not a Sign
 To them that the Learned
 Of the Children of Israel
 Knew it (as true)?

198. Had We revealed it
 To any of the non Arabs,

199. And had he recited it
 To them, they would not
 Have believed in it.

200. Thus have We caused it
 To enter the hearts
 Of the Sinners.

201. They will not believe
 In it until they see
 The grievous Penalty;

202. But the (Penalty) will come
 To them of a sudden,
 While they preceive it not;

203. Then they will say:
 "Shall we be respited?"

204. Do they then ask
 For Our Penalty to be
 Hastened on?

205. Seest thou? If We do
 Let them enjoy (this life)
 For a few years,

206. Yet there comes to them
 At length the (Punishment)
 Which they were promised!

207. It will profit them not
 That they enjoyed (this life)!

208. Never did We destroy
 A population, but had
 Its warners--

209. By way of reminder;
 And We never are unjust.

210. No evil ones have brought
 Down this (Revelation):

211. It would neither suit them
 Nor would they be able
 (To produce it).

212. Indeed they have been removed
 Far from even (a chance of)
 Hearing it.

213. So call not on any
 Other god with God,
 Or thou wilt be among
 Those under the Penalty.

214. And admonish thy nearest
 Kinsmen,

215. And lower thy wing
 To the Believers who
 Follow thee.

216. Then if they disobey thee,
 Say: "I am free (of responsibility)
 For what ye do!"

217. And put thy trust
 On the Exalted in Might,
 The Merciful,--

218. Who seeth thee standing
 Forth (in prayer),

219. And thy movements among
 Those who prostrate themselves.

220. For it is He
 Who heareth and knoweth
 All things.

221. Shall I inform you.
 (O people!), on whom it is
 That the evil ones descend?

222. They descend on every
 Lying, wicked person,

223. (Into whose ears) they pour
 Hearsay vanities, and most
 Of them are liars.

224. And the Poets,--
 It is those straying in Evil,
 Who follow them:

225. Seest thou not that they
 Wander distracted in every
 Valley?--

226. And that they say
 What they practise not?--

227. Except those who believe,
 Work righteousness, engage much

In the remembrance of God,
 And defend themselves only after
 They are unjustly attacked.
 And soon will the unjust'
 Assailants know what vicissitudes
 Their affairs will take!



  

Sura XXVII.

  

Naml, or the Ants.



1. Ta. Sin.
 These are verses
 Of the Qur-an,--a Book
 That makes (things) clear;

2. A Guide; and Glad Tidings
 For the Relievers,--

3. Those who establish regular prayers
 And give in regular charity,
 And also have (full) assurance
 Of the Hereafter.

4. As to those who believe not
 In the Hereafter, We have
 Made their deeds pleasing
 In their eyes; and so they
 Wander about in distraction.

5. Such are they for whom
 A grievous Penalty is (waiting):
 And in the Hereafter theirs
 Will be the greatest loss.

6. As to thee, the Qur-an
 Is bestowed upon thee
 From the presence of One
 Who is Wise and All-Knowing.

7. Behold! Moses said
 To his family "I perceive
 A fire; soon will I bring you
 From there some information,
 Or I will bring you
 A burning brand to light
 Our fuel, that ye may
 Warm yourselves.

8. But when he came
 To the (Fire), a voice
 Was heard: "Blessed are those
 In the Fire and those around:
 And Glory to God,
 The Lord of the Worlds.

9. "O Moses! Verily,
 I am God, the Exalted
 In Might, the Wise!...

10. "Now do thou throw thy rod!"
 But when he saw it
 Moving (of its own accord)
 As if it had been a snake,
 He turned back in retreat,
 And retraced not his steps:
 "O Moses!" (it was said),
 "Fear not: truly, in My presence,
 Those called as apostles
 Have no fear,--

11. "But if any have done wrong
 And have thereafter substituted
 Good to take the place of evil,
 Truly, I am Oft-Forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

12. "Now put thy hand into
 Thy bosom, and it will
 Come forth white without stain
 (Or harm): (these are) among
 The nine Signs (thou wilt take)
 To Pharaoh and his people:
 For they are a people
 Rebellious in transgression."

13. But when Our Signs came
 To them, that should have""
 Opened their eyes, they said:
 "This is sorcery manifest!"

14. And they rejected those Signs
 In iniquity and arrogance,
 Though their souls were convinced
 Thereof: so see what was
 The end of those
 Who acted corruptly!

  

SECTION 2.

15. We gave (in the past)
 Knowledge to David and Solomon
 And they both said:
 "Praise be to God, Who
 Has favoured us above many
 Of His servants who believe!

16. And Solomon was David's heir.
 He said: "O ye people!
 We have been taught the speech"
 Of Birds, and on us
 Has been bestowed (a little)
 Of all things: this is
 Indeed Grace manifest (from God.)"

17. And before Solomon were marshalled

His hosts,--of Jinns and men
 And birds, and they were all
 Kept in order and ranks.

18. At length, when they came
 To a (lowly) valley of ants,
 One of the ants said:
 "O ye ants, get into
 Your habitations, lest Solomon
 And his hosts crush you
 (Under foot) without knowing it."

19. So he smiled, amused
 At her speech; and he said:
 "O my Lord! so order me
 That I may be grateful
 For Thy favours, which Thou
 Hast bestowed on me and
 On my parents, and that
 I may work the righteousness
 That will please Thee:
 And admit me, by Thy Grace,
 To the ranks of Thy
 Righteous Servants."

20. And he took a muster
 Of the Birds; and he said:
 "Why is it I see not
 The Hoopoe? Or is he
 Among the absentees?"

21. "I will certainly punish him
 With a severe penalty,
 Or execute him, unless he
 Bring me a clear reason
 (For absence)."

22. But the Hoopoe tarried not
 Far: he (came up and) said:
 "I have compassed (territory)
 Which thou hast not compassed,
 And I have come to thee
 From Saba with tidings true.

23. "I found (there) a woman
 Ruling over them and provided
 With every requisite; and she
 Has a magnificent throne.

24. "I found her and her people
 Worshipping the sun besides God:
 Satan has made their deeds
 Seem pleasing in their eyes,
 And has kept them away
 From the Path,--so
 They receive no guidance,--

25. "(Kept them away from the Path),
 That they should not worship
 God, Who brings to light
 What is hidden in the heavens
 And the earth, and knows
 What ye hide and what
 Ye reveal.

26. "God!--there is no god
 But He!--Lord of the Throne's
 Supreme!"

27. (Solomon) said: "Soon shall we
 See whether thou hast told
 The truth or lied!

28. "Go thou, with this letter
 Of mine, and deliver it
 To them: then draw back
 From them, and (wait to) see
 What answer they return"...

29. (The Queen) said: "Ye chiefs!
 Here is--delivered to me--
 A letter worthy of respect.

30. "It is from Solomon, and is
 (As follows), 'In the name
 Of God, Most Gracious,
 Most Merciful:

31. "'Be ye not arrogant
 Against me, but come
 To me in submission
 (To the true Religion).'"

  

SECTION 3.

32. the said: "Ye chiefs!
 Advise me in (this)
 My affair: no affair
 Have I decided
 Except in your presence."

33. They said: "We are endued
 With strength, and given
 To vehement war:
 But the command is
 With thee; so consider
 What thou wilt command."

34. She said: "Kings, when they
 Enter a country, despoil it,

And make the noblest
 Of its people its meanest
 Thus do they behave.

35. "But I am going to send
 Him a present, and (wait)
 To see with what (answer)
 Return (my) ambassadors."

36. Now when (the embassy) came
 To Solomon, he said:
 "Will ye give me abundance
 In wealth? But that which
 God has given me is better
 Than that which He has
 Given you! Nay it is ye
 Who rejoice in your gift!

37. "Go back to them, and be sure
 We shall come to them
 With such hosts as they
 Will never be able to meet:
 We shall expel them
 From there in disgrace,
 And they will feel
 Humbled (indeed)."

38. He said (to his own men):
 "Ye Chiefs! which of you
 Can bring me her throne
 Before they come to me
 In submission?"

39. Said an 'Ifrit, of the Jinns:
 "I will bring it to thee

Before thou rise from thy
 Council: indeed I have
 Full strength for the purpose,
 And may he trusted."

40. Said one who had knowledge
 Of the Book: "I will
 Bring it to thee within
 The twinkling of an eye!"
 Then when (Solomon) saw it
 Placed firmly before him,
 He said: "This is
 By the grace of my Lord!
 To test me whether I am
 Grateful or ungrateful!
 And if any is grateful,
 Truly his gratitude is (a gain)
 For his own soul; hut if
 Any is ungrateful, truly
 My Lord is Free of all Needs,
 Supreme in Honour!"

41. He said: "Transform her throne
 Out of all recognition by her:
 Let us see whether she
 Is guided (to the truth)

Or is one of those who
 Receive no guidance."

42. So when she arrived,
 She was asked, "Is this
 Thy throne?" She said,
 "It was just like this;
 And knowledge was bestowed
 On us in advance of this,
 And we have submitted
 To God (in Islam)."

43. And he diverted her
 From the worship of others
 Besides God: for she was
 (Sprung) of a people
 That had no faith.

44. She was asked to enter
 The lofty Palace: but
 When she saw it, she
 Thought it was a lake
 Of water, and she (tucked up
 Her skirts), uncovering her legs.
 He said: "This is
 But a palace paved

Smooth with slabs of glass."
 She said: "O my Lord!
 I have indeed wronged"
 My soul: I do (now)
 Submit (in Islam), with Solomon,
 To the Lord of the Worlds."

  

SECTION 4.

45. We sent (aforetime),
 To the Thamud, their brother
 Salih, saying, "Serve God":
 But behold, they became
 Two factions quarrelling
 With each other.

46. He said: "O my people!
 Why ask ye to hasten on

The evil in preference to the good?
 If only ye ask God for forgiveness,
 Ye may hope to receive mercy.

47. They said: "Ill omen
 Do we augur from thee
 And those that are with thee".
 He said: "Your ill omen
 Is with God; yea, ye are
 A people under trial."

48. There were in the City
 Nine men of a family,
 Who made mischief in the land,
 And would not reform.

49. They said: "Swear
 A mutual oath by God
 That we shall make
 A secret night attack
 On him and his people,
 And that we shall then
 Say to his heir (when he
 Seeks vengeance), 'We were not
 Present at the slaughter
 Of his people, and we are
 Positively telling the truth'."

50. They plotted and planned,
 But We too planned,
 Even while they perceived it not.

51. Then see what was the end
 Of their plot!--this,
 That We destroyed them
 And their people, all (of them).

52. Now such were their houses,--
 In utter ruin,--because
 They practised wrong-doing.
 Verily in this is a Sign
 For people of knowledge.

53. And We saved those
 Who believed and practised
 Righteousness.

54. (We also sent) Lut
 (As an apostle): behold,
 He said to his people,
 "Do ye do what is shameful
 Though ye see (its iniquity)?

55. Would ye really approach men
 In your lusts rather than
 Women? Nay, ye are
 A people (grossly) ignorant!

56. But his people gave
 No other answer but this:
 They said, "Drive out

The followers of Lut from
 Your city: these are
 Indeed men who want
 To be clean and pure!"

57. But We saved him
 And his family, except
 His wife: her We destined
 To be of those
 Who lagged behind.

58. And We rained down on them
 A shower (of brimstone):
 And evil was the shower
 On those who were admonished
 (But heeded not)!

  

SECTION 5.

59. Say: Praise be to God,
 And Peace on His servants
 Whom He has chosen
 (For His Message). (Who)
 Is better?--God or
 The false gods they associate
 (With Him)?

60. Or, who has created
 The heavens and the earth,
 And who sends you down
 Rain from the sky?
 Yea, with it We cause
 To grow well-planted orchards
 Full of beauty and delight:
 It is not in your power
 To cause the growth
 Of the trees in them. (Can there be
 Another) god besides God?
 Nay, they are a people
 Who swerve from justice.

61. Or, who has made the earth
 Firm to live in; made
 Rivers in its midst; set
 Thereon mountains immovable;
 And made a separating bar
 Between the two bodies
 Of flowing water?
 (Can there be another) god
 Besides God? Nay, most
 Of them know not.

62. Or, who listens to the (soul)
 Distressed when it calls
 On Him, and who relieves
 Its suffering, and makes you

(Mankind) inheritors of the earth?'
 (Can there be another) god
 Besides God? Little it is
 That ye heed!

63. Or, who guides you
 Through the depths of darkness
 On land and sea, and who
 Sends the winds as heralds
 Of glad tidings, going before
 His Mercy? (Can there be
 Another) god besides God?--
 High is God above what
 They associate with Him!

64. Or, who originates Creation,
 Then repeats it,
 And who gives you sustenance
 From heaven and earth?
 (Can there be another) god
 Besides God? Say, "Bring forth
 Your argument, if ye
 Are telling the truth!"

65. Say: None in the heavens
 Or on earth, except God,
 Knows what is hidden:
 Nor can they perceive
 When they shall be raised
 Up (for Judgment).

66. Still less can their knowledge
 Comprehend the Hereafter: nay,

They are in doubt and uncertainty
 Thereanent; nay, they are blind
 Thereunto!

  

SECTION 6.

67. The Unbelievers say: "What!
 When we become dust,
 We and our fathers,--shall we
 Really be raised (from the dead)?

68. "It is true we were promised
 This,--we and our fathers
 Before (us): these are nothing
 But tales of the ancients."

69. Say: "Go ye through the earth
 And see what has been
 The end of those guilty
 (Of sin)."

70. But grieve not over them,
 Nor distress thyself
 Because of their plots.

71. They also say: "When will
 This promise (come to pass)?
 (Say) if ye are truthful."

72. Say: "It may be that
 Some of the events which
 Ye wish to hasten on
 May be (close) in your pursuit!"

73. But verily thy Lord is
 Full of grace to mankind:
 Yet most of them are ungrateful.

74. And verily thy Lord knoweth
 All that their hearts do hide,
 As well as all that
 They reveal.

75. Nor is there aught
 Of the Unseen, in heaven
 Or earth, but is (recorded)
 In a clear record.

76. Verily this Qur-an doth explain
 To the Children of Israel
 Most of the matters
 In which they disagree.

77. And it certainly is
 A Guide and a Mercy
 To those who believe.

78. Verily thy Lord will decide
 Between them by His Decree:
 And He is Exalted in Might,
 All-Knowing.

79. So put thy trust in God:
 For thou art on (the Path
 Of) manifest Truth.

80. Truly thou canst not cause
 The Dead to listen, nor
 Canst thou cause the Deaf
 To hear the call,
 (Especially) when they
 Turn back in retreat.

81. Nor canst thou be a guide
 To the Blind, (to prevent them)
 From straying: only those
 Wilt thou get to listen
 Who believe in Our Signs,
 And they will bow in Islam.

82. And when the Word is
 Fulfilled against them (the unjust),
 We shall produce from the earth
 A Beast to (face) them:
 He will speak to them,
 For that mankind did not
 Believe with assurance
 In Our Signs.

  

SECTION 7.

83. One Day We shall gather
 Together from every people
 A troop of those who reject
 Our Signs, and they shall
 Be kept in ranks,--

84. Until, when they come
 (Before the Judgment-seat),
 (God) will say: "Did ye
 Reject My Signs, though ye

Comprehended them not
 In knowledge, or what
 Was it ye did?"

85. And the Word will be
 Fulfilled against them, because
 Of their wrong-doing, and they
 Will be unable to speak
 (In plea).

86. See they not that We
 Have made the Night
 For them to rest in
 And the Day to give
 Them light? Verily in this
 Are Signs for any people 
 That believe!

87. And the Day that the Trumpet
 Will be sounded--then will be
 Smitten with terror those
 Who are in the heavens,
 And those who are on earth,
 Except such as God will please
 (To exempt): and all shall come
 To His (Presence) as beings
 Conscious of their lowliness.

88. Thou seest the mountains
 And thinkest them firmly fixed:
 But they shall pass away
 As the clouds pass away:

(Such is) the artistry of God,
 Who disposes of all things
 In perfect order: for He is
 Well acquainted with all that ye do.

89. If any do good, good will
 (Accrue) to them therefrom;
 And they will be secure
 From terror that Day.

90. And if any do evil,
 Their faces will be thrown
 Headlong into the Fire:
 "Do ye receive a reward
 Other than that which ye
 Have earned by your deeds?"

91. For me, I have been
 Commanded to serve the Lord
 Of this City, Him Who has
 Sanctified it and to Whom
 (Belong) all things:
 And I am commanded
 To be of those who bow
 In Islam to God's Will,--

92. And to rehearse the Qur-an:
 And if any accept guidance,

They do it for the good
 Of their own souls,
 And if any stray, say:
 "I am only a Warner".

93. And say: "Praise be to God,
 Who will soon show you
 His Signs, so that ye
 Shall know them"; and thy Lord
 Is not unmindful
 Of all that ye do.



  

Sura XXVIII.

  

Qasas, or the Narration.



1. Ta. Sin. Mim.

2. These are Verses of the Book
 That makes (things) clear.

3. We rehearse to thee some
 Of the story of Moses
 And Pharaoh in Truth,
 For people who believe.

4. Truly Pharaoh elated himself
 In the land and broke up
 Its people into sections,
 Depressing a small group
 Among them: their sons he slew,
 But he kept alive their females:
 For he was indeed
 A maker of mischief.

5. And We wished to be
 Gracious to those who were
 Being depressed in the land,
 To make them leaders (in faith)
 And make them heirs,

6. To establish a firm place
 For them in the land,
 And to show Pharaoh, Haman,
 And their hosts, at their hands,
 The very things against which
 They were taking precautions.

7. So We sent this inspiration
 To the mother of Moses:
 "Suckle (thy child), but when
 Thou hast fears about him,
 Cast him into the river,
 But fear not nor grieve:
 For We shall restore him
 To thee, and We shall make
 Him one of Our apostles."

8. Then the people of Pharaoh
 Picked him up (from the river):
 (It was intended) that (Moses)
 Should be to them an adversary
 And a cause of sorrow:
 For Pharaoh and Haman
 And (all) their hosts were
 Men of sin.

9. The wife of Pharaoh said:
 "(Here is) a joy of the eye,'
 For me and for thee:
 Slay him not. It may be

That he will be of use
 To us, or we may adopt
 Him as a son." And they
 Perceived not (what they
 Were doing)!

10. But there came to be
 A void in the heart
 Of the mother of Moses:
 She was going almost to
 Disclose his (case), had We
 Not strengthened her heart
 (With faith), so that she
 Might remain a (firm) believer.

11. And she said to the sister
 Of (Moses), "Follow him".
 So she (the sister) watched him
 In the character of a stranger.
 And they knew not.

12. And We ordained that he
 Refused suck at first, until
 (His sister came up
 And) said: "Shall I
 Point out to you the people
 Of a house that will nourish
 And bring him up for you'"
 And be sincerely attached
 To him?"...

13. Thus did We restore him
 To his mother, that her eye
 Might be comforted, that she
 Might not grieve, and that
 She might know that the promise
 Of God is true: but
 Most of them do not understand.

  

SECTION 2.

14. When he reached full age,
 And was firmly established
 (In life), We bestowed on him
 Wisdom and knowledge: for thus
 Do We reward those
 Who do good.

15. And he entered the City
 At a time when its people
 Were not watching: and he
 Found there two men fighting,--
 One of his own religion,
 And the other, of his foes.
 Now the man of his own
 Religion appealed to him
 Against his foe, and Moses
 Struck him with his fist
 And made an end of him.
 He said: "This is a work
 Of Evil (Satan): for he is
 An enemy that manifestly
 Misleads!"

16. He prayed: "O my Lord!
 I have indeed wronged my soul!
 Do Thou then forgive me!"
 So (God) forgave him: for He
 Is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

17. He said: "O my Lord!
 For that Thou hast bestowed
 Thy Grace on me, never
 Shall I be a help
 To those who sin!"

18. So he saw the morning
 In the City, looking about,
 In a state of fear, when
 Behold, the man who had,
 The day before, sought his help
 Called aloud for his help
 (Again). Moses said to him:
 "Thou art truly, it is clear,
 A quarrelsome fellow!"

19. Then, when he decided to lay
 Hold of the man who was
 An enemy to both of them,
 That man said: "O Moses!
 Is it thy intention to slay me
 As thou slewest a man
 Yesterday? Thy intention is
 None other than to become
 A powerful violent man
 In the land, and not to be
 One who sets things right!

20. And there came a man,
 Running, from the furthest end
 Of the City. He said:
 "O Moses! the Chiefs
 Are taking counsel together
 About thee, to slay thee:
 So get thee away, for I
 Do give thee sincere advice."

21. He therefore got away therefrom,
 Looking about, in a state
 Of fear. He prayed:
 "O my Lord! save me
 From people given to wrong-doing."

  

SECTION 3.

22. When, when he turned his face
 Towards (the land of) Madyan,
 He said: "I do hope
 That my Lord will show me
 The smooth and straight Path."

23. And when he arrived at
 The watering (place) in Madyan;
 He found there a group
 Of men watering (their flocks),
 And besides them he found
 Two women who were keeping

Back (their flocks). He said:
 "What is the matter with you?"
 They said: "We cannot water
 (Our flocks) until the shepherds
 Take back (their flocks):
 And our father is
 A very old man."

24. So he watered (their flocks)
 For them; then he turned back
 To the shade, and said:
 "O my Lord!
 Truly am I
 In (desperate) need
 Of any good
 That Thou dost send me!"

25. Afterwards one of the (damsels)
 Came (back) to him, walking
 Bashfully. She said: "My father
 Invites thee that he may
 Reward thee for having watered
 (Our flocks) for us." So when
 He came to him and narrated
 The story, he said:

"Fear thou not: (well) hast thou
 Escaped from unjust people."

26. Said one of the (damsels):
 "O my (dear) father! engage
 Him on wages: truly the best
 Of men for thee to employ is
 The (man) who is strong and trusty"...

27. He said: "I intend to wed
 One of these my daughters
 To thee, on, condition that
 Thou serve me for eight years;
 But if thou complete ten years,
 It will be (grace) from thee.
 But I intend not to place
 Thee under a difficulty:

Thou wilt find me,
 Indeed, if God wills,
 One of the righteous."

28. He said: "Be that (the agreement)
 Between me and thee:
 Whichever of the two terms
 I fulfil, let there be
 No ill-will to me.
 Be God a witness
 To what we say."

  

SECTION 4.

29. Now when Moses had fulfilled
 The term, and was travelling
 With his family, he perceived
 A fire in the direction
 Of Mount Tur. He said
 To his family: "Tarry ye;
 I perceive a fire; I hope
 To bring you from there
 Some information, or a burning
 Firebrand, that ye may
 Warm yourselves."

30. But when he came
 To the (Fire), a voice

Was heard from the right bank
 Of the valley, from a tree
 In hallowed ground:
 "O Moses! Verily
 I am God, the Lord
 Of the Worlds...

31. "Now do thou throw thy rod!"
 But when he saw it
 Moving (of its own accord)
 As if it had been a snake,
 He turned back in retreat,
 And retraced not his steps:
 "O Moses!" (it was said),
 "Draw near, and fear not:
 For thou art of those
 Who are secure.

32. "Move thy hand into
 Thy bosom, and it will
 Come forth white without stain
 (Or harm), and draw thy hand
 Close to thy side
 (To guard) against fear.
 Those are the two credentials
 From thy Lord to Pharaoh
 And his Chiefs: for truly
 They are a people
 Rebellious and wicked."

33. He said: "O my Lord!
 I have slain a man

Among them, and I fear
 Lest they slay me.

34. "And my brother Aaron--
 He is more eloquent in speech
 Than I: so send him
 With me as a helper,
 To confirm (and strengthen) me:
 For I fear that they may
 Accuse me of falsehood."

35. He said: "We will certainly
 Strengthen thy arm through
 Thy brother, and invest you both
 With authority, so they
 Shall not be able to
 Touch you: with Our Signs
 Shall ye triumph,--you two
 As well as those
 Who follow you."

36. When Moses came to them
 With Our Clear Signs, they said:
 "This is nothing but sorcery
 Faked up: never did we
 Hear the like among our fathers
 Of old!"

37. Moses said: "My Lord
 Knows best who it is
 That comes with guidance
 From Him and whose End
 Will be best in the Hereafter:
 Certain it is that
 The wrong-doers will not prosper."

38. Pharaoh said: "O Chiefs!
 No god do I know for you
 But myself: therefore,
 O Haman! light me a (kiln
 To bake bricks) out of clay,
 And build me a lofty
 Palace, that I may mount up
 To the god of Moses:
 But as far as I am concerned,
 I think (Moses) is a liar!"

39. And he was arrogant and insolent
 In the land, beyond reason,--
 He and his hosts: they thought
 That they would not have
 To return to Us!"

40. So We seized him
 And his hosts, and We
 Flung them into the sea:
 Now behold what was the End
 Of those who did wrong!

41. And We made them (but)
 Leaders inviting to the Fire;
 And on the Day of Judgment
 No help shall they find.

42. In this world We made
 A Curse to follow them:
 And on the Day of Judgment
 They will be among
 The loathed (and despised).

  

SECTION 5.

43. We did reveal to Moses
 The Book after We had
 Destroyed the earlier generations,
 (To give) Insight to men,
 And Guidance and Mercy,
 That they might receive admonition.

44. Thou wast not on the Western
 Side when We decreed
 The Commission to Moses,
 Nor wast thou a witness
 (Of those events).

45. But We raised up (new)
 Generations, and long were the ages
 That passed over them;
 But thou vast not a dweller
 Among the people of Madyan,
 Rehearsing Our Signs to them;
 But it is We Who send
 Apostles (with inspiration).

46. Nor wast thou at the side
 Of (the Mountain of) Tur
 When We called (to Moses).
 Yet (art thou sent)
 As a Mercy from thy Lord,
 To give warning to a people
 To whom no warner had come
 Before thee: in order that
 They may receive admonition.

47. If (We had) not (sent thee
 To the Quraish),--in case
 A calamity should seize them
 For (the deeds) that their hands
 Have sent forth, they might say:
 "Our Lord! why didst Thou not

Send us an apostle? We
 Should then have followed
 Thy Signs and been amongst
 Those who believe!"

48. But (now), when the Truth
 Has come to them from Ourselves,
 They say, "Why are not
 (Signs) sent to him, like
 Those which were sent to Moses?"
 Do they not then reject
 (The Signs) which were formerly
 Sent to Moses? They say: 
 "Two kinds of sorcery,
 Each assisting the other .
 And they say: "For us,
 We reject all (such things)!"

49. Say: "Then bring ye
 A Book from God,
 Which is a better Guide
 Than either of them,
 That I may follow it!
 (Do), if ye are truthful!"

50. But if they hearken not
 To thee, know that they
 Only follow their own lusts:
 And who is more astray
 Than one who follows his own
 Lusts, devoid of guidance
 From God? For God guides not
 People given to wrong-doing.

  

SECTION 6.

51. Now have We caused
 The Word to reach them
 Themselves, in order that
 They may receive admonition.

52. Those to whom We sent
 The Book before this,--they
 Do believe in this (Revelation);

53. And when it is recited
 To them, they say: "We
 Believe therein, for it is
 The Truth from our Lord:
 Indeed we have been Muslims
 (Bowing to God's Will)
 From before this.

54. Twice will they be given
 Their reward, for that they
 Have persevered, that they avert
 Evil with Good, and that
 They spend (in charity) out of
 What We have given them.

55. And when they hear vain talk,
 They turn away therefrom
 And say: "To us our deeds,
 And to you yours;

Peace be to you: we
 Seek not the ignorant."

56. It is true thou wilt not
 Be able to guide every one;
 Whom thou lowest; but God
 Guides those whom He will.
 And He knows best those
 Who receive guidance.

57. They say: "If we were
 To follow the guidance with thee,
 We should be snatched away
 From our land." Have We not
 Established for them a secure
 Sanctuary, to which are brought
 As tribute fruits of all kinds,--
 A provision from Ourselves?
 But most of them understand not.

58. And how many populations
 We destroyed, which exulted
 In their life (of ease and plenty)!
 Now those habitations of theirs,
 After them, are deserted,--
 All but a (miserable) few!
 And We are their heirs!"

59. Nor was thy Lord the one
 To destroy a population until
 He had sent to its Centre
 An apostle, rehearsing to them
 Our Signs; nor are We
 Going to destroy a population
 Except when its members
 Practise iniquity.

60. The (material) things which
 Ye are given are but
 The conveniences of this life
 And the glitter thereof;
 But that which is with God
 Is better and more enduring:
 Will ye not then be wise?

  

SECTION 7.

61. Are (these two) alike?--
 One to whom We have made
 A goodly promise, and who
 Is going to reach its (fulfilment),
 And one to whom We have
 Given the good things of this
 Life, but who, on the Day
 Of Judgment, is to be among
 Those brought up (for punishment)?

62. That Day (God) will
 Call to them, and say:
 "Where are My 'partners'?--
 Whom ye imagined (to be such)?"

63. Those against whom the charge
 Will be proved, will say:
 "Our Lord! These are the ones
 Whom we led astray:
 We led them astray, as we
 Were astray ourselves: we free
 Ourselves (from them) in Thy presence:
 It was not us they worshipped."

64. It will be said (to them):
 "Call upon your 'partners'
 (For help)": they will call
 Upon them, but they will not
 Listen to them; and they
 Will see the Penalty (before them);
 (How they will wish)
 'If only they had been
 Open to guidance!'

65. That Day (God) will
 Call to them, and say:
 "What was the answer
 Ye gave to the apostles?"

66. Then the (whole) story that day
 Will seem obscure to them
 (Like light to the blind)
 And they will not be able
 (Even) to question each other.

67. But any that (in this life)
 Had repented, believed, and worked
 Righteousness, will have hopes
 To be among those who
 Achieve salvation.

68. Why by Lord does create and choose
 As He pleases: no choice
 Have they (in the matter):
 Glory to God! and far
 Is He above the partners
 They ascribe (to Him)!

69. And thy Lord knows all
 That their hearts conceal
 And all that they reveal.

70. And He is God: there is
 No god. but He. To Him
 Be praise, at the first
 And at the last:
 For Him is the Command,
 And to Him shall ye
 (All) be brought back.

71. Say: See ye? If God
 Were to make the Night

Perpetual over you to the Day
 Of Judgment, what god
 Is there other than God,
 Who can give you enlightenment?
 Will ye not then hearken?

72. Say: See ye? If God
 Were to make the Day
 Perpetual over you to the Day
 Of Judgment, what god
 Is there other than God,
 Who can give you a Night
 In which ye can rest?
 Will ye not then see?

73. It is out of His Mercy
 That He has made for you
 Night and Day,--that ye
 May rest therein, and that
 Ye may seek of His Grace;--
 And in order that ye
 May be grateful.

74. The Day that He will
 Call on them, He will say:
 "Where are My 'partners'?--
 Whom ye imagined (to be such)?"

75. And from each people
 Shall We draw a witness,
 And We shall say: "Produce
 Your Proof": then shall they
 Know that the Truth is in
 God (alone), and the (lies)
 Which they invented will
 Leave them in the lurch.

  

SECTION 8.

76. Qarun was doubtless,
 Of the people of Moses; but
 He acted insolently towards them:
 Such were the treasures We
 Had bestowed on him, that
 Their very keys would
 Have been a burden to
 A body of strong men.
 Behold, his people said to him:
 "Exult not, for God loveth not
 Those who exult (in riches).

77. "But seek, with the (wealth)
 Which God has bestowed on thee,
 The Home of the Hereafter,
 Nor forget thy portion in this

World: but do thou good,
 As God has been good
 To thee, and seek not
 (Occasions for) mischief in the land:
 For God loves not those
 Who do mischief."

78. He said: "This has been given
 To me because of a certain
 Knowledge which I have."
 Did he not know that God
 Had destroyed, before him,
 (Whole) generations,--which were
 Superior to him in strength
 And greater in the amount
 (Of riches) they had collected?
 But the wicked are not
 Called (immediately) to account
 For their sins.

79. So he went forth among
 His people in the (pride
 Of his worldly) glitter.
 Said those whose aim is
 The Life of this World:
 "Oh! that we had the like
 Of what Qarun has got!
 For he is truly a lord
 Of mighty good fortune!"

80. But those who had been granted
 (True) knowledge said: "Alas
 For you! The reward of God
 (In the Hereafter) is best
 For those who believe
 And work righteousness: but this

None shall attain, save those
 Who steadfastly persevere
 (in good)."

81. Then We caused the earth
 To swallow up him and
 His house; and he had not
 (The least little) party
 To help him against God,
 Nor could he defend himself.

82. And those who had envied
 His position the day before
 Began to say on the morrow:
 "Ah! It is indeed God
 Who enlarges the provision"'
 Or restricts it, to any
 Of His servants He pleases!
 Had it not been that God
 Was gracious to us, He
 Could have caused the earth
 To swallow us up! Ah!
 Those who reject God
 Will assuredly never prosper."

  

SECTION 9.

83. What Home of the Hereafter
 We shall give to those
 Who intend not high-handedness
 Or mischief on earth:

And the End is (best)
 For the righteous.

84. If any does good, the reward
 To him is better than
 His deed; but if any
 Does evil, the doers of evil
 Are only punished (to the extent)
 Of their deeds.

85. Verily He Who ordained
 The Qur-an for thee, will bring
 Thee back to the Place
 Of Return. Say: "My Lord
 Knows best who it is
 That brings true guidance,
 And who is in manifest error."

86. And thou hadst not expected
 That the Book would be
 Sent to thee except as
 A Mercy from thy Lord:
 Therefore lend not thou support
 In any way to those

Who reject (God's Message).

87. And let nothing keep thee
 Back from the Signs of God
 After they have been revealed
 To thee: and invite (men)
 To thy Lord, and be not
 Of the company of those
 Who join gods with God.

88. And call not, besides God,
 On another god. There is
 No god but He. Everything
 (That exists) will perish
 Except His own Face
 To Him belongs the Command,
 And to Him will ye
 (All) be brought back.



 

  

Sura XXIX.

  

'Ankabut, or the Spider



1. A. L. M.

2. Do men think that
 They will he left alone
 On saying, "We believe",
 And that they will not
 Be tested?

3. We did test those
 Before them, and God will
 Certainly know those who are
 True from those who are false.

4. Do those who practise
 Evil think that they
 Will get the better of us?
 Evil is their judgment!

5. For those whose hopes are
 in the meeting with God
 (In the Hereafter, let them strive);
 For the Term (appointed)

By God is surely coming:
 And He hears and knows
 (All things).

6. And if any strive (with might
 And main), they do so
 For their own souls:
 For God is free of all
 Needs from all creation.

7. Whose who believe and work
 Righteous deeds,--from them
 Shall We blot out all evil
 (That may be) in them,
 And We shall reward
 Them according to
 The best of their deeds.

8. We have enjoined on man
 Kindness to parents: but if
 They (either of them) strive
 (To force) thee to join
 With Me (in worship)
 Anything of which thou hast
 No knowledge, obey them not.
 Ye have (all) to return
 To Me, and I will
 Tell you (the truth)
 Of all that ye did.

9. And those who believe
 And work righteous deeds,--
 Them shall We admit
 To the company of the Righteous.

10. Then there are among men
 Such as say, "We believe
 In God"; but when they suffer
 Affliction in (the cause of) God,
 They treat men's oppression
 As if it were the Wrath
 Of God! And if help
 Comes (to thee) from thy Lord,
 They are sure to say,'
 "We have (always) been
 With you!" Does not God
 Know best all that is
 In the hearts of all Creation?

11. And God most certainly knows
 Those who believe, and as certainly
 Those who are Hypocrites.

12. And the Unbelievers say
 To those who believe:
 "Follow our path, and we
 Will bear (the consequences)"
 Of your faults." Never
 In the least will they
 Bear their faults: in fact
 They are liars!

13. They will bear their own
 Burdens, and (other) burdens
 Along with their own,
 And on the Day of Judgment.
 They will be called to account
 For their falsehoods.

  

SECTION 2.

14. We (once) sent Noah
 To his people, and he tarried
 Among them a thousand years
 Less fifty: but the Deluge
 Overwhelmed them while they
 (Persisted in) sin.

15. But We saved him
 And the Companions
 Of the Ark, and We made
 The (Ark) a Sign
 For all Peoples!

16. And (We also saved)
 Abraham: behold, he said
 To his people, "Serve God
 And fear Him: that
 Will be best for you
 If ye understand!

17. "For ye do worship idols
 Besides God, and ye invent
 Falsehood. The things that ye
 Worship besides God have
 No power to give you sustenance:

Then seek ye sustenance
 From God, serve Him,
 And be grateful to Him:
 To Him will be your return.

18. "And if ye reject (the Message),
 So did generations before you:
 And the duty of the apostle
 Is only to preach publicly
 (And clearly)."

19. See they not how God
 Originates creation, then
 Repeats it: truly that
 Is easy for God.

20. Say: "Travel through the earth
 And see how God did
 Originate creation; so will
 God produce a later creation:
 For God has power
 Over all things.

21. "He punishes whom He pleases,
 And He grants mercy to whom

He pleases, and towards Him
 Are ye turned.

22. "Not on earth nor in heaven
 Will ye be able (fleeing)
 To frustrate (His Plan),
 Nor have ye, besides God,
 Any protector or helper."

  

SECTION 3.

23. Those who reject the Signs
 Of God and the Meeting
 With Him (in the Hereafter),
 It is they who shall despair
 Of My mercy: it is they
 Who will (suffer)
 A most grievous Penalty.

24. So naught was the answer
 Of (Abraham's) people except
 That they said: "Slay him
 Or burn him." But God
 Did save him from the Fire
 Verily in this are Signs
 For people who believe.

25. And he said: "For you,
 Ye have taken (for worship)
 Idols besides God, out of
 Mutual love and regard

Between yourselves in this life;
 But on the Day of Judgment
 Ye shall disown each other
 And curse each other:
 And your abode will be
 The Fire, and ye shall have
 None to help."

26. But Lut had faith in Him:
 He said: "I will leave
 Home for the sake of
 My Lord: for He is
 Exalted in Might, and Wise."

27. And We gave (Abraham)
 Isaac and Jacob, and ordained
 Among his progeny Prophethood
 And Revelation, and We
 Granted him his reward
 In this life; and he was
 In the Hereafter (of the company)
 Of the Righteous.

28. And (remember) Lut: behold,
 He said to his people:

"Ye do commit lewdness,
 Such as no people in Creation
 (Ever) committed before you.

29. "Do ye indeed approach men,
 And cut off the highway?
 And practise wickedness
 (Even) in your councils?"
 But his people gave no answer
 But this: they said:
 "Bring us the Wrath of God
 If thou tellest the truth."

30. He said: "O my Lord!
 Help Thou me against people
 Who do mischief!"

  

SECTION 4.

31. When Our Messengers came
 To Abraham with the good news,
 They said: "We are indeed
 Going to destroy the people
 Of this township: for truly
 They are (addicted to) crime."

32. He said: "But there is
 Lut there." They said:
 "Well do we know who
 Is there: we will certainly
 Save him and his following,--
 Except his wife: she is
 Of those who lag behind!"

33. And when Our Messengers
 Came to Lut, he was
 Grieved on their account,
 And felt himself powerless
 (To protect) them: but they said:
 "Fear thou not, nor grieve:
 We are (here) to save thee
 And thy following, except
 Thy wife: she is
 Of those who lag behind.

34. "For we are going to
 Bring down on the people
 Of this township a Punishment
 From heaven, because they
 Have been wickedly rebellious."

35. And We have left thereof
 An evident Sign,
 For any people who
 (Care to) understand.

36. To the Madyan (people)
 (We sent) their brother Shu'aib.
 Then he said: "O my people!
 Serve God, and fear the Last
 Day: nor commit evil
 On the earth, with intent
 To do mischief."

37. But they rejected him:
 Then the mighty Blast
 Seized them, and they lay
 Prostrate in their homes
 By the morning.

38. (Remember also) the 'Ad
 And the Thamud (people):
 Clearly will appear to you
 From (the traces) of their buildings
 (Their fate): the Evil One
 Made their deeds alluring
 To them, and kept them hack
 From the Path, though they
 Were gifted with Intelligence
 And Skill.

39. (Remember also) Qarun,
 Pharaoh, and Haman: there came
 To them Moses with Clear Signs,
 But they behaved with insolence
 On the earth; yet they
 Could not overreach (Us).

40. Each one of them We seized
 For his crime: of them,
 Against some We sent
 A violent tornado (with showers
 Of stones); some were caught
 By a (mighty) Blast; some
 We caused the earth
 To swallow up; and some
 We drowned (in the waters):
 It was net God Who
 Injured (or oppressed) them:
 They injured (and oppressed)
 Their own souls.

41. The parable of those who
 Take protectors other than God
 Is that of the Spider,
 Who builds (to itself)

A house; but truly
 The flimsiest of houses
 Is the Spider's house;--
 If they but knew.

42. Verily God doth know
 Of (every thing) whatever
 That they call upon
 Besides Him: and He is
 Exalted (in power), Wise.

43. And such are the Parables
 We set forth for mankind,
 But only those understand them
 Who have Knowledge.

44. God created the heavens
 And the earth in true (proportions):
 Verily in that is a Sign
 For those who believe.

  

SECTION 5.

45. Recite what is sent
 Of the Book by inspiration
 To thee, and establish
 Regular Prayer: for Prayer
 Restrains from shameful
 And unjust deeds;
 And remembrance of God
 Is the greatest (thing in life)
 Without doubt. And God knows
 The (deeds) that ye do.

46. And dispute ye not
 With the People of the Book,
 Except with means better
 (Than mere disputation), unless
 It be with those of them
 Who inflict wrong (and injury):
 But say, "We believe
 In the Revelation which has
 Come down to us and in that
 Which came down to you;

Our God and your God
 Is One; and it is to Him
 We bow (in Islam)."

47. And thus (it is) that We
 Have sent down the Book
 To thee. So the People
 Of the Book believe therein,
 As also do some of these
 (Pagan Arabs): and none
 But Unbelievers reject Our Signs.

48. And thou vast not (able)
 To recite a Book before
 This (Book came), nor art thou
 (Able) to transcribe it
 With thy right hand:
 In that case, indeed, would

The talkers of vanities
 Have doubted.

49. Nay, here are Signs
 Self-evident in the hearts
 Of those endowed with
 knowledge:
 And none but the unjust
 Reject Our Signs.

50. Yet they say: "Why
 Are not Signs sent down
 To him from his Lord?"
 Say: "The Signs are indeed
 With God: and I am
 Indeed a clear Warner.

51. And is it not enough
 For them that We have
 Sent down to thee
 The Book which is rehearsed
 To them? Verily, in it
 Is Mercy and a Reminder
 To those who believe.

  

SECTION 6.

52. Say: "Enough is God
 For a Witness between me

And you: He knows
 What is in the heavens
 And on earth. And it is
 Those who believe in vanities
 And reject God, that
 Will perish (in the end).

53. They ask thee
 To hasten on the Punishment
 (For them): had it not been
 For a term (of respite)
 Appointed, the Punishment
 Would certainly have come
 To them: and it will
 Certainly reach them,--
 Of a sudden, while they
 Perceive not!

54. They ask thee
 To hasten on the Punishment:
 But, of a surety,
 Hell will encompass
 The rejecters of Faith!--

55. On the Day that
 The Punishment shall cover them
 From above them and
 From below them,
 And (a Voice) shall say:
 "Taste ye (the fruits)
 Of your deeds!

56. O My servants who believe!
 Truly, spacious is My Earth:
 Therefore serve ye Me--
 (And Me alone)!

57. Every soul shall have
 A taste of death:
 In the end to Us
 Shall ye be brought back.

58. But those who believe
 And work deeds of righteousness--
 To them shall We give
 A Home in Heaven,--
 Lofty mansions beneath which
 Flow rivers,--to dwell therein
 For aye;--an excellent reward
 For those who do (good)!--

59. Those who persevere in patience,
 And put their trust
 In their Lord and Cherisher.

60. How many are the creatures
 That carry not their own

Sustenance? It is God
 Who feeds (both) them and you:
 For He hears and knows
 (All things).

61. If indeed thou ask them
 Who has created the heavens
 And the earth and subjected
 The sun and the moon
 (To His Law), they will
 Certainly reply, "God".
 How are they then deluded
 Away (from the truth)?

62. God enlarges the sustenance
 (Which He gives) to whichever
 Of His servants He pleases;
 And He (similarly) grants
 By (strict) measure, (as He pleases):
 For God has full knowledge
 Of all things.

63. And if indeed thou ask them
 Who it is that sends down
 Rain from the sky,
 And gives life therewith
 To the earth after its death,
 They will certainly reply,
 "God!" Say, "Praise be
 To God!" But most
 Of them understand not.

  

SECTION 7.

64. What is the life of this world
 But amusement and play?
 But verily the Home
 In the Hereafter,--that is
 Life indeed, if they but knew.

65. Now, if they embark
 On a boat, they call
 On God, making their devotion
 Sincerely (and exclusively) to Him;
 But when He has delivered
 Them safely to (dry) land,
 Behold, they give a share
 (Of their worship to others)!--

66. Disdaining ungratefully Our gifts,
 And giving themselves up
 To (worldly) enjoyment! But soon
 Will they know.

67. Do they not then see
 That We have made
 A Sanctuary secure, and that
 Men are being snatched away
 From all around them?
 Then, do they believe in that

Which is vain, and reject
 The Grace of God?

68. And who does more wrong
 Than he who invents
 A lie against God
 Or rejects the Truth
 When it reaches him?
 Is there not a home
 In Hell for those who
 Reject Faith?

69. And those who strive
 In Our (Cause),--We will
 Certainly guide them
 To Our Paths:
 For verily God
 Is with those
 Who do right.



  

Sura XXX.

  

Rum, or The Roman Empire.



1. A. L. M.

2. The Roman Empire
 Has been defeated--

3. In a land close by;
 But they, (even) after
 (This) defeat of theirs,
 Will soon be victorious--

4. Within a few years.
 With God is the Decision,
 In the Past
 And in the Future:
 On that Day shall
 The Believers rejoice--

5. With the help of God.
 He helps whom He will,
 And He is Exalted in Might,
 Most Merciful.

6. (It is) the promise of God.
 Never does God depart
 From His promise:
 But most men understand not.

7. They know but the outer
 (Things) in the life
 Of this world: but
 Of the End of things
 They are heedless.

8. Do they not reflect
 In their own minds?
 Not but for just ends
 And for a term appointed,
 Did God create the heavens
 And the earth, and all
 Between them: yet are there
 Truly many among men
 Who deny the meeting
 With their Lord
 (At the Resurrection)!

9. Do they not travel
 Through the earth, and see
 What was the End
 Of those before them?
 They were superior to them
 In strength: they tilled
 The soil and populated it
 In greater numbers than these
 Have done: there came to them
 Their apostles with Clear (Signs),
 (Which they rejected, to their
 Own destruction): it was not
 God who wronged them, but
 They wronged their own souls.

10. In the long run
 Evil in the extreme
 Will be the End of those
 Who do evil; for that
 They rejected the Signs
 Of God, and held them up
 To ridicule.

  

SECTION 2.

11. It is God Who begins
 (The process of) creation;
 Then repeats it; then
 Shall ye be brought back
 To Him.

12. On the Day that
 The Hour will be established,
 The guilty will be
 Struck dumb with despair.

13. No intercessor will they have
 Among their "Partners",
 And they will (themselves)
 Reject their "Partners".

14. On the Day that
 The Hour will he established,--
 That Day shall (all men)
 Be sorted out.

15. Then those who have believed
 And worked righteous deeds,
 Shall be made happy
 In a Mead of Delight.

16. And those who have rejected
 Faith and falsely denied
 Our Signs and the meeting
 Of the Hereafter,--such
 Shall be brought forth to
 Punishment.

17. So (give) glory to God,
 When ye reach eventide

And when ye rise
 In the morning;

18. Yea, To Him be praise,
 In the heavens and on earth;
 And in the late afternoon
 And when the day
 Begins to decline.

19. It is He Who brings out
 The living from the dead,
 And brings out the dead
 From the living, and Who
 Gives life to the earth
 After it is dead:
 And thus shall ye be
 Brought out (from the dead).

  

SECTION 3.

20. Among His Signs is this,
 That He created you

From dust; and then,--
 Behold, ye are men
 Scattered (far and wide)!

21. And among His Signs
 Is this, that He created
 For you mates from among
 Yourselves, that ye may
 Dwell in tranquillity with them,
 And He has put love
 And mercy between your (hearts):
 Verily in that are Signs
 For those who reflect.

22. And among His Signs
 Is the creation of the heavens
 And the earth, and the variations
 In your languages
 And your colours: verily
 In that are Signs
 For those who know.

23. And among His Signs
 Is the sleep that ye take
 By night and by day,
 And the quest that ye

(Make for livelihood)
 Out of His Bounty: verily
 In that are Signs
 For those who hearken.

24. And among His Signs,
 He shows you the lightning,
 By way both of fear
 And of hope, and He sends
 Down rain from the sky
 And with it gives life to
 The earth after it is dead:
 Verily in that are Signs
 For those who are wise.

25. And among His Signs is this,
 That heaven and earth
 Stand by His Command:
 Then when He calls you,
 By a single call, from the earth,
 Behold, ye (straightway) come forth.

26. To Him belongs every being
 That is in the heavens
 And on earth: all are
 Devoutly obedient to Him.

27. It is He Who begins
 (The process of) creation;
 Then repeats it; and
 For Him it is most easy.
 To Him belongs the loftiest
 Similitude (we can think of)
 In the heavens and the earth:
 For He is Exalted in Might,
 Full of wisdom.

  

SECTION 4.

28. He does propound
 To you a similitude
 From your own (experience):
 Do ye have partners
 Among those whom your right hands
 Possess, to share as equals
 In the wealth We have

Bestowed on you? Do ye
 Fear them as ye fear
 Each other? Thus do We
 Explain the Signs in detail
 To a people that understand.

29. Nay, the wrong-doers (merely)
 Follow their own lusts,
 Being devoid of knowledge.
 But who will guide those
 Whom God leaves astray?
 To them there will be
 No helpers.

30. So set thou thy face
 Steadily and truly to the Faith:
 (Establish) God's handiwork according
 To the pattern on which
 He has made mankind:
 No change (let there be)
 In the work (wrought)

By God: that is
 The standard Religion
 But most among mankind
 Understand not.

31. Turn ye back in repentance
 To Him, and fear Him:
 Establish regular prayers,
 And be not ye among those
 Who join gods with God,--

32. Those who split up
 Their Religion, and become
 (Mere) Sects,--each party
 Rejoicing in that which
 Is with itself!

33. When trouble touches men,
 They cry to their Lord,
 Turning back to Him
 In repentance: but when
 He gives them a taste
 Of Mercy as from Himself,
 Behold, some of them
 Pay part-worship to
 Other god's besides their Lord,--

34. (As if) to show their ingratitude
 For the (favours) We have
 Bestowed on them! Then enjoy
 (Your brief day); but soon

Will ye know (your folly).

35. Or have We sent down
 Authority to them, which
 Points out to them
 The things to which
 They pay part-worship?

36. When We give men
 A taste of Mercy,
 They exult thereat:
 And when-some evil
 Afflicts them because of
 What their (own) hands
 Have sent forth, behold,
 They are in despair!

37. See they not that God
 Enlarges the provision and
 Restricts it, to whomsoever
 He pleases? Verily in that
 Are Signs for those who believe.

38. So give what is due
 To kindred, the needy,
 And the wayfarer.
 That is best for those

Who seek the Countenance,
 Of God, and it is they
 Who will prosper.

39. That which ye lay out
 For increase through the property
 Of (other) people, will have
 No increase with God:
 But that which ye lay out
 For charity, seeking
 The Countenance of God,
 (Will increase): it is
 These who twill get
 A recompense multiplied.

40. It is God Who has
 Created you: further, He has
 Provided for your sustenance;
 Then He will cause you
 To die; and again He will
 Give you life. Are there
 Any of your (false) "Partners"
 Who can do any single
 One of these things?
 Glory to Him! and High
 Is He above the partners
 They attribute (to Him)!

  

SECTION 5.

41. Mischief has appeared
 On land and sea because
 Of (the meed) that the hands
 Of men have earned,
 That (God) may give them
 A taste of some of their
 Deeds: in order that the
 May turn back (from Evil).

42. Say: "Travel through the earth
 And see what was the End
 Of those before (you):
 Most of them worshipped
 Others besides God."

43. But set thou thy face
 To the right Religion,
 Before there come from God
 The Day which there is

No chance of averting:
 On that Day shall men
 Be divided (in two).

44. Those who reject Faith
 Will suffer from that rejection:
 And those who work righteousness
 Will spread their couch
 (Of repose) for themselves
 (In heaven):

45. That He may reward those
 Who believe and work righteous
 Deeds, out of His Bounty.
 For He loves not those
 Who reject Faith.

46. Among His Signs is this,
 That He sends the Winds,
 As heralds of Glad Tidings,
 Giving you a taste
 Of His (Grace and) Mercy,--
 That the ships may sail
 (Majestically) by His Command
 And that ye may seek

Of His Bounty: in order
 That ye may be grateful.

47. We did indeed send,
 Before thee, apostles
 To their (respective) peoples,
 And they came to them
 With Clear Signs: then,
 To those who transgressed,
 We meted out Retribution:
 And it was due from us
 To aid those who believed.

48. It is God Who sends
 The Winds, and they raise
 The Clouds: then does He
 Spread them in the sky
 As He wills, and break them
 Into fragments, until thou seest
 Rain-drops issue from the midst
 Thereof: then when He has
 Made them reach such
 His servants as He wills,
 Behold, they do rejoice!--

49. Even though, before they received
 (The rain)--just before this--
 They were dumb with despair!

50. Then contemplate (O man!)
 The memorials of God's Mercy!--
 How He gives life
 To the earth after
 Its death: verily the Same
 Will give life to the men

Who are dead: for He
 Has power over all things.

51. And if We (but) send
 A Wind from which
 They see (their tilth)
 Turn yellow,--behold,
 They become, thereafter,
 Ungrateful (Unbelievers)!

52. So verily thou canst not
 Make the dead to hear,
 Nor canst thou make
 The deaf to hear
 The call, when they show
 Their backs and turn away.

53. Nor canst thou lead back
 The blind from their straying:
 Only those wilt thou make
 To hear, who believe
 In Our Signs and submit
 (Their wills in Islam).

  

SECTION 6.

54. It is God Who
 Created you in a state
 Of (helpless) weakness, then
 Gave (you) strength after weakness,

Then, after strength, gave (you)
 Weakness and a hoary head:
 He creates as He wills,
 And it is He Who has
 All knowledge and power.

55. On the Day that
 The Hour (of reckoning)
 Will be established,
 The transgressors will swear
 That they tarried not
 But an hour: thus were
 They used to being deluded!

56. But those endued with knowledge
 And faith will say:
 "Indeed ye did tarry,
 Within God's Decree,
 To the Day of Resurrection,
 And this is the Day
 Of Resurrection: but ye--
 Ye were not aware!"

57. So on that Day no excuse
 Of theirs will
 Avail the Transgressors,
 Nor will they be invited (then)
 To seek grace (by repentance).

58. Verily We have propounded
 For men, in this Qur-an.
 Every kind of Parable:
 But if thou bring to them
 Any Sign, the Unbelievers
 Are sure to say, "Ye
 Do nothing but talk vanities."

59. Thus does God seal up
 The hearts of those
 Who understand not.

60. So patiently persevere: for
 Verily the promise of God
 Is true: nor let those
 Shake thy firmness, who have
 (Themselves) no certainty of faith.



  

Sura XXXI.

  

Luqman (the Wise).



1. A. L. M.

2. These are Verses
 Of the Wise Book,--

3. A Guide and a Mercy
 To the Doers of Good,--

4. Those who establish regular Prayer,
 And give regular Charity,
 And have (in their hearts)
 The assurance of the Hereafter.

5. These are on (true) guidance
 From their Lord; and these
 Are the ones who will prosper.

6. But there are, among men,
 Those who purchase idle tales,'

Without knowledge (or meaning),
 To mislead (men) from the Path
 Of God and throw ridicule
 (On the Path): for such
 There will be a humiliating
 Penalty.

7. When Our Signs are rehearsed
 To such a one, he turns
 Away in arrogance, as if
 He heard them not, as if
 There were deafness in both
 His ears: announce to him
 A grievous Penalty.

8. For those who believe
 And work righteous deeds,
 There will be Gardens
 Of Bliss,--

9. To dwell therein. The promise
 Of God is true: and He
 Is Exalted in power, Wise.

10. He created the heavens
 Without any pillars that ye
 Can see; He set
 On the earth mountains
 Standing firm, lest it
 Should shake with you;
 And He scattered through it
 Beasts of all kinds.
 We send down rain
 From the sky, and produce

On the earth every kind.
 Of noble creature, in pairs.

11. Such is the Creation of God:
 Now show Me what is there
 That others besides Him
 Have created: nay, but
 The Transgressors are
 In manifest error.

  

SECTION 2.

12. We bestowed (in the past)
 Wisdom on Luqman:
 "Show (thy) gratitude to God."
 Any who is (so) grateful
 Does so to the profit
 Of his own soul: but if
 Any is ungrateful, verily
 God is free of all wants,
 Worthy of all praise.

13. Behold, Luqman said
 To his son by way of

Instruction: "O my son!
 Join not in worship
 (Others) with God: for
 False worship is indeed
 The highest wrong-doing."

14. And We have enjoined on man
 (To be good) to his parents:
 In travail upon travail
 Did his mother bear him,
 And in years twain
 Was his weaning: (hear
 The command), "Show gratitude
 To Me and to thy parents:
 To Me is (thy final) Goal.

15. "But if they strive
 To make thee join
 In worship with Me
 Things of which thou hast
 No knowledge, obey them not;
 Yet bear them company
 In this life with justice
 (And consideration), and follow
 The way of those who
 Turn to Me (in love):
 In the End the return
 Of you all is to Me,
 And I will tell you
 The truth (and meaning)
 Of all that ye did."

16. "O my son!" (said Luqman),
 "If there be (but) the weight
 Of a mustard-seed and
 It were (hidden) in a rock,'
 Or (anywhere) in the heavens or
 On earth, God will bring it
 Forth: for God understands'
 The finest mysteries, (and)
 Is well-acquainted (with them).

17. "O my son! establish
 Regular prayer, enjoin what is
 Just, and forbid what is wrong:
 And bear with patient constancy
 Whate'er betide thee; for this
 Is firmness (of purpose)
 In (the conduct of) affairs.

18. "And swell not thy cheek
 (For pride) at men,
 Nor walk in insolence
 Through the earth;
 For God loveth not
 Any arrogant boaster.

19. "And be moderate
 In thy pace, and lower

Thy voice; for the harshest
 Of sounds without doubt
 Is the braying of the ass."

  

SECTION 3.

20. Do ye not see
 That God has subjected
 To your (use) all things
 In the heavens and on earth,
 And has made His bounties
 Flow to you in exceeding
 Measure, (both) seen and unseen?
 Yet there are among men
 Those who dispute about God,
 Without knowledge and without
 Guidance, and without a Book
 To enlighten them!

21. When they are told to follow
 The (Revelation) that God
 Has sent down, they say:
 "Nay, we shall follow
 The ways that we found
 Our fathers (following)."

What! even if it is
 Satan beckoning them
 To the Penalty
 Of the (Blazing) Fire?

22. Whoever submits
 His whole self to God,
 And is a doer of good,
 Has grasped indeed
 The most trustworthy hand-hold
 And with God rests the End
 And Decision of (all) affairs.

23. But if any reject Faith,
 Let not his rejection
 Grieve thee: to Us
 Is their Return, and We
 Shall tell them the truth
 Of their deeds: for God
 Knows well all that is
 In (men's) hearts.

24. We grant them their pleasure
 For a little while
 In the end shall We
 Drive them to
 A chastisement unrelenting.

25. If thou ask them,
 Who it is that created
 The heavens and the earth.
 They will certainly say,

"God". Say: "Praise be to God!"
 But most of them
 Understand not.

26. To God belong all things
 In heaven and earth: verily
 God is He (that is)
 Free of all wants,
 Worthy of all praise.

27. And if all the trees
 On earth were pens
 And the Ocean (were ink),
 With seven Oceans behind it
 To add to its (supply),
 Yet would not the Words
 Of God be exhausted
 (In the writing): for God
 Is Exalted in power,
 Full of Wisdom.

28. And your creation
 Or your resurrection
 Is in no wise but
 As an individual soul:
 For God is He Who
 Hears and sees (all things).

29. Seest thou not that
 God merges Night into Day
 And He merges Day into Night;
 That He has subjected the sun,
 And the moon (to His Law),
 Each running its course
 For a term appointed; and
 That God is well acquainted
 With all that ye do?

30. That is because God is
 The (only) Reality, and because
 Whatever else they invoke
 Besides Him is Falsehood;
 And because God,--He is
 The Most High, Most Great.

  

SECTION 4.

31. Seest thou not that
 The ships sail through
 The Ocean by the grace
 Of God?--that He may
 Show you of His Signs?
 Verily in this are Signs
 For all who constantly persevere
 And give thanks.

32. When a wave covers them
 Like the canopy (of clouds),
 They call to God
 Offering Him sincere devotion.

But when He has delivered them
 Safely to land, there are
 Among them those that halt
 Between (right and wrong).
 But none reject Our Signs
 Except only a perfidious
 Ungrateful (wretch)!

33. O mankind! do your duty
 To your Lord, and fear
 (The coming of) a Day
 When no father can avail
 Aught for his son, nor
 A son avail aught
 For his father.
 Verily, the promise of God
 Is true: let not then
 This present life deceive you,
 Nor let the Chief Deceiver
 Deceive you about God.

34\. Verily the knowledge
 Of the Hour is
 With God (alone).
 It is He Who sends down
 Rain, and He Who knows
 What is in the wombs.

Nor does any one know
 What it is that he will
 Earn on the morrow:
 Nor does any one know
 In what land he is
 To die. Verily with God
 Is full knowledge and He
 Is acquainted (with all things)



  

Sura XXXII

  

Sajda, or Adoration.



1. A. L. M.

2. (This is) the revelation
 Of the Book in which
 There is no doubt,--
 From the Lord of the Worlds.

3. Or do they say,
 "He has forged it"?
 Nay, it is the Truth
 From thy Lord, that thou
 Mayest admonish a people
 To whom no warner
 Has come before thee:
 In order that they
 May receive guidance.

4. It is God Who has
 Created the heavens
 And the earth, and all
 Between them, in six Days,

And is firmly established
 On the Throne (of authority):
 Ye have none, besides Him,
 To protect or intercede (for you):
 Will ye not then
 Receive admonition?

5. He rules (all) affairs
 From the heavens
 To the earth: in the end
 Will (all affairs) go up
 To Him, on a Day,
 The space whereof will be
 (As) a thousand years
 Of your reckoning.

6. Such is He, the Knower
 Of all things, hidden
 And open, the Exalted
 (In power), the Merciful;--

7. He Who has made
 Everything which He has created
 Most Good: He began
 The creation of man
 With (nothing more than) clay,

8. And made his progeny
 From a quintessence
 Of the nature of
 A fluid despised:

9. But He fashioned him
 In due proportion, and breathed
 Into him something of
 His spirit. And He gave
 You (the faculties of) hearing
 And sight and feeling
 (And understanding):
 Little thanks do ye give!

10. And they say: "What!
 When we lie, hidden
 And lost, in the earth,
 Shall we indeed be
 In a Creation renewed?
 Nay, they deny the Meeting
 With their Lord!"

11. Say: "The Angel of Death,
 Put in charge of you,
 Will (duly) take your souls:
 Then shall ye be brought
 Back to your Lord."

  

SECTION 2.

12. If only thou couldst see
 When the guilty ones
 Will bend low their heads
 Before their Lord, (saying:)
 "Our Lord! We have seen
 And we have heard:
 Now then send us back
 (To the world): we will
 Work righteousness: for we
 Do indeed (now) believe."

13. If We had so willed,
 We could certainly have brought
 Every soul its true guidance:
 But the Word from Me
 Will come true, "I will
 Fill Hell with Jinns
 And men all together."

14. "Taste ye then--for ye
 Forgot the Meeting
 Of this Day of yours,
 And We too will
 Forget you--taste ye
 The Penalty of Eternity
 For your (evil) deeds!"

15. Only those believe
 In Our Signs, who, when

They are recited to them,
 Fall down in adoration,
 And celebrate the praises
 Of their Lord, nor are they
 (Ever) puffed up with pride.

16. Their limbs do forsake
 Their beds of sleep, the while
 They call on their Lord,
 In Fear and Hope:
 And they spend (in charity)
 Out of the sustenance which
 We have bestowed on them.

17. Now no person knows
 What delights of the eye
 Are kept hidden (in reserve)
 For them--as a reward
 For their (good) Deeds.

18. Is then the man
 Who believes no better
 Than the man who is
 Rebellious and wicked?
 Not equal are they.

19. For those who believe
 And do righteous deeds,
 Are Gardens as hospitable
 Homes, for their (good) deeds.

20. As to those who are
 Rebellious and wicked, their abode
 Will be the Fire: every time
 They wish to get away
 Therefrom, they will be forced
 Thereinto, and it will be said
 To them: "Taste ye
 The Penalty of the Fire,
 The which ye were wont
 To reject as false."

21. And indeed We will make
 Them taste of the Penalty
 Of this (life) prior to
 The supreme Penalty, in order
 That they may (repent and) return.

22. And who does more wrong
 Than one to whom are recited
 The Signs of his Lord,
 And who then turns away
 Therefrom? Verily from those
 Who transgress We shall exact
 (Due) Retribution.

  

SECTION 3.

23. We did indeed aforetime
 Give the Book to Moses:

Be not then in doubt
 Of its reaching (thee):
 And We made it
 A guide to the Children
 Of Israel.

24. And We appointed, from among
 Them, Leaders, giving guidance
 Under Our command, so long
 As they persevered with patience
 And continued to have faith
 In Our Signs.

25. Verily thy Lord will judge
 Between them on the Day
 Of Judgment, in the matters
 Wherein they differ
 (among themselves)

26. Does it not teach them
 A lesson, how many generations
 We destroyed before them,
 In whose dwellings they
 (Now) go to and fro?
 Verily in that are Signs:
 Do they not then listen?

27. And do they not see
 That We do drive Rain
 To parched soil (bare
 Of herbage), and produce therewith
 Crops, providing food
 For their cattle and themselves?
 Have they not the vision?

28. They say: "When will
 This Decision be, if ye
 Are telling the truth?"

29. Say: "On the Day
 Of Decision, no profit
 Will it he to Unbelievers
 If they (then) believe!
 Nor Will they he granted
 A respite."

30. So turn away from them,
 And wait: they too
 Are waiting.



  

Sura XXXIII.

  

Ahzab, or The Confederates.



1. O Prophet! Fear God,
 And hearken not
 To the Unbelievers
 And the Hypocrites:
 Verily god is full
 Of knowledge and wisdom.

2. But follow that which
 Comes to thee by inspiration
 From thy Lord: for God
 Is well acquainted
 With (all) that ye do.

3. And put thy trust
 In God, and enough is God
 As a Disposer of affairs.

4. God has not made
 For any man two hearts

In his (one) body: nor has
 He made your wives whom
 Ye divorce by Zihar
 Your mothers: nor has He
 Made your adopted sons
 Your sons. Such is (only)
 Your (manner of) speech
 By your mouths. but God
 Tells (you) the Truth, and He
 Shows the (right) Way.

5. Call them by (the names
 Of) their fathers: that is
 Juster in the sight of God.
 But if ye know not
 Their father's (names, call
 Them) your Brothers in faith,
 Or your Maulas.
 But there is no blame
 On you if ye make
 A mistake therein:
 (What counts is)
 The intention of your hearts:
 And god is Oft-Returning,
 Most Merciful.

6. The Prophet is closer
 To the Believers than
 Their own selves,
 And his wives are
 Their mothers. Blood-relations
 Among each other have
 Closer personal ties,
 In the Decree of God.
 Than (the Brotherhood of)
 Believers and Muhajirs:
 Nevertheless do ye
 What is just to your
 Closest friends: such is
 The writing in the Decree
 (Of God).

7. And remember We took
 From the Prophets their
 Covenant:
 As (We did) from thee:
 From Noah, Abraham, Moses,
 And Jesus the son of Mary:
 We took from them
 A solemn Covenant:

8. That (God) may question
 The (Custodians) of Truth concerning
 The Truth they (were charged with):
 And He has prepared
 For the Unbelievers
 A grievous Penalty.

  

SECTION 2.

9. O ye who believe!
 Remember the Grace of God,
 (Bestowed) on you, when
 There came down on you
 Hosts (to overwhelm you):
 But We sent against them

A hurricane and forces
 That ye saw not:
 But God sees (clearly)
 All that ye do.

10. Behold! they came on you
 From above you and from
 Below you, and behold,
 The eyes became dim
 And the hearts gaped
 Up to the throats,
 And ye imagined various
 (Vain) thoughts about God!

11. In that situation
 Were the Believers tried:
 They were shaken as by
 A tremendous shaking.

12. Find behold! The Hypocrites
 And those in whose hearts
 Is a disease (even) say: "God
 And His Apostle promised us
 Nothing but delusions!"

13. Behold! A party among them
 Said: "Ye men of Yathrib!
 Ye cannot stand (the attack)!
 Therefore go back!"
 And a band of them
 Ask for leave of the Prophet,

Saying, "Truly our houses
 Are bare and exposed," though
 They were not exposed:
 They intended nothing but
 To run away.

14. And if an entry had
 Been effected to them
 From the sides of the (City),
 And they had been
 Incited to sedition.
 They would certainly have
 Brought it to pass, with
 None but a brief delay!

15. And yet they had already
 Covenanted with God not to turn
 Their backs, and a covenant
 With God must (surely)
 Be answered for.

16. Say: "Running away will not
 Profit you if ye are
 Running away from death
 Or slaughter; and even if
 (Ye do escape), no more
 Than a brief (respite)
 Will ye be allowed to enjoy!"

17. Say: "Who is it that can
 Screen you from God
 If it be His wish
 To give you Punishment
 Or to give you Mercy?"
 Nor will they find for themselves,
 Besides God, any protector
 Or helper.

18. Verily God knows those
 Among you who keep back
 (Men) and those who say
 To their brethren, "Come along
 To us", but come not
 To the fight except
 For just a little while,

19. Covetous over you
 Then when fear comes,
 Thou wilt see them looking
 To thee, their eyes revolving,
 Like (those of) one over whom
 Hovers death: but when
 The fear is past,
 They will smite you
 With sharp tongues, covetous
 Of goods. Such men have
 No faith, and so God
 Has made their deeds
 Of none effect: and that
 Is easy for God.

20. They think that the Confederates
 Have not withdrawn; and if
 The Confederates should come (again),
 They would wish they were
 In the deserts (wandering)
 Among the Bedouins, and
 Seeking news about you
 (From a safe distance);
 And if they were
 In your midst, they
 Would fight but little.

  

SECTION 3.

21. Ye have indeed
 In the Apostle of God
 A beautiful pattern (of conduct)
 For any one whose hope is
 In God and the Final Day,
 And who engages much
 In the praise of God.

22. When the Believers saw
 The Confederate forces,
 They said: "This is
 What God and His Apostle is
 Had promised us, and God
 And His Apostle told us
 What was true." And it
 Only added to their faith
 And their zeal in obedience.

23. Among the Believers are then
 Who have been true to
 Their Covenant with God:
 Of them some have completed
 Their vow (to the extreme),
 And some (still) wait:
 But they have never changed
 (Their determination) in the least:

24. That God may reward
 The men of Truth for
 Their Truth, and punish
 The Hypocrites if that be

His Will, or turn to them
 In Mercy: for God is
 Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

25. And God turned back
 The Unbelievers for (all)
 Their fury: no advantage
 Did they gain; and enough
 Is God for the Believers
 In their fight. And God
 Is full of Strength, Able
 To enforce His Will.

26. And those of the people
 Of the Book who aided
 Them--God did take them
 Down from their strongholds

And cast terror into
 Their hearts, (so that)
 Some ye slew, and some
 Ye made prisoners,

27. And He made you heirs
 Of their lands, their houses,
 And their goods,
 And of a land which

Ye had not frequented
 (Before). And God has
 Power over all things.

  

SECTION 4.

28. O Prophet! say
 To thy Consorts:
 "If it be that ye desire
 The life of this world,
 And its glitter,--then come!
 I will provide for your

Enjoyment and set you free
 In a handsome manner.

29. But if ye seek God
 And His Apostle, and
 The Home of the Hereafter,
 Verily God has prepared
 For the well-doers amongst you
 A great reward.

30. O Consorts of the Prophet
 If any of you were guilty
 Of evident unseemly conduct,
 The Punishment would be
 Doubled to her, and that
 Is easy for God

31. But any of you that is
 Devout in the service of
 God and His Apostle,
 And works righteousness,--
 To her shall We grant
 Her reward twice: and We
 Have prepared for her
 A generous Sustenance.

32. O Consorts of the Prophet!
 Ye are not like any
 Of the (other) women:
 If ye do fear (God),
 Be not too complaisant
 Of speech, lest one
 In whose heart is
 A disease should be moved
 With desire: but speak ye
 A speech (that is) just.

33. And stay quietly in
 Your houses, and make not
 A dazzling display, like
 That of the former Times
 Of Ignorance; and establish
 Regular Prayer, and give
 Regular Charity; and obey
 God and His Apostle.
 And God only wishes
 To remove all abomination

From you, ye Members
 Of the Family, and to make
 You pure and spotless.

34. And recite what is
 Rehearsed to you in your
 Homes, of the Signs of God
 And His Wisdom:
 For God understands
 The finest mysteries and
 Is well-acquainted (with them).

  

SECTION 5.

35. For Muslim men and women,--
 For believing men and women,
 For devout men and women,
 For true men and women,
 For men and women who are
 Patient and constant, for men
 And women who humble themselves
 For men and women who give
 In charity, for men and women
 Who fast (and deny themselves),
 For men and women who
 Guard their chastity, and
 For men and women who

Engage much in God's praise,--
 For them has God prepared
 Forgiveness and great reward.

36. It is not fitting
 For a Believer, man or woman.
 When a matter has been decided
 By God and His Apostle,
 To have any option
 About their decision:
 If any one disobeys God
 And His Apostle, he is indeed
 On a clearly wrong Path.

37. Behold! thou didst say
 To one who had received
 The grace of God
 And thy favour: "Retain thou
 (In wedlock) thy wife,
 And fear God." But thou
 Didst hide in thy heart
 That which God was about
 To make manifest: thou didst
 Fear the people, but it is

More fitting that thou shouldst
 Fear God. Then when Zaid
 Had dissolved (his marriage)
 With her, with the necessary
 (Formality), We joined her
 In marriage to thee:
 In order that (in future)
 There may be no difficulty
 To the Believers in (the matter
 Of) marriage with the vives
 Of their adopted sons, when
 The latter have dissolved
 With the necessary (formality)
 (Their marriage) with them.
 And God's command must
 Be fulfilled.

38. There can be no difficulty
 To the Prophet in what
 God has indicated to him
 As a duty. It was
 The practice (approved) of God
 Amongst those of old
 That have passed away.
 And the command of God
 Is a decree determined.

39. (It is the practice of those)
 Who preach the Messages
 Of God, and fear Him,
 And fear none but God.

And enough is God
 To call (men) to account.

40. Muhammad is not
 The father of any
 Of your men, but (he is)
 The Apostle of God,
 And the Seal of the Prophets:
 And God has full knowledge
 Of all things.

  

SECTION 6.

41. O ye who believe!
 Celebrate the praises of God,
 And do this often;

42. And glorify Him
 Morning and evening.

43. He it is Who sends
 Blessings on you, as do
 His angels, that He may
 Bring you out from the depths
 Of Darkness into Light:
 And He is Full of Mercy
 To the Believers.

44. Their salutation on the Day
 They meet Him will be
 "Peace!"; and He has
 Prepared for them
 A generous Reward.

45. O Prophet! Truly We
 Have sent thee as

A Witness, a Bearer
 Of Glad Tidings,
 And a Warner,--

46. And as one who invites
 To God's (Grace) by His leave,
 And as a Lamp
 Spreading Light.

47. Then give the glad tidings
 To the Believers, that
 They shall have from God
 A very great Bounty.

48. And obey not (the behests)
 Of the Unbelievers
 And the Hypocrites,
 And heed not their annoyances,
 But put thy trust in God.
 For enough is God
 As a Disposer of affairs.

49. O ye who believe!
 When ye marry believing women,
 And then divorce them
 Before ye have touched them,

No period of 'Iddat
 Have ye to count
 In respect of them:
 So give them a present,
 And set them free
 In a handsome manner.

50. O Prophet! We have
 Made lawful to thee
 Thy wives to whom thou
 Hast paid their dowers;
 And those whom thy
 Right hand possesses out of
 The prisoners of war whom
 God has assigned to thee;
 And daughters of thy paternal
 Uncles and aunts, and daughters
 Of thy maternal uncles
 And aunts, who migrated
 (From Mecca) with thee;
 And any believing woman
 Who dedicates her soul

To the Prophet if the Prophet
 Wishes to wed her;--this
 Only for thee, and not
 For the Believers (at large);
 We know what We have
 Appointed for them as to
 Their wives and the captives
 Whom their right hands
 Possess;--in order that
 There should be no difficulty
 For thee. And God is
 Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

51. Thou mayest defer (the turn
 Of) any of them that thou
 Pleasest, and thou mayest receive
 Any thou pleasest: and there
 Is no blame on thee if
 Thou invite one whose (turn)

Thou hadst set aside.
 This were nigher to
 The cooling of their eyes,
 The prevention of their grief,
 And their satisfaction--
 That of all of them--
 With that which thou
 Hast to give them:
 And God knows (all)
 That is in your hearts:
 And God is All-Knowing,
 Most Forbearing.

52. It is not lawful for thee
 (To marry more) women
 After this, nor to change
 Them for (other) wives,
 Even though their beauty
 Attract thee, except any
 Thy right hand should
 Possess (as handmaidens):
 And God doth watch
 Over all things.

  

SECTION 7.

53. O ye who believe!
 Enter not the Prophet's houses,--
 Until leave is given you,
 For a meal, (and then)
 Not (so early as) to wait
 For its preparation: but when
 Ye are invited, enter;
 And when ye have taken
 Your meal, disperse,
 Without seeking familiar talk.
 Such (behaviour) annoys
 The Prophet: he is ashamed
 To dismiss you, but
 God is not ashamed
 (To tell you) the truth.
 And when ye
 Ask (his ladies)
 For anything ye want,
 Ask them from before
 A screen: that makes
 For greater purity for
 Your hearts and for theirs.
 Nor is it right for you

That ye should annoy
 God's Apostle, or that
 Ye should marry his widows
 After him at any time.
 Truly such a thing is
 In God's sight an enormity.

54. Whether ye reveal anything
 Or conceal it, verily
 God has full knowledge
 Of all things.

55. There is no blame
 (On these ladies if they
 Appear) before their fathers
 Or their sons, their brothers,
 Or their brothers' sons,
 Or their sisters' sons,
 Or their women,
 Or the (slaves) whom
 Their right hands possess.
 And, (ladies), fear God;
 For God is Witness
 To all things.

56. God and His Angels
 Send blessings on the Prophet:

O ye that believe!
 Send ye blessings on him,
 And salute him
 With all respect.

57. Those who annoy
 God and His Apostle--
 God has cursed them
 In this world and
 In the Hereafter,
 And has prepared for them
 A humiliating Punishment.

58. And those who annoy
 Believing men and women
 Undeservedly, bear
 (on themselves)
 A calumny and a glaring sin.

  

SECTION 8.

59. O Prophet! Tell
 Thy wives and daughters,
 And the believing women,
 That they should cast
 Their outer garments over
 Their persons (when abroad):
 That is most convenient,
 That they should be known

(As such) and not molested.
 And God is Oft-Forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

60. Truly, if the Hypocrites,
 And those in whose hearts
 Is a disease, and those who
 Stir up sedition in the City,
 Desist not, We shall certainly
 Stir thee up against them:
 Then will they not be
 Able to stay in it
 As thy neighbours
 For any length of time:

61. They shall have a curse
 On them: wherever they
 Are found, they shall be
 Seized and slain
 (Without mercy).

62. (Such was) the practice
 (Approved) of God among those
 Who lived aforetime:
 No change wilt thou find
 In the practice (approved)
 Of God.

63. Men ask thee concerning
 The Hour: say, "The knowledge
 Thereof is with God (alone)":
 And what will make thee
 Understand?--perchance
 The Hour is nigh!

64. Verily God has cursed
 The Unbelievers and prepared
 For them a Blazing Fire,--

65. To dwell therein for ever:
 No protector will they find,
 Nor helper.

66. The Day that their faces
 Will be turned upside down
 In the Fire, they will say:
 "Woe to us! would that
 We had obeyed God
 And obeyed the Apostle!"

67. And they would say:
 "Our Lord! We obeyed
 Our chiefs and our great ones,
 And they misled us
 As to the (right) path.

68. "Our Lord! Give them
 Double Penalty
 And curse them
 With a very great Curse!"

  

SECTION 9.

69. O ye who believe!
 Be ye not like those
 Who vexed and insulted Moses,
 But God cleared him
 Of the (calumnies) they
 Had uttered: and he
 Was honourable in God's sight.

70. O ye who believe!
 Fear God, and (always) say
 A word directed to the Right:

71. That He may make
 Your conduct whole and sound
 And forgive you your sins:
 He that obeys God
 And His Apostle, has already
 Attained the highest
 Achievement.

72. We did indeed offer
 The Trust to the Heavens

And the Earth
 And the Mountains;
 But they refused
 To undertake it,
 Being afraid thereof:
 But man undertook it;--
 He was indeed unjust
 And foolish;--

73. (With the result (that
 God has to punish
 The Hypocrites, men and women,
 And the Unbelievers, men
 And women, and God turns
 In Mercy to the Believers,
 Men and women: for God
 Is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.



  

Sura XXXIV.

  

Saba, or the City of Saba



1. Praise be to God,
 To Whom belong all things
 In the heavens and on earth:
 To Him be Praise
 In the Hereafter:
 And He is Full of Wisdom,
 Acquainted with all things.

2. He knows all that goes
 Into the earth, and all that
 Comes out thereof; all that
 Comes down from the sky
 And all that ascends thereto
 And He is the Most Merciful,
 The Oft-Forgiving.

3. The Unbelievers say,
 "Never to us will come

The Hour": say, "Nay!
 But most surely,
 By my Lord, it will come
 Upon you;--by Him
 Who knows the unseen,--
 From Whom is not hidden
 The least little atom
 In the Heavens or on earth:
 Nor is there anything less
 Than that, or greater, but
 Is in the Record Perspicuous:

4. That He may reward
 Those who believe and work
 Deeds of righteousness: for such
 Is Forgiveness and a Sustenance
 Most Generous."

5. But those who strive
 Against Our Signs, to frustrate
 Them,--for such will be
 A Penalty,--a Punishment
 Most humiliating.

6. And those to whom
 Knowledge has come see
 That the (Revelation) sent down
 To thee from thy Lord--
 That is the Truth,
 And that it guides

To the Path of the Exalted
 (In Might), Worthy
 Of all praise.

7. The Unbelievers say
 (In ridicule): "Shall we
 Point out to you a man
 That will tell you,
 When ye are all scattered
 To pieces in disintegration,
 That ye shall (then be
 Raised) in a New Creation?

8. "Has he invented a falsehood
 Against God, or has
 A spirit (seized) him?"--
 Nay, it is those who
 Believe not in the Hereafter,
 That are in (real) Penalty,
 And in farthest Error.

9. See they not what is
 Before them and behind them,
 Of the sky and the earth
 If We wished, We could
 Cause the earth to swallow
 Them up, or cause a piece
 Of the sky to fall upon them.
 Verily in this is a Sign
 For every devotee that
 Turns to God (in repentance).

  

SECTION 2.

10. We bestowed Grace aforetime
 On David from Ourselves:
 "O ye Mountains! sing ye
 Back the Praises of God
 With him! and ye birds
 (Also)! And We made
 The iron soft for him;--

11. (Commanding), "Make thou
 Coats of mail, balancing well
 The rings of chain armour,
 And work ye righteousness;
 For be sure I see
 (Clearly) all that ye do."

12. And to Solomon (We
 Made) the Wind (obedient):
 Its early morning (stride)
 Was a month's (journey),
 And its evening (stride)
 Was a month's (journey);
 And We made a Font
 Of molten brass to flow

For him; and there were
 Jinns that worked in front
 Of him, by the leave
 Of his Lord, and if any
 Of them turned aside
 From Our command, We
 Made him taste
 Of the Penalty
 Of the Blazing Fire.

13. They worked for him
 As he desired, (making) Arches,
 Images, Basons
 As large as Reservoirs,
 And (cooking) Cauldrons fixed
 (In their places): "Work ye,
 Sons of David, with thanks!
 But few of My servants
 Are grateful!"

14. Then, when We decreed
 (Solomon's) death, nothing showed them
 His death except a little
 Worm of the earth, which

Kept (slowly) gnawing away
 At his staff: so when he
 Fell down, the Jinns saw
 Plainly that if they had
 Known the unseen, they
 Would not have tarried
 In the humiliating Penalty
 (Of their Task).

15. There was, for Saba,
 Aforetime, a Sign in their
 Home-land--two Gardens
 To the right and to the left.
 "Eat of the Sustenance (provided)
 By your Lord, and be grateful
 To Him: a territory fair and happy,
 And a Lord Oft-Forgiving!

16. But they turned away
 (From God), and We sent
 Against them the flood
 (Released) from the Dams,

And We converted their two
 Garden (rows) into "gardens"
 Producing bitter fruit,
 And tamarisks, and some few
 (Stunted) Lote-trees.

17. That was the Requital
 We gave them because
 They ungratefully rejected Faith:
 And never do We give
 (Such) requital except to such
 As are ungrateful rejecters.

18. Between them and the Cities
 On which We had poured
 Our blessings, We had placed
 Cities in prominent positions,
 And between them We had
 Appointed stages of journey
 In due proportion: "Travel therein,
 Secure, by night and by day."

19. But they said: "Our Lord!
 Place longer distances

Between our journey-stages":
 But they wronged themselves (therein).
 At length We made them
 As a tale (that is told),
 And We dispersed them
 All in scattered fragments.
 Verily in this are Signs
 For every (soul that is)
 Patiently constant and grateful.

20. And on them did Satan
 Prove true his idea,
 And they followed him, all
 But a Party that believed.

21. But he had no authority
 Over them,--except that We
 Might test the man who
 Believes in the Hereafter
 From him who is in doubt
 Concerning it: and thy Lord
 Doth watch over all things.

  

SECTION 3.

22. Say: "Call upon other (gods)
 Whom ye fancy, besides God:
 They have no power,
 Not the weight of an atom,--
 In the heavens or on earth:
 No (sort of) share have they
 Therein, nor is any of them
 A helper to God.

23. "No intercession can avail
 In His Presence, except for those
 For whom He has granted
 Permission. So far (is this
 The case) that, when terror
 Is removed from their hearts
 (At the Day of Judgment, then)
 Will they say, "What is it
 That your Lord commanded?"
 They will say, "That which is
 True and just; and He is
 The Most High, Most Great."

24. Say: "Who gives you
 Sustenance, from the heavens

And the earth?" Say:
 "It is God; and certain it is
 That either we or ye
 Are on right guidance
 Or in manifest error!"

25. Say: "Ye shall not be
 Questioned as to our sins,
 Nor shall we be questioned
 As to what ye do."

26. Say: "Our Lord will gather us
 Together and will in the end
 Decide the matter between us
 (And you) in truth and justice:
 And He is the One to decide,
 The One Who knows all."

27. Say: "Show me those whom
 Ye have joined with Him
 As partners: by no means
 (Can ye). Nay, He is God,
 The Exalted in Power,
 The Wise."

28. We have not sent thee
 But as a universal (Messenger)

To men, giving them
 Glad tidings, and warning them
 (Against sin), but most men
 Understand not.

29. They say: "When will this
 Promise (come to pass)
 If ye are telling the truth?"

30. Say: "The appointment to you
 Is for a Day, which ye
 Cannot put back for an hour
 Nor put forward."

  

SECTION 4.

31. The Unbelievers say:
 "We shall neither believe
 In this scripture nor in (any)
 That (came) before it."
 Couldst thou but see when
 The wrong-doers will be made
 To stand before their Lord,
 Throwing back the word (of blame)

On one another! Those who
 Had been despised will say
 To the arrogant ones:
 "Had it not been for you,
 We should certainly
 Have been believers!"

32. The arrogant ones will say
 To those who had been despised:
 "Was it we who kept you
 Back from Guidance after
 It reached you? Nay, rather,
 It was ye who transgressed.

33. Those who had been despised
 Will say to the arrogant ones:
 "Nay! it was a plot
 (Of yours) by day and by night:
 Behold! ye (constantly) ordered us
 To be ungrateful to God
 And to attribute equals to Him!
 They will declare (their) repentance
 When they see the Penalty:
 We shall put yokes

On the necks of the Unbelievers:
 It would only be a requital
 For their (ill) Deeds.

34. Never did We send
 A Warner to a population,
 But the wealthy ones among them
 Said: "We believe not
 In the (Message) with which
 Ye have been sent."

35. They said: "We have more
 In wealth and in sons
 And we cannot be punished."

36. Say: "Verily my Lord enlarges
 And restricts the Provision
 To whom He pleases, but
 Most men understand not."

  

SECTION 5.

37. It is not your wealth
 Nor your sons, that will
 Bring you nearer to Us
 In degree: but only
 Those who believe and work
 Righteousness--these are
 The ones for whom there is
 A multiplied Reward

For their deeds, while
 Secure they (reside)
 In the dwellings on high!

38. Those who strive against
 Our Signs, to frustrate them,
 Will be given over
 Into Punishment.

39. Say: "Verily my Lord enlarges
 And restricts the Sustenance
 To such of His servants
 As He pleases: and nothing
 Do ye spend in the least
 (In His Cause) but He
 Replaces it: for He is
 The Best of those who
 Grant Sustenance.

40. One Day He will
 Gather them all together,
 And say to the angels,
 "Was it you that these
 Men used to worship?"

41. They will say, "Glory to Thee!
 Our (tie) is with Thee
 As Protector--not with them.
 Nay, but they worshipped

The Jinns: most of them
 Believed in them."

42. So on that Day
 No power shall they have
 Over each other, for profit
 Or harm: and We shall
 Say to the wrong-doers,
 "Taste ye the Penalty's
 Of the Fire,--the which
 Ye were wont to deny!"

43. When Our Clear Signs
 Are rehearsed to them,
 They say, "This is only
 A man who wishes
 To hinder you from the (worship)
 Which your fathers practised."
 And they say, "This is
 Only a falsehood invented!"
 And the Unbelievers say
 Of the Truth when it comes
 To them, "This is nothing
 But evident magic!"

44. But We had not given
 Them Books which they could
 Study, nor sent apostles
 To them before thee
 As Warners.

45. And their predecessors rejected
 (The Truth); these have
 Not received a tenth
 Of what We had granted
 To those: yet when they rejected
 My apostles, how (terrible)
 Was My rejection (of them)!

  

SECTION 6.

46. Say: "I do admonish you
 On one point: that ye
 Do stand up before God,--
 (It may be) in pairs,
 Or (it may be) singly,--
 And reflect (within yourselves):
 Your Companion is not
 Possessed: he is no less
 Than a Warner to you,
 In face of a terrible
 Penalty."

47. Say: "No reward do I
 Ask of you: it is (all)
 In your interest: my reward
 Is only due from God:
 And He is Witness
 To all things."

48. Say: "Verily my Lord
 Doth cast the (mantle

Of) Truth (over His servants),--
 He that has full knowledge
 Of (all) that is hidden."

49. Say: "The Truth has arrived,
 And Falsehood neither creates
 Anything new, nor restores
 Anything."

50. Say: "If I am astray,
 I only stray to the loss
 Of my own soul: but if
 I receive guidance, it is seen
 Because of the inspiration
 Of my Lord to me:
 It is He Who hears
 All things, and is (ever) near."

51. If thou couldst but see
 When they will quake
 With terror; but then
 There will be no escape
 (For them), and they will he
 Seized from a position
 (Quite) near.

52. And they will say,
 "We do believe (now)
 In the (Truth)"; but how
 Could they receive (Faith)
 From a position (so) far off,--

53. Seeing that they did reject
 Faith (entirely) before, and
 That they (continually) cast
 (Slanders) on the Unseen
 From a position far off?

54. And between them
 And their desires,
 Is placed a barrier,
 As was done in the past
 With their partisans:
 For they were indeed
 In suspicious (disquieting) doubt.



  

Sura XXXV.

  

Fatir, or The Originator of Creation; or Malaika, or The Angels.



1. Praise be to God,
 Who created (out of nothing)
 The heavens and the earth,
 Who made the angels
 Messengers with wings,--
 Two, or three, or four (Pairs):
 He adds to Creation
 As He pleases: for God
 Has power over all things.

2. What God out of His Mercy
 Doth bestow on mankind
 There is none can withhold:
 What He doth withhold,

There is none can grant,
 Apart from Him:
 And He is the Exalted
 In Power, Full of Wisdom.

3. O men! call to mind
 The grace of God unto you!
 Is there a Creator, other
 Than God, to give you
 Sustenance from heaven
 Or earth? There is
 No god but He: how
 Then are ye deluded
 Away from the Truth?

4. And if they reject thee,
 So were apostles rejected
 Before thee: to God
 Go back for decision
 All affairs.

5. O men! certainly
 The promise of God
 Is true. Let not then
 This present life deceive you,

Nor let the Chief Deceiver
 Deceive you about God.

6. Verily Satan is an enemy
 To you: so treat him
 As an enemy. He only
 Invites his adherents,
 That they may become
 Companions of the Blazing Fire.

7. For those who reject God,
 Is a terrible Penalty: but
 For those who believe
 And work righteous deeds,
 Is Forgiveness, and
 A magnificent Reward.

  

SECTION 2.

8. Is he, then, to whom
 The evil of his conduct
 Is made alluring, so
 That he looks upon it
 As good, (equal to one
 Who is rightly guided)?
 For God leaves to stray
 Whom He wills, and guides
 Whom He wills. So
 Let not thy soul go out
 In (vainly) sighing after them:
 For God knows well
 All that they do!

9. It is God Who sends
 Forth the Winds, so that

They raise up the Clouds,
 And We drive them
 To a land that is dead,
 And revive the earth therewith
 After its death: even so
 (Will be) the Resurrection!

10. If any do seek
 For glory and power,--
 To God belong
 All glory and power.
 To Him mount up
 (All) Words of Purity:
 It is He Who exalts
 Each Deed of Righteousness.
 Those that lay Plots
 Of Evil,--for them
 Is a Penalty terrible;
 And the plotting of such
 Will be void (of result).

11. And God did create
 You from dust;
 Then from a sperm-drop;
 Then He made you
 In pairs. And no female
 Conceives, or lays down
 (Her load), but with His
 Knowledge. Nor is a man

Long-lived granted length
 Of days, nor is a part
 Cut off from his life,
 But is in a Decree
 (Ordained). All this
 Is easy to God.

12. Nor are the two bodies
 Of flowing water alike,--
 The one palatable, sweet,
 And pleasant to drink,
 And the other, salt
 And bitter. Yet from each
 (Kind of water) do ye
 Eat flesh fresh and tender,
 And ye extract ornaments
 To wear; and thou seest
 The ships therein that plough
 The waves, that ye may
 Seek (thus) of the Bounty
 Of God that ye
 May be grateful.

13. He merges Night into Day,
 And He merges Day

Into Night, and He has
 Subjected the sun and
 The moon (to His Law):
 Each one runs its course
 For a term appointed.
 Such is God your Lord:
 To Him belongs all Dominion.
 And those whom ye invoke
 Besides Him have not
 The least power.

14. If ye invoke them,
 They will not listen
 To your call, and if
 They were to listen,
 They cannot answer
 Your (prayer). On the Day
 Of Judgment they will reject
 Your "Partnership". And none,
 (O man!) can tell thee
 (The Truth) like the One
 Who is acquainted with all things.

  

SECTION 3.

15. O ye men! It is
 Ye that have need

Of God: but God is
 The One Free of all wants,
 Worthy of all praise.

16. If He so pleased, He
 Could blot you out
 And bring in
 A New Creation.

17. Nor is that (at all)
 Difficult for God.

18. Nor can a bearer of burdens
 Bear another's burden.
 If one heavily laden should
 Call another to (bear) his load,
 Not the least portion of it
 Can be carried (by the other),
 Even though he be nearly
 Related. Thou canst but
 Admonish such as fear
 Their Lord unseen
 And establish regular Prayer.
 And whoever purifies himself

Does so for the benefit
 Of his own soul; and
 The destination (of all)
 Is to God.

19. The blind and the seeing
 Are not alike;

20. Nor are the depths
 Of Darkness and the Light;

21. Nor are the (chilly) shade
 And the (genial) heat of the sun:

22. Nor are alike those
 That are living and those
 That are dead. God can
 Make any that He wills
 To hear; but thou
 Canst not make those
 To hear who are
 (Buried) in graves.

23. Thou art no other
 Than a warner.

24. Verily We have sent thee
 In truth, as a bearer
 Of glad tidings,
 And as a warner:

And there never was
 A people, without a warner
 Having lived among them
 (In the past).

25. And if they reject thee,
 So did their predecessors,
 To whom came their apostles
 With Clear Signs, Books
 Of dark prophecies,
 And the Book
 Of Enlightenment.

26. In the end did I
 Punish those who rejected
 Faith: and how (terrible)
 Was My rejection (of them)!

  

SECTION 4.

27. Seest thou not that
 God sends down rain
 From the sky? With it
 We then bring out produce
 Of various colours
 And in the mountains

Are tracts white and red,
 Of various shades of colour,
 And black intense in hue.

28. And so amongst men
 And crawling creatures and cattle,
 Are they of various colours.
 Those truly fear God,
 Among His Servants,
 Who have knowledge:
 For God is Exalted in Might,
 Oft-Forgiving.

29. Those who rehearse the Book
 Of God, establish regular Prayer,
 And spend (in Charity)
 Out of what We have provided
 For them, secretly and openly,
 Hope for a Commerce
 That will never fail:

30. For He will pay them
 Their meed, nay, He will
 Give them (even) more
 Out of His Bounty:
 For He is Oft-Forgiving,
 Most Ready to appreciate (service).

31. That which We have revealed
 To thee of the Book
 Is the Truth,--confirming
 What was (revealed) before it:
 For God is assuredly--
 With respect to His servants--
 Well acquainted and
 Fully Observant.

32. Then We have given
 The Book for inheritance
 To such of Our servants
 As We have chosen:
 But there are among them
 Some who wrong their own

Souls; some who follow
 A middle course; and some
 Who are, by God's leave,
 Foremost in good deeds;
 That is the highest Grace.

33. Gardens of Eternity will they
 Enter: therein will they
 Be adorned with bracelets
 Of gold and pearls;
 And their garments there
 Will be of silk.

34. And they will say:
 "Praise be to God,
 Who has removed from us
 (All) sorrow: for our Lord
 Is indeed Oft-Forgiving
 Ready to appreciate (service):

35. "Who has, out of His Bounty,
 Settled us in a Home
 That will last: no toil
 Nor sense of weariness
 Shall touch us therein."

36. But those who reject (God)--
 For them will be
 The Fire of Hell:
 No term shall be determined

For them, so they should die,
 Nor shall its Penalty
 Be lightened for them.
 Thus do We reward
 Every ungrateful one!

37. Therein will they cry
 Aloud (for assistance):
 "Our Lord! Bring us out:
 We shall work righteousness,
 Not the (deeds) we used
 To do"--"Did We not
 Give you long enough life
 So that he that would
 Should receive admonition?
 And (moreover) the warner
 Came to you. So taste ye
 (The fruits of your deeds):
 For the Wrong-doers
 There is no helper."

  

SECTION 5.

38. Verily God knows
 (All) the hidden things
 Of the heavens and the earth:
 Verily He has full knowledge
 Of all that is
 In (men's) hearts.

39. He it is that has made
 You inheritors in the earth:

If, then, any do reject
 (God), their rejection (works)
 Against themselves: their rejection
 But adds to the odium
 For the Unbelievers
 In the sight of their Lord:
 Their rejection but adds
 To (their own) undoing.

40. Say: "Have ye seen
 (These) "Partners" of yours
 Whom ye call upon
 Besides God? Show me
 What it is they have created
 In the (wide) earth.
 Or have they a share
 In the heavens? Or
 Have We given them a Book
 From which they (can derive)
 Clear (evidence)?--Nay,
 The wrong-doers promise
 Each other nothing but delusions.

41. It is God Who sustains
 The heavens and the earth,
 Lest they cease (to function):
 And if they should fail,
 There is none--not one--
 Can sustain them thereafter:

Verily He is Most Forbearing,
 Oft-Forgiving.

42. They swore their strongest oaths
 By God that if a warner
 Came to them, they would
 Follow his guidance better
 Than any (other) of the Peoples:
 But when a warner came
 To them, it has only
 Increased their flight
 (From righteousness),--

43. On account of their arrogance
 In the land and their
 Plotting of Evil.
 But the plotting of Evil
 Will hem in only
 The authors thereof. Now
 Are they but looking for
 The way the ancients
 Were dealt with? But
 No change wilt thou find
 In God's way (of dealing):
 No turning off wilt thou
 Find in God's way (of dealing).

44. Do they not travel
 Through the earth, and see.
 What was the End
 Of those before them,
 Though they were superior
 To them in strength?
 Nor is God to be frustrated
 By anything whatever
 In the heavens
 Or on earth: for He
 Is All-Knowing, All-Powerful.

45. If God were to punish
 Men according to what
 They deserve, He would not
 Leave on the back
 Of the (earth) a single
 Living creature: but He
 Gives them respite
 For a stated Term:
 When their Term expires,
 Verily God has in His sight
 All His servants.



  

Sura XXXVI.

  

Ya-Sin (being Abbreviated Letters).



1. Ya Sin.

2. By the Qur-an
 Full of Wisdom,--

3. Thou art indeed
 One of the apostles,

4. On a Straight Way.

5. It is a Revelation
 Sent down by (Him),
 The Exalted in Might,
 Most Merciful,

6. In order that thou mayest
 Admonish a people,
 Whose fathers had received
 No admonition, and who
 Therefore remain heedless
 (Of the Signs of God).

7. The Word is proved true
 Against the greater part of them:
 For they do not believe.

8. We have put yokes
 Round their necks
 Right up to their chins,
 So that their heads are
 Forced up (and they cannot see).

9. And We have put
 A bar in front of them
 And a bar behind them,
 And further, We have
 Covered them up; so that
 They cannot see.

10. The same is it to them
 Whether thou admonish them
 Or thou do not admonish
 Them: they will not believe.

11. Thou canst but admonish
 Such a one as follows
 The Message and fears
 The (Lord) Most Gracious, unseen:
 Give such a one, therefore,
 Good tidings, of Forgiveness
 And a reward most generous.

12. Verily We shall give life
 To the dead, and We record
 That which they send before
 And that which they leave
 Behind, and of all things
 Have We taken account

In a clear Book
 (Of evidence).

  

SECTION 2.

13. Set forth to them,
 By way of a parable,
 The (story of) the Companions
 Of the City. Behold,
 There came apostles to it.

14. When We (first) sent
 To them two apostles,
 They rejected them:
 But We strengthened them
 With a third: they said,
 "Truly, we have been sent
 On a mission to you."

15. The (people) said: "Ye are
 Only men like ourselves
 And (God) Most Gracious
 Sends no sort of revelation:
 Ye do nothing but lie."

16. They said: "Our Lord doth
 Know that we have been sent
 On a mission to you:

17. "And our duty is only
 To proclaim the clear Message.

18. The (people) said: "For us,
 We augur an evil omen

From you: if ye desist not,
 We will certainly stone you.
 And a grievous punishment
 Indeed will be inflicted
 On you by us."

19. They said: "Your evil omens
 Are with yourselves:
 (Deem ye this an evil omen).
 If ye are admonished?
 Nay, but ye are a people
 Transgressing all bounds!

20. Then there came running,
 From the farthest part
 Of the City, a man,
 Saying, "O my People!
 Obey the apostles:

21. "Obey those who ask
 No reward of you
 (For themselves), and who have
 Themselves received Guidance

22\. "It would not be reasonable
 In me if I did not
 Serve Him Who created me,
 And to Whom ye shall
 (All) be brought back.

23. "Shall I take (other) gods
 Besides Him? If (God)
 Most Gracious should
 Intend some adversity for me,
 Of no use whatever
 Will be their intercession
 For me, nor can they
 Deliver me.

24."I would indeed,
 If I were to do so,
 Be in manifest Error.

25. "For me, I have faith
 In the Lord of you (all):
 Listen, then, to me!"

26. It was said: "Enter thou
 The Garden." He said:
 "Ah me! Would that
 My People knew (what I know)!--

27. "For that my Lord
 Has granted me Forgiveness
 And has enrolled me
 Among those held in honour!"

28. And We sent not down
 Against his People, after him,
 Any hosts from heaven,
 Nor was it needful
 For Us so to do.

29. It was no more than
 A single mighty Blast,
 And behold! they were (like ashes)
 Quenched and silent.

30. Ah! alas for (My) servants!
 There comes not an apostle
 To them but they mock him!

31. See they not how many
 Generations before them
 We destroyed? Not to them
 Will they return:

32. But each one of them
 All--will be brought
 Before Us (for judgment).

  

SECTION 3.

33. A Sign for them
 Is the earth that is dead:
 We do give it life,
 And produce grain therefrom,
 Of which ye do eat.

34. And We produce therein
 Orchards with date-palms
 And vines, and We cause
 Springs to gush forth therein:

35. That they may enjoy
 The fruits of this (artistry):
 It was not their hands
 That made this:
 Will they not then give thanks?

36. Glory to God, Who created
 In pairs all things that
 The earth produces, as well as
 Their own (human) kind
 And (other) things of which
 They have no knowledge.

37. And a Sign for them
 Is the Night: We withdraw
 Therefrom the Day, and behold
 They are plunged in darkness;

38. And the Sun
 Runs his course
 For a period determined
 For him: that is
 The decree of (Him),
 The Exalted in Might,
 The All-Knowing.

39. And the Moon,
 We have measured for her
 Mansions (to traverse)
 Till she returns
 Like the old (and withered)
 Lower part of a date-stalk.

40. It is not permitted
 To the Sun to catch up
 The Moon, nor can
 The Night outstrip the Day:
 Each (just) swims along (its own) orbit
 (According to Law).

41. And a Sign for them
 Is that We bore
 Their race (through the Flood)
 In the loaded Ark;

42. And We have created
 For them similar (vessels)
 On which they ride.

43. If it were Our Will,
 We could drown them:
 Then would there be
 No helper (to hear
 Their cry), nor could
 They be delivered,

44. Except by way of Mercy
 From Us, and by way
 Of (worldly) convenience
 (To serve them) for a time.

45. When they are told,
 "Fear ye that which is
 Before you and that which
 Will be after you, in order
 That ye may receive Mercy,"
 (They turn back).

46. Not a Sign comes to them
 From among the Signs
 Of their Lord, but they
 Turn away therefrom.

47. And when they are told,
 "Spend ye of (the bounties)
 With which God
 Has provided you," the Unbelievers
 Say to those who believe:
 "Shall we then feed those
 Whom, if God had so willed,
 He would have fed, (Himself)?--

Ye are in nothing
 But manifest error."

48. Further, they say, "When
 Will this promise (come to pass),
 If what ye say is true?"

49. They will not (have
 To) wait for aught
 But a single Blast:
 It will seize them while
 They are yet disputing
 Among themselves!

50. No (chance) will they then
 Have, by will, to dispose
 (Of their affairs), nor
 To return to their own people!

  

SECTION 4.

51. The trumpet shall be
 Sounded, when behold!
 From the sepulchres (men)
 Will rush forth
 To their Lord!

52. They will say: "Ah!
 Woe unto us! Who
 Hath raised us up
 From our beds of repose?"
 (A voice will say:)
 "This is what (God)
 Most Gracious had promised.
 And true was the word
 Of the apostles!"

53. It will be no more
 Than a single Blast,
 When to! they will all
 Be brought up before Us!

54. Then, on that Day,
 Not a soul will be
 Wronged in the least,
 And ye shall but
 Be repaid the meeds
 Of your past Deeds.

55. Verily the Companions
 Of the Garden shall
 That Day have joy
 In all that they do:

56. They and their associates
 Will be in groves
 Of (cool) shade, reclining
 On Thrones (of dignity);

57. (Every) fruit (enjoyment)
 Will be there for them;
 They shall have whatever
 They call for;

58. "Peace!"--a Word
 (Of salutation) from a Lord
 Most Merciful!

59. "And O ye in sin!
 Get ye apart this Day!

60. "Did I not enjoin
 On you, O ye children

Of Adam, that ye
 Should not worship Satan;
 For that he was to you
 An enemy avowed?--

61. "And that ye should
 Worship Me, (for that) this
 Was the Straight Way?

62. "But he did lead astray
 A great multitude of you.
 Did ye not, then, understand?

63. "This is the Hell
 Of which ye were
 (Repeatedly) warned!

64. "Embrace ye the (Fire)
 This Day, for that ye
 (Persistently) rejected (Truth)."

65. That Day shall We set
 A seal on their mouths.
 But their hands will speak
 To Us, and their feet
 Bear witness, to all
 That they did.

66. If it had been Our Will,
 We could surely have
 Blotted out their eyes;
 Then should they have
 Run about groping for the Path,
 But how could they have seen?

67. And if it had been
 Our Will, We could
 Have transformed them
 (To remain) in their places;
 Then should they have been
 Unable to move about,
 Nor could they have returned
 (After error).

  

SECTION 5.

68. If We grant long life
 To any, We cause him
 To be reversed in nature:
 Will they not then understand?

69. We have not instructed
 The (Prophet) in Poetry,
 Nor is it meet for him:
 This is no less than

A Message and a Qur-an
 Making things clear:

70. That it may give admonition
 To any (who are) alive,
 And that the charge
 May be proved against those
 Who reject (Truth).

71. See they not that it is
 We Who have created
 For them--among the things
 Which our hands have fashioned--
 Cattle, which are under
 Their dominion?--

72. And that We have
 Subjected them to their (use)?
 Of them some do carry them
 And some they eat:

73. And they have (other) profits
 From them (besides), and they
 Get (milk) to drink.
 Will they not then
 Be grateful?

74. Yet they take (for worship)
 Gods other than God,

(Hoping) that they might
 Be helped!

75. They have not the power
 To help them: but they
 Will be brought up
 (Before Our Judgment-seat)
 As a troop (to be condemned).

76. Let not their speech, then,
 Grieve thee. Verily We know
 What they hide as well as
 What they disclose.

77. Doth not man see
 That it is We Who
 Created him from sperm?
 Yet behold! he (stands forth)
 As an open adversary!

78. And he makes comparisons
 For Us, and forgets his own
 (Origin and) Creation:
 He says, "Who can give
 Life to (dry) bones
 And decomposed ones (at that)?"

79. Say, "He will give them
 Life Who created them
 For the first time!
 For He is well-versed
 In every kind of creation!

80. "The same Who produces
 For you fire out of
 The green tree, when behold!
 Ye kindle therewith
 (Your own fires)!

81. "Is not He Who created
 The heavens and the earth
 Able to create the like
 Thereof?"--Yea, indeed!
 For he is the Creator Supreme,
 Of skill and knowledge (infinite)!

82. Verily, when He intends
 A thing, His Command is,
 "Be", and it is!

83. So glory to Him
 In Whose hands is
 The dominion of all things:
 And to Him will
 Be all brought back.



  

Sura XXXVII.

  

Saffat, or Those Ranged in Ranks.



1. By those who range
 Themselves in ranks,

2. And so are strong
 In repelling (evil),

3. And thus proclaim
 The Message (of God)!

4. Verily, verily, your God
 Is One!--

5. Lord of the heavens
 And of the earth,

And all between them,
 And Lord of every point
 At the rising of the sun!

6. We have indeed decked
 The lower heaven with beauty
 (In) the stars,--

7. (For beauty) and for guard
 Against all obstinate
 Rebellious evil spirits,

8. (So) they should not strain
 Their ears in the direction
 Of the Exalted Assembly

But be cast away
 From every side,

9. Repulsed, for they are
 Under a perpetual penalty,

10. Except such as snatch away
 Something by stealth, and they
 Are pursued by a flaming
 Fire, of piercing brightness.

11. Just ask their opinion:
 Are they the more difficult
 To create, or the (other) beings
 We have created?
 Them have We created
 Out of a sticky clay!

12. Truly dost thou marvel,
 While they ridicule,

13. And, when they are
 Admonished, pay no heed,--

14. And, when they see
 A Sign, turn it
 To mockery,

15. And say, "This is nothing
 But evident sorcery!

16. "What! when we die,
 And become dust and bones,

Shall we (then) be
 Raised up (again)?

17. "And also our fathers
 Of old?"

18. Say thou: "Yea, and ye shall
 Then be humiliated
 (On account of your evil).

19. Then it will be a single
 (Compelling) cry;
 And behold, they will
 Begin to see!

20. They will say, "Ah!
 Woe to us! this is
 The Day of Judgment!"

21. (A voice will say,)
 "This is the Day
 Of Sorting Out, whose
 Truth ye (once) denied!"

  

SECTION 2.

22. "Bring ye up",
 It shall be said,

"The wrong-doers
 And their wives,
 And the things they worshipped--

23. "Besides God,
 And lead them to the Way
 To the (Fierce) Fire!

24. "But stop them,
 For they must be asked:

25. "What is the matter
 With you that ye
 Help not each other?"

26. Nay, but that day they
 Shall submit (to judgment);

27. And they will turn to
 One another, and question
 One .

28. They will say: "It was ye
 Who used to come to us
 From the right hand
 (Of power and authority)!"

29. They will reply: "Nay, ye
 Yourselves had no Faith!

30. "Nor had we any authority
 Over you. Nay, it was
 Ye who were a people
 In obstinate rebellion!

31. "So now has been proved true,
 Against us, the Word
 Of our Lord that we
 Shall indeed (have to) taste
 (The punishment of our sins).

32. "We led you astray: for truly
 We were ourselves astray."

33. Truly, that Day, they will
 (All) share in the Penalty.

34. Verily that is how We
 Shall deal with Sinners.

35. For they, when they were
 Told that there is
 No god except God, would
 Puff themselves up with Pride,

36. And say: "What! Shall we
 Give up our gods.
 For the sake of
 A Poet possessed?"

37. Nay! he has come
 With the (very) Truth,
 And he confirms (the Message
 Of) the apostles (before him).

38. Ye shall indeed taste
 Of the Grievous Penalty;--

39. But it will be no more
 Than the retribution
 Of (the Evil) that ye
 Have wrought;--

40. But the sincere (and devoted)
 Servants of God,--

41. For them is a Sustenance
 Determined,

42. Fruits (Delights); and they
 (Shall enjoy) honour and dignity,

43. In Gardens of Felicity,

44. Facing each other
 On Thrones (of dignity):

45. Round will be passed
 To them a Cup
 From a clear-flowing fountain,

46. Crystal-white, of a taste
 Delicious to those
 Who drink (thereof),

47. Free from headiness;
 Nor will they suffer
 Intoxication therefrom.

48. And besides them will be
 Chaste women, restraining
 Their glances, with big eyes
 (Of wonder and beauty).

49. As if they were
 (Delicate) eggs closely guarded.

50. When they will turn to
 One another and question
 One another.

51. One of them will start
 The talk and say:
 "I had an intimate
 Companion (on the earth),

52. "Who used to say,
 "What! art thou amongst those
 Who bear witness to
 The truth (of the Message)?

53. "When we die and become
 Dust and bones, shall we
 Indeed receive rewards
 And punishments?"

54. (A voice) said: "Would ye
 Like to look down?"

55. He looked down
 And saw him
 In the midst of the Fire.

56. He said: "By God!
 Thou wast little short
 Of bringing me to perdition!

57. "Had it not been for
 The Grace of my Lord,
 I should certainly have been
 Among those brought (there)!

58. "Is it (the case) that
 We shall not die,

59. "Except our first death,
 And that we
 Shall not be punished?"

60. Verily this is
 The supreme achievement!

61. For the like of this
 Let all strive,
 Who wish to strive.

62. Is that the better entertainment
 Or the Tree of Zaqqum?

63. For We have truly
 Made it (as) a trial
 For the wrong-doers.

64. For it is a tree
 That springs out
 Of the bottom of Hell-fire:

65. The shoots of its fruit-stalks
 Are like the heads
 Of devils:

66. Truly they will eat thereof
 And fill their bellies therewith.

67. Then on top of that
 They will be given
 A mixture made of
 Boiling water.

68. Then shall their return
 Be to the (Blazing) Fire.

69. Truly they found their fathers
 On the wrong Path;

70. So they (too) were rushed
 Down on their footsteps!

71. And truly before them,
 Many of the ancients
 Went astray;--

72. But We sent aforetime,
 Among them, (apostles)
 To admonish them;--

73. Then see what was
 The End of those who
 Were admonished (but heeded not),--

74. Except the sincere (and devoted)
 Servants of God.

  

SECTION 3.

75. (In the days of old),
 Noah cried to Us,
 And We are the Best
 To hear prayer.

76. And We delivered him
 And his people from
 The Great Calamity,

77. And made his progeny
 To endure (on this earth);

78. And We left (this blessing)
 For him among generations
 To come in later times:

79. "Peace and salutation to Noah
 Among the nations!"

80. Thus indeed do We reward
 Those who do right.

81. For he was one
 Of Our believing Servants.

82. Then the rest We overwhelmed
 In the Flood.

83. Verily among those
 Who followed his Way
 Was Abraham.

84. Behold, he approached his Lord
 With a sound heart.

85. Behold, he said to his father
 And to his people, "What
 Is that which ye worship?

86. "Is it a Falsehood--
 Gods other than God--
 That ye desire?

87. "Then what is your idea
 About the Lord of the
 Worlds?"

88. Then did he cast
 A glance at the Stars,

89. And he said, "I am
 Indeed sick (at heart)!"

90. So they turned away
 From him, and departed.

91. When did he turn
 To their gods and said,
 "Will ye not eat
 (Of the offerings before you)?...

92. "What is the matter
 With you that ye
 Speak not (intelligently)?"

93. Then did he turn
 Upon them, striking (them)
 With the right hand.

94. Then came (the worshippers)
 With hurried steps,
 And faced (him).

95. He said: "Worship ye
 That which ye have
 (Yourselves) carved?

96. "But God has created you
 And your handiwork!"

97. They said, "Build him
 A furnace, and throw him
 Into the blazing fire!"

98. (This failing), they then
 Sought a stratagem against him,

But We made them the ones
 Most humiliated!

99. He said: "I will go
 To my Lord! He
 Will surely guide me!

100. "O my Lord! grant me
 A righteous (son)!"

101. So We gave him
 The good news
 Of a boy ready
 To suffer and forbear.

102. Then, when (the son)
 Reached (the age of)
 (Serious) work with him,
 He said: "O my son
 I see in vision
 That I offer thee in sacrifice:
 Now see what is
 Thy view!" (The son) said:
 "O my father! Do
 As thou art commanded:

Thou will find me,
 If God so wills one
 Practising Patience and Constancy!"

103. So when they had both
 Submitted their wills (to God),
 And he had laid him
 Prostrate on his forehead
 (For sacrifice),

104. We called out to him,
 "O Abraham!

105. "Thou hast already fulfilled
 The vision!"--thus indeed
 Do We reward
 Those who do right.

106. For this was obviously
 A trial--

107. And We ransomed him
 With a momentous sacrifice:

108. And We left (this blessing)
 For him among generations
 (To come) in later times:

109. "Peace and salutation
 To Abraham!"

110. Thus indeed do We reward
 Those who do right

111. For he was one
 Of Our believing Servants.

112. And We gave him
 The good news
 Of Isaac--a prophet,--
 One of the Righteous.

113. We blessed him and Isaac:
 But of their progeny
 Are (some) that do right,
 And (some) that obviously
 Do wrong, to their own souls.

  

SECTION 4.

114. Again, (of old,)
 We bestowed Our favour

On Moses and Aaron,

115. And We delivered them
 And their people from
 (Their) Great Calamity;

116. And We helped them,
 So they overcame
 (their troubles);

117. And We gave them
 The Book which helps
 To make things clear;

118. And We guided them
 To the Straight Way.

119. And We left (this blessing)
 For them among generations
 (To come) in later times:

120. "Peace and salutation
 To Moses and Aaron!"

121. Thus indeed do We reward
 Those who do right.

122. For they were two
 Of Our believing Servants.

123. So also was Elias
 Among those sent (by Us).

124. Behold, he said
 To his people,
 "Will ye not fear (God)?

125. "Will ye call upon Baal
 And forsake the Best
 Of Creators,--

126. "God, your Lord and Cherisher
 And the Lord and Cherisher
 Of your fathers of old?"

127. But they rejected him,
 And they will certainly
 Be called up (for punishment),--

128. Except the sincere and devoted
 Servants of God (among them).

129. And We left (this blessing)
 For him among generations
 (To come) in later times:

130. "Peace and salutation
 To such as Elias!"

131. Thus indeed do We reward
 Those who do right.

132. For he was one
 Of Our believing Servants.

133. So also was Lot
 Among those sent (by Us).

134. Behold, We delivered him
 And his adherents, all

135. Except an old woman
 Who was among those
 Who lagged behind:

136. Then We destroyed
 The rest.

137. Verily, ye pass
 By their (sites),
 By day--

138. And by night:
 Will ye not understand?

  

SECTION 5.

139. So also was Jonah
 Among those sent (by Us).

140. When he ran away
 (Like a slave from captivity)
 To the ship (fully) laden,

141. He (agreed to) cast lots,
 And he was condemned:

142. Then the big Fish
 Did swallow him,
 And he had done
 Acts worthy of blame.

143. Had it not been
 That he (repented and)
 Glorified God,

144. He would certainly have
 Remained inside the Fish
 Till the Day of Resurrection.

145. But We cast him forth
 On the naked shore
 In a state of sickness,

146. And We caused to grow,
 Over him, a spreading plant
 Of the Gourd kind.

147. And We sent him
 (On a mission)
 To a hundred thousand
 (Men) or more.

148. And they believed;
 So We permitted them
 To enjoy (their life)
 For a while.

149. Now ask them their opinion:
 Is it that thy Lord
 Has (only) daughters, and they
 Have sons?--

150. Or that We created
 The angels female, and they
 Are witnesses (thereto)?

151. Is it not that they
 Say, from their own invention,

152. "God has begotten children"?
 But they are liars!

153. Did He (then) choose
 Daughters rather than sons?

154. What is the matter
 With you? How judge ye?

155. Will ye not then
 Receive admonition?

156. Or have ye
 An authority manifest?

157. Then bring ye your Book
 (Of authority) if ye be
 Truthful!

158. And they have invented
 A blood-relationship
 Between Him and the Jinns:
 But the Jinns know
 (Quite well) that they
 Have indeed to appear
 (Before His Judgment-seat)!

159. Glory to God! (He is free)
 From the things they ascribe
 (To Him)!

160. Not (so do) the Servants
 Of God, sincere and devoted.

161. For, verily, neither ye
 Nor those ye worship--

162. Can lead (any)
 Into temptation
 Concerning God,

163. Except such as are
 (Themselves) going to
 The blazing Fire!

164. (Those ranged in ranks say):
 "Not one of us but has
 A place appointed;

165. "And we are verily
 Ranged in ranks (for service);

166. "And we are verily those
 Who declare (God's) glory!"

167. And there were those
 Who said,

168. "If only we had had
 Before us a Message
 From those of old,

169. "We should certainly have
 Been Servants of God,
 Sincere (and devoted)!"

170. But (now that the Qur-an
 Has come), they reject it:
 But soon will they know!

171. Already has Our Word
 Been passed before (this)
 To Our Servants sent (by Us),

172. That they would certainly
 Be assisted,

173. And that Our forces,--
 They surely must conquer.

174. So turn thou away
 From them for a little while,

175. And watch them (how
 They fare), and they soon
 Shall see (how thou farest)!

176. Do they wish (indeed)
 To hurry on our Punishment?

177. But when it descends
 Into the open space
 Before them, evil will be
 The morning for those who
 Were warned (and heeded not)!

178. So turn thou away
 From them for a little while,

179. And watch (how they fare)
 And they soon shall see
 (How thou farest)!

180. Glory to thy Lord,
 The Lord of Honour
 And Power! (He is free)
 From what they ascribe
 (To Him)!

181. And Peace on the apostles!

182. And Praise to God,
 The Lord and Cherisher
 Of the Worlds.



  

Sura XXXVIII.

  

Sad (being one of the Abbreviated Letters).



1. Sad:

By the Qur-an,
 Full of Admonition:
 (This is the Truth).

2. But the Unbelievers
 (Are steeped) in Self-glory
 And Separatism.

3. How many generations
 Before them did We destroy?
 In the end they cried
 (For mercy)--when
 There was no longer time
 For being saved!

4. So they wonder
 That a Warner has come

To them from among themselves!
 And the Unbelievers say,
 "This is a sorcerer
 Telling lies!

5. "Has he made the gods
 (All) into one God?
 Truly this is
 A wonderful thing!"

6. And the leaders among them
 Go away (impatiently), (saying),
 "Walk ye away, and remain
 Constant to your gods!
 For this is truly
 A thing designed (against you)!

7. "We never heard (the like)
 Of this among the people
 Of these latter days:
 This is nothing but
 A made-up tale!"

8. "What! Has the Message
 Been sent to him--

(Of all persons) among us?"...
 But they are in doubt
 Concerning My (own) Message!
 Nay, they have not yet
 Tasted My Punishment!

9. Or have they the Treasures
 Of the Mercy of thy Lord,--
 The Exalted in Power,
 The Grantor of Bounties
 Without measure?

10. Or have they the dominion
 Of the heavens and the earth
 And all between? If so,
 Let them mount up
 With the ropes and means
 (To reach that end)!

11. But there--will be
 Put to flight even a host
 Of confederates.

12. Before them (were many
 Who) rejected apostles,--
 The People of Noah,
 And 'Ad, and Pharaoh
 The Lord of Stakes,

13. And Thamud, and the People
 Of Lut, and the Companions
 Of the Wood;--such were
 The Confederates.

14. Not one (of them) but
 Rejected the apostles,
 But My Punishment
 Came justly and inevitably
 (On them).

  

SECTION 2.

15. These (to-day) only wait
 For a single mighty Blast,
 Which (when it comes)
 Will brook no delay.

16. They say: "Our Lord!
 Hasten to us our sentence
 (Even) before the Day
 Of Account!"

17. Have patience at what they
 Say, and remember Our Servant
 David, the man of strength:
 For he ever turned (to God).

18. It was We that made
 The hills declare,
 In unison with him,
 Our Praises, at eventide
 And at break of day,

19. And the birds gathered
 (In assemblies): all with him
 Did turn (to God).

20. We strengthened his kingdom,
 And gave him wisdom
 And sound judgment
 In speech and decision.

21. Has the Story of
 The Disputants reached thee?
 Behold, they climbed over
 The wall of the private chamber;

22. When they entered
 The presence of David,
 And he was terrified
 Of them, they said:
 "Fear not: we are two
 Disputants, one of whom
 Has wronged the other:
 Decide now between us
 With truth, and treat us not
 With unjustice, but guide us
 To the even Path.

23. "This man is my brother:
 He has nine and ninety
 Ewes, and I have (but) one:
 Yet he says, "Commit her
 To my care," and is (moreover)
 Harsh to me in speech."

24. (David) said: "He has
 Undoubtedly wronged thee
 In demanding thy (single) ewe
 To be added to his (flock
 Of) ewes: truly many
 Are the Partners (in business)
 Who wrong each other:
 Not so do those who believe
 And work deeds of righteousness,
 And how few are they?"...
 And David gathered that we
 Had tried him: he asked
 Forgiveness of his Lord,
 Fell down, bowing
 (In prostration), and turned
 (To God in repentance).

25. So We forgave him
 This (lapse): he enjoyed,
 Indeed, a Near Approach to Us,
 And a beautiful Place
 Of (final) Return.

26\. O David! We did indeed
 Make thee a vicegerent
 On earth: so judge thou
 Between men in truth (and justice):
 Nor follow thou the lusts
 (Of thy heart), for they will
 Mislead thee from the Path
 Of God: for those who
 Wander astray from the Path
 Of God, is a Penalty Grievous,
 For that they forget
 The Day of .

  

SECTION 3.

27. Not without purpose did We
 Create heaven and earth
 And all between! That
 Were the thought of Unbelievers!
 But woe to the Unbelievers
 Because of the Fire (of Hell)!

28. Shall We treat those
 Who believe and work deeds
 Of righteousness, the same
 As those who do mischief
 On earth? Shall We treat
 Those who guard against evil,
 The same as those who
 Turn aside from the right?

29. (Here is) a Book which
 We have sent down
 Unto thee, full of blessings,
 That they may meditate
 On its Signs, and that
 Men of understanding may
 Receive admonition.

30. To David We gave
 Solomon (for a son),--
 How excellent in Our service!
 Ever did he turn (to Us)!

31. Behold, there were brought
 Before him, at eventide,
 Coursers of the highest breeding,
 And swift of foot;

32. And he said, "Truly
 Do I love the love
 Of Good, with a view
 To the glory of my Lord,"--
 Until (the sun) was hidden
 In the veil (of Night):

33. "Bring them back to me."
 Then began he to pass
 His hand over (their) legs
 And their necks.

34. And We did try
 Solomon: We placed
 On his throne a body
 (Without life): but he did turn
 (To Us in true devotion):

35. He said, "O my Lord!
 Forgive me, and grant me

A Kingdom which,
 (It may be), suits not
 Another after me:
 For Thou art the Grantor
 Of Bounties (without measure).

36. Then We subjected the Wind
 To his power, to flow
 Gently to his order,
 Whithersoever he willed,--

37. As also the evil ones,
 (Including) every kind
 Of builder and diver,--

38. As also others bound
 Together in fetters.

39. "Such are Our Bounties:
 Whether thou bestow them
 (On others) or withhold them,
 No account will be asked."

40. And he enjoyed, indeed,
 A Near Approach to Us,
 And a beautiful Place
 Of (final) Return.

  

SECTION 4.

41. Commemorate Our Servant Job.

Behold he cried to his Lord:
 "The Evil One has afflicted
 Me with distress and suffering!"

42. (The command was given:)
 "Strike with thy foot:
 Here is (water) wherein
 To wash, coal and refreshing,
 And (water) to drink."

43. And We gave him (back)
 His people, and doubled
 Their number,--as a Grace
 From Ourselves, and a thing
 For commemoration, for all
 Who have Understanding.

44. "And take in thy hand
 A little grass, and strike
 Therewith: and break not
 (Thy oath)." Truly We found
 Him full of patience and constancy.
 How excellent in Our service!
 Ever did he turn (to Us)!

45. And commemorate Our Servants
 Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
 Possessors of Power and Vision.

46. Verily We did choose them
 For a special (purpose)--
 Proclaiming the Message
 Of the Hereafter.

47. They were, in Our sight,
 Truly, of the company
 Of the Elect and the Good.

48. And commemorate Isma'il,
 Elisha, and Zul-Kifl:
 Each of them was
 Of the company of the Good.

49. This is a Message
 (Of admonition): and verily,
 For the Righteous,
 Is a beautiful place
 Of (final) Return,--

50. Gardens of Eternity,
 Whose doors will (ever)
 Be open to them;

51. Therein will they
 Recline (at ease);
 Therein can they
 Call (at pleasure)
 For fruit in abundance,
 And (delicious) drink;

52. And beside them will be
 Chaste women restraining
 Their glances, (companions)
 Of equal age.

53. Such is the Promise
 Made to you
 For the Day of Account!

54. Truly such will be
 Our Bounty (to you);
 It will never fail;--

55. ''Yea, such! But
 For the wrong-doers
 Will be an evil place
 Of (final) Return!--

56. Hell!--they will burn
 Therein,--an evil bed
 (Indeed, to lie on)!--

57. Yea, such!--Then
 Shall they taste it,
 A boiling fluid, and a fluid
 Dark, murky, intensely cold!--

58. And other Penalties
 Of a similar kind,
 To match them!

59. Here is a troop
 Rushing headlong with you!
 No welcome for them!
 Truly, they shall burn
 In the Fire!

60. (The followers shall cry
 To the misleaders:)
 "Nay, ye (too)! No welcome
 For you! It is ye who
 Have brought this upon us!
 Now evil is (this) place
 To stay in!"

61. They will say: "Our Lord!
 Whoever brought this upon us,--
 Add to him a double
 Penalty in the Fire!"

62. And they will say:
 "What has happened to us
 That we see not men
 Whom we used to number
 Among the bad ones?

63. "Did we treat them
 (As such) in ridicule,
 Or have (our) eyes
 Failed to perceive them?"

64. Truly that is just and fitting,--
 The mutual recriminations
 Of the People of the Fire!

  

SECTION 5.

65. Say: "Truly am I
 A Warner: no god
 Is there but the One
 God, Supreme and Irresistible,--

66. "The Lord of the heavens
 And the earth, and all
 Between,--Exalted in Might,
 Able to enforce His Will,
 Forgiving again and again."

67. Say: "That is a Message
 Supreme (above all),--

68. "From which ye
 Do turn away!

69. "No knowledge have I
 Of the Chiefs on high,
 When they discuss
 (Matters) among themselves.

70. "Only this has been revealed
 To me: that I am
 To give warning
 Plainly and publicly."

71. Behold, thy Lord said
 To the angels: "I am
 About to create man
 From clay:

72. "When I have fashioned him
 (In due proportion) and breathed
 Into him of My spirit,
 Fall ye down in obeisance
 Unto him."

73. So the angels prostrated themselves,
 All of them together:

74. Not so Iblis: he
 Was haughty, and became
 One of those who reject Faith.

75. (God) said: "O Iblis!
 What prevents thee from
 Prostrating thyself to one
 Whom I have created
 With My hands?
 Art thou haughty?

Or art thou one
 Of the high (and mighty) ones?"

76. (Iblis) said: "I am better
 Than he: Thou createdst
 Me from fire, and him
 Thou createdst from clay."

77. (God) said: "Then get thee
 Out from here: for thou
 Art rejected, accursed.

78. "And My Curse shall be
 On thee till the Day
 Of Judgment."

79. (Iblis) said: "O my Lord!
 Give me then respite
 Till the Day
 The (dead) are raised."

80. (God) said: "Respite then
 Is granted thee--

81. "Till the Day
 Of the Time Appointed."

82. (Iblis) said: "Then,
 By Thy Power, I will
 Put them all in the wrong,--

83. "Except Thy Servants
 Amongst them, sincere
 And purified (by Thy grace)."

84. (God) said: "Then
 It is just and fitting--
 And I say what is
 Just and fitting--

85. "That I will certainly fill
 Hell with thee
 And those that follow thee,--
 Every one."

86. Say: "No reward do I ask
 Of you for this (Qur-an),
 Nor am I a pretender.

87. "This is no less than
 A Message to (all)
 The Worlds.

88. "And ye shall certainly
 Know the truth of it (all)
 After a while."



  

Sura XXXIX.

  

Zumar, or the Crowds.



1. The revelation
 Of this Book
 Is from God,
 The Exalted in Power,
 Full of Wisdom.

2. Verily it is We Who have
 Revealed the Book to thee
 In Truth: so serve God,
 Offering Him sincere devotion.

3. Is it not to God
 That sincere devotion
 Is due? But those who
 Take for protectors others
 Than God (say): "We only
 Serve them in order that
 They may bring us nearer
 To God." Truly God
 Will judge between them
 In that wherein they differ.
 But God guides not
 Such as are false
 And ungrateful.

4. Had God wished
 To take to Himself
 A son, He could have
 Chosen whom He pleased
 Out of those whom He
 Doth create: but Glory
 Be to Him! (He is above
 Such things.) He is God,
 The One, the Irresistible.

5. He created the heavens
 And the earth
 In true (proportions):
 He makes the Night
 Overlap the Day, and the Day
 Overlap the Night:
 He has subjected
 The sun and the moon
 (To His law):
 Each one follows a course
 For a time appointed.
 Is not He the Exalted
 In Power--He Who forgives
 Again and again?

6. He created you (all)
 From a single Person:
 Then created, of like nature,
 His mate; and He
 Sent down for you eight head
 Of cattle in pairs:
 He makes you,
 In the wombs

Of your mothers,
 In stages, one after another,
 In three veils of darkness.
 Such is God, your Lord
 And Cherisher: to Him belongs
 (All) dominion. There is
 No god but He: then
 How are ye turned away
 (From your true Centre)?

7. If ye reject (God),
 Truly God hath no need
 Of you; but He liketh not
 Ingratitude from His servants:
 If ye are grateful, He
 Is pleased with you.
 No bearer of burdens
 Can bear the burden
 Of another. In the End,
 To your Lord is your Return,
 When He will tell you
 The truth of all
 That ye did (in this life).
 For He knoweth well
 All that is in (men's) hearts.

8. When some trouble toucheth man,
 He crieth unto his Lord,

Turning to Him in repentance:
 But when He bestoweth
 A favour upon him
 As from Himself, (man)
 Doth forget what he cried
 And prayed for before,
 And he doth set up
 Rivals unto God,
 Thus misleading others
 From God's Path.
 Say, "Enjoy thy blasphemy
 For a little while:
 Verily thou art (one)
 Of the Companions of the Fire!"

9. Is one who worships devoutly
 During the hours of the night
 Prostrating himself or standing
 (In adoration), who takes heed
 Of the Hereafter, and who
 Places his hope in the Mercy
 Of his Lord--(like one
 Who does not)? Say:
 "Are those equal, those who know
 And those who do not know?
 It is those who are
 Endued with understanding
 That receive admonition.

  

SECTION 2.

10. Say: "O ye
 My servants who believe!
 Fear your Lord.
 Good is (the reward)
 For those who do good
 In this world.

Spacious is God's earth!
 Those who patiently persevere
 Will truly receive
 A reward without measure!"

11. Say: "Verily, I am commanded
 To serve God
 With sincere devotion;

12. "And I am commanded
 To be the first
 Of those who bow
 To God in Islam."

13. Say: "I would, if I
 Disobeyed my Lord,
 Indeed have fear
 Of the Penalty
 Of a Mighty Day."

14. Say: "It is God I serve,
 With my sincere
 (And exclusive) devotion:

15. "Serve ye what ye will
 Besides Him." Say:
 "Truly, those in loss
 Are those who lose
 Their own souls
 And their People
 On the Day of Judgment:
 Ah! that is indeed
 The (real and) evident Loss!

16. They shall have Layers
 Of Fire above them,
 And Layers (of Fire)
 Below them: with this
 Doth God warn off
 His Servants: "O My Servants!
 Then fear ye Me!"

17. Those who eschew Evil,
 And fall not into
 Its worship,--and turn
 To God (in repentance),--
 For them is Good News:
 So announce the Good News
 To My Servants,--

18. Those who listen
 To the Word,
 And follow
 The best (meaning) in it:
 Those are the ones
 Whom God has guided, and those
 Are the ones endued
 With understanding.

19. Is, then, one against whom
 The decree of Punishment

Is justly due (equal
 To one who eschews evil)?
 Wouldst thou, then, deliver
 One (who is) in the Fire?

20. But it is for those
 Who fear their Lord,
 That lofty mansions,
 One above another,
 Have been built:
 Beneath them flow
 Rivers (of delight): (such is)
 The Promise of God:
 Never doth God fail in
 (His) promise.

21. Seest thou not that God
 Sends down rain from
 The sky, and leads it
 Through springs in the earth.?
 Then He causes to grow,
 Therewith, produce of various
 Colours: then it withers;
 Thou wilt see it grow yellow;
 Then He makes it 
 Dry up and crumble away.
 Truly, in this, is
 A Message of remembrance to
 Men of understanding.

  

SECTION 3.

22. Is one whose heart
 God has opened to Islam,
 So that he has received
 Enlightenment from God,
 (No better than one hard-hearted)?
 Woe to those whose hearts
 Are hardened against celebrating
 The praises of God! They
 Are manifestly wandering
 (In error)!

23. God has revealed
 (From time to time)
 The most beautiful Message
 In the form of a Book,
 Consistent with itself,
 (Yet) repeating (its teaching

In various aspects):
 The skins of those who
 Fear their Lord tremble
 Thereat; then their skins
 And their hearts do soften
 To the celebration of
 God's praises. Such is
 The guidance of God:
 He guides therewith
 Whom He pleases, but such
 As God leaves to stray,
 Can have none to guide.

24. Is, then, one who
 Has to fear the brunt
 Of the Penalty on the Day
 Of Judgment (and receive it)
 On his face, (like one
 Guarded therefrom)? It will

Be said to the wrong-doers:
 "Taste ye (the fruits
 Of) what ye earned!

25. Those before them (also)
 Rejected (revelation), and so
 The Punishment came to them
 From directions they did not
 Perceive.

26. So God gave them
 A taste of humiliation
 In the present life,
 But greater is the Punishment
 Of the Hereafter,
 If they only knew!

27. We have put forth
 For men, in this Qur-an
 Every kind of Parable,
 In order that they
 May receive admonition.

28. (It is) a Qur-an
 In Arabic, without any

Crookedness (therein):
 In order that they
 May guard against Evil.

29. God puts forth a Parable--
 A man belonging to many
 Partners at variance with each other,
 And a man belonging entirely
 To one master: are those two
 Equal in comparison?
 Praise be to God!
 But most of them
 Have no knowledge.

30. Truly thou wilt die
 (One day), and truly they
 (Too) will die (one day).

31. In the End will ye
 (All), on the Day
 Of Judgment, settle your disputes
 In the presence of your Lord.

  

SECTION 4.

32. Who, then, doth more wrong
 Than one who utters
 A lie concerning God,
 And rejects the Truth
 When it comes to him
 Is there not in Hell
 An abode for blasphemers?

33. And he who brings the Truth
 And he who confirms
 (And supports) it--such are
 The men who do right.

34. They shall have all
 That they wish for,
 In the presence of their Lord:
 Such is the reward
 Of those who do good:

35. So that God will
 Turn off from them
 (Even) the worst in their deeds
 And give them their reward
 According to the best
 Of what they have done.

36. Is not God enough
 For His servant? But
 They try to frighten thee
 With other (gods) besides Him!
 For such as God leaves
 To stray, there can be
 No guide.

37. And such as God doth
 Guide there can be
 None to lead astray.
 Is not God Exalted
 In Power, (Able to enforce
 His Will), Lord of Retribution?

38. If indeed thou ask them
 Who it is that created
 The heavens and the earth,
 They would be sure to say.
 "God ". Say: "See ye then?
 The things that ye invoke
 Besides God,--can they,
 If God wills some Penalty
 For me, remove His Penalty?--
 Or if He wills some Grace
 For me, can they keep back

His Grace?" Say: "Sufficient
 Is God for me!
 In Him trust those
 Who put their trust."

39. Say: "O my people!
 Do whatever ye can:
 I will do (my part):
 But soon will ye know--

40. "Who it is to whom
 Comes a Penalty
 Of ignominy, and on whom
 Descends a Penalty that abides."

41. Verily We have revealed
 The Book to thee
 In Truth, for (instructing)
 mankind.
 He, then, that receives guidance
 Benefits his own soul:
 But he that strays
 Injures his own soul.
 Nor art thou set
 Over them to dispose
 Of their affairs.

  

SECTION 5.

42. It is God that takes
 The souls (of men) at death;

And those that die not
 (He takes) during their sleep:
 Those on whom He
 Has passed the decree
 Of death, He keeps back
 (From returning to life),
 But the rest He sends
 (To their bodies)
 For a term appointed.
 Verily in this are Signs
 For those who reflect.

43. What! Do they take
 For intercessors others
 Besides God? Say: "Even if
 They have no power whatever
 And no intelligence?"

44. Say: "To God belongs
 Exclusively (the right

To grant) Intercession:
 To Him belongs the dominion
 Of the heavens and the earth:
 In the End, it is to Him
 That ye shall be
 Brought back."

45. When God, the One and Only,
 Is mentioned, the hearts
 Of those who believe not
 In the Hereafter are filled
 With disgust and horror;
 But when (gods) other than He
 Are mentioned, behold,
 They are filled with joy!

46. Say: "O God!
 Creator of the heavens
 And the earth!
 Knower of all that is
 Hidden and open!
 It is Thou that wilt
 Judge between Thy Servants
 In those matters about which
 They have differed."

47. Even if the wrong-doers
 Had all that there is
 On earth, and as much more,
 (In vain) would they offer it

For ransom from the pain
 Of the Penalty on the Day
 Of Judgment: but something
 Will confront them from God,
 Which they could never
 Have counted upon!

48. For the evils of their Deeds
 Will confront them,
 And they will be (completely)
 Encircled by that which
 They used to mock at!

49. Now, when trouble touches man,
 He cries to Us:
 But when We bestow
 A favour upon him
 As from Ourselves,
 He says, "This has been
 Given to me because of
 A certain knowledge (I have)!"
 Nay, but this is
 But a trial, but most
 Of them understand not!

50. Thus did the (generations)
 Before them say! But
 All that they did
 Was of no profit to them.

51. Nay, the evil results
 Of their deeds overtook them.
 And the wrong-doers
 Of this (generation)
 The evil results of their deeds
 Will soon overtake them (too),

And they will never be
 Able to frustrate (Our Plan)!

52. Know they not that
 God enlarges the provision
 Or restricts it, for any
 He pleases? Verily, in this are
 Signs for those who believe!

  

SECTION 6.

53. Say: "O my Servants who
 Have transgressed against their souls
 Despair not of the Mercy
 Of God: for God forgives
 All sins: for He is
 Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

54. "Turn ye to your Lord
 (In repentance) and bow
 To His (Will), before
 The Penalty comes on you:
 After that ye shall not
 Be helped.

55. "And follow the Best
 Of (the courses) revealed
 To you from your Lord,
 Before the Penalty comes
 On you--of a sudden,
 While ye perceive not!--

56. "Lest the soul should (then)
 Say: "Ah! woe is me!--
 In that I neglected
 (My Duty) towards God,
 And was but among those
 Who mocked!"--

57. "Or (lest) it should say:
 "If only God had guided
 Me, I should certainly
 Have been among the righteous!"--

58. "Or (lest) it should say
 When it (actually) sees
 The Penalty, "If only
 I had another chance,
 I should certainly be
 Among those who do good!"

59. "(The reply will be:) "Nay,
 But there came to thee

My Signs, and thou didst
 Reject them: thou vast
 Haughty, and became one
 Of those who reject Faith!

60. (On the Day of Judgment
 Wilt thou see those
 Who told lies against God;--
 Their faces will be turned
 Black; is there not
 In Hell an abode
 For the Haughty?

61. But God will deliver
 The righteous to their place
 Of salvation: no evil
 Shall touch them,
 Nor shall they grieve.

62. God is the Creator
 Of all things, and He
 Is the Guardian and Disposer
 Of all affairs.

63. To Him belong the keys
 Of the heavens
 And the earth:
 And those who reject
 The Signs of God,--
 It is they who will
 Be in loss.

  

SECTION 7.

64. Say: "Is it
 Some one other than God
 That ye order me
 To worship, O ye
 Ignorant ones?"

65. But it has already
 Been revealed to thee,--
 As it was to those
 Before thee,--"If thou
 Wert to join (gods
 With God), truly fruitless
 Will be thy work (in life),
 And thou wilt surely
 Be in the ranks of those
 Who lose (all spiritual good)".

66. Nay, but worship God,
 And be of those who
 Give thanks.

67. No just estimate
 Have they made of God,
 Such as is due to Him:
 On the Day of Judgment
 The whole of the earth
 Will be but His handful,
 And the heavens will be

Rolled up in His right hand:
 Glory to Him!
 High is He above
 The Partners they attribute
 To Him!

68. The Trumpet will (just)
 Be sounded, when all
 That are in the heavens
 And on earth will swoon,
 Except such as it will
 Please God (to exempt).
 Then will a second one
 Be sounded, when, behold,
 They will be standing
 And looking on!

69. And the Earth will shine
 With the glory of its Lord:
 The Record (of Deeds)
 Will be placed (open);
 The prophets and the witnesses
 Will be brought forward;
 And a just decision
 Pronounced between them;
 And they will not
 Be wronged (in the least).

70. And to every soul will be
 Paid in full (the fruit)

Of its deeds; and (God)
 Knoweth best all that
 They do.

  

SECTION 8.

71. The Unbelievers will be
 Led to Hell in crowd:
 Until, when they arrive there,
 Its gates will be opened.
 And its Keepers will say,
 "Did not apostles come
 To you from among yourselves,
 Rehearsing to you the Signs
 Of your Lord, and warning you
 Of the Meeting of this Day
 Of yours?" The answer
 Will be: "True: but
 The Decree of Punishment
 Has been proved true
 Against the Unbelievers!"

72. (To them) will be said:
 "Enter ye the gates of Hell,
 To dwell therein:
 And evil is (this)
 Abode of the arrogant!"

73. And those who feared
 Their Lord will be led
 To the Garden in crowds:
 Until behold, they arrive there;

Its gates will be opened;
 And its Keepers will say:
 "Peace be upon you!
 Well have ye done!"
 Enter ye here,
 To dwell therein."

74. They will say: "Praise be
 To God, Who has
 Truly fulfilled His promise
 To us, and has given us
 (This) land in heritage:
 We can dwell in the Garden
 As we will: how excellent
 A reward for those
 Who work (righteousness)!"

75. And thou wilt see
 The angels surrounding
 The Throne (Divine)
 On all sides, singing Glory
 And Praise to their Lord.
 The Decision between them
 (At Judgment) will be
 In (perfect) justice,
 And the cry (on all sides)
 Will be, "Praise be to God,
 The Lord of the Worlds!"



  

Sura XL.

  

Mu-min, or The Believer.



1. Ha-Mim.

2. The revelation
 Of this Book
 Is from God,
 Exalted in Power,
 Full of Knowledge,--

3. Who forgiveth Sin,
 Accepteth Repentance,
 Is Strict in Punishment,
 And hath a Long Reach
 (In all things).
 There is no god
 But He: to Him
 Is the Final Goal.

4. None can dispute
 About the Signs of God
 But the Unbelievers.
 Let not, then,
 Their strutting about
 Through the land
 Deceive thee!

5. But (there were people) before them,
 Who denied (the Signs),--
 The People of Noah,
 And the Confederates
 (Of Evil) after them;
 And every People plotted
 Against their prophet,
 To seize him, and disputed
 By means of vanities,
 Therewith to condemn
 The Truth: but it was I
 That seized them!
 And how (terrible)
 Was My Requital!

6. Thus was the Decree
 Of thy Lord proved true
 Against the Unbelievers
 That truly they are
 Companions of the Fire!

7. Those who sustain
 The Throne (of God)
 And those around it
 Sing Glory and Praise
 To their Lord; believe
 In Him; and implore Forgiveness
 For those who believe:
 "Our Lord! Thy Reach

Is over all things,
 In Mercy and Knowledge.
 Forgive, then, those who
 Turn in Repentance, and follow
 Thy Path; and preserve them
 From the Penalty
 Of the Blazing Fire!

8. "And grant, our Lord!
 That they enter
 The Gardens of Eternity,
 Which Thou hast promised
 To them, and to the righteous
 Among their fathers,
 Their wives, and their posterity!
 For Thou art (He),
 The Exalted in Might,
 Full of Wisdom.

9. "And preserve them
 From (all) ills;
 And any whom Thou
 Dost preserve from ills
 That Day,--on them
 Wilt Thou have bestowed
 Mercy indeed: and that
 Will be truly (for them)
 The highest Achievement".

  

SECTION 2.

10. The Unbelievers will be
 Addressed: "Greater was
 The aversion of God to you
 Than (is), your aversion

To yourselves, seeing that ye
 Were called to the Faith
 And ye used to refuse."

11. They will say: "Our Lord!
 Twice hast Thou made us
 Without life, and twice
 Hast Thou given us Life!
 Now have we recognised
 Our sins: is there
 Any way out (of this)?"

12. (The answer will be:)
 "This is because, when
 God was invoked as
 The Only (object of worship),
 Ye did reject Faith,
 But when partners were
 Joined to Him, ye believed!
 The Command is with God,
 Most High, Most Great!"

13. He it is Who showeth
 You His Signs, and sendeth
 Down Sustenance for you
 From the sky: but only
 Those receive admonition
 Who turn (to God).

14. Call ye, then, upon God
 With sincere devotion to Him,

Even though the Unbelievers
 May detest it.

15. Raised high above ranks
 (Or degrees),
 (He is) the Lord
 Of the Throne (of authority):
 By His Command doth He
 Send the spirit (of inspiration)
 To any of His servants
 He pleases, that it may
 Warn (men) of the Day
 Of Mutual Meeting,--

16. The Day whereon
 They will (all) come forth:
 Not a single thing
 Concerning them is hidden
 From God. Whose will be
 The Dominion that Day?
 That of God, the One,
 The Irresistible!

17. That Day will every soul
 Be requited for what
 It earned; no injustice
 Will there be that Day,
 For God is Swift
 In taking account.

18. Warn them of the Day
 That is (ever) drawing near,
 When the Hearts will
 (Come) right up to the Throats
 To choke (them);
 No intimate friend
 Nor intercessor will the
 wrong-doers
 Have, who could be
 Listened to.

19. (God) knows of (the tricks)
 That deceive with the eyes,
 And all that the hearts
 (Of men) conceal.

20. And God will judge
 With (Justice and) Truth:
 But those whom (men)
 Invoke besides Him, will
 Not (be in a position)
 To judge at all.
 Verily it is God (alone)
 Who hears and sees
 (All things).

  

SECTION 3.

21. Do they not travel
 Through the earth and see
 What was the End
 Of those before them
 They were even superior
 To them in strength,
 And in the traces (they
 Have left) in the land:
 But God did call them
 To account for their sins,
 And none had they
 To defend them against God.

22. That was because there came
 To them their apostles
 With Clear (Signs),
 But they rejected them:
 So God called them
 To account: for He is
 Full of Strength,
 Strict in Punishment.

23. Of old We sent Moses,
 With Our Signs
 And an Authority manifest,

24. To Pharaoh, Haman,
 And Qarun; but they
 Called (him) "a sorcerer
 Telling lies!"...

25. Now, when he came to them
 In Truth, from Us,
 They said, "Slay the sons
 Of those who believe a
 With him, and keep alive
 Their females," but the plots
 Of Unbelievers (end) in nothing
 But errors (and delusions)!...

26. Said Pharaoh: "Leave me
 To slay Moses; and let him
 Call on his Lord!
 What I fear is lest
 He should change your religion,
 Or lest he should cause
 Mischief to appear
 In the land!"

27. Moses said: "I have indeed
 Called upon my Lord
 And your Lord
 (For protection) from every
 Arrogant one who believes not
 In the Day of Account!"

  

SECTION 4.

28. A Believer, a man
 From among the people
 Of Pharaoh, who had concealed
 His faith, said: "Will ye
 Slay a man because he
 Says, "My Lord is God"?--
 When he has indeed come
 To you with Clear (Signs)
 From your Lord? And if
 He be a liar, on him
 Is (the sin of) his lie;
 But, if he is telling
 The Truth, then will
 Fall on you something
 Of the (calamity) of which
 He warns you: truly
 God guides not one
 Who transgresses and lies!

29. "O my People! yours
 Is the dominion this day:

Ye have the upper hand
 In the land: but who
 Will help us from
 The Punishment of God,
 Should it befall us?"
 Pharaoh said: "I but
 Point out to you that
 Which I see (myself);
 Nor do I guide you
 But to the Path of Right!"

30. Then said the man
 Who believed: "O my People!
 Truly I do fear 
 For you something like
 The Day (of disaster)
 Of the Confederates (in sin)!--

31. "Something like the fate
 Of the People of Noah,
 The 'Ad, and the Thamud,
 And those who came
 After them: but God
 Never wishes injustice
 To His Servants.

32. "And O my People!
 I fear for you a Day
 When there will be
 Mutual calling (and wailing),--

33. "A Day when ye
 Shall turn your backs
 And flee: no defender
 Shall ye have from God:
 Any whom God leaves
 To stray, there is none
 To guide...

34. "And to you there came
 Joseph in times gone by,
 With Clear Signs, but
 Ye ceased not to doubt
 Of the (mission) for which
 He had come: at length,
 When he died, ye said:
 "No apostle will God send
 After him." Thus doth God
 Leave to stray such as
 Transgress and live in doubt,--

35. "(Such) as dispute about
 The Signs of God,
 Without any authority
 That hath reached them.
 Grievous and odious
 (Is such conduct)
 In the sight of God
 And of the Believers.
 Thus doth God seal up
 Every heart--of arrogant
 And obstinate transgressors."

36. Pharaoh said: "O Haman!
 Build me a lofty palace,
 That I may attain
 The ways and means--

37. "The ways and means
 Of (reaching) the heavens,
 And that I may mount up
 To the God of Moses:
 But as far as I am concerned,
 I think (Moses) is a liar!"
 Thus was made alluring,
 In Pharaoh's eyes,
 The evil of his deeds,
 And he was hindered
 From the Path; and the plot
 Of Pharaoh led to nothing
 But perdition (for him).

  

SECTION 5.

38. The man who believed said
 Further: "O my People!
 Follow me: I will lead
 You to the Path of Right.

39. "O my People! This life
 Of the present is nothing
 But (temporary) convenience:
 It is the Hereafter

That is the Home
 That will last.

40. "He that works evil
 Will not be requited
 But by the like thereof:
 And he that works
 A righteous deed--whether
 Man or woman--and is
 A Believer--such will enter
 The Garden (of Bliss): therein
 Will they have abundance
 Without measure.

41. "And O my People!
 How (strange) it is
 For me to call you
 To Salvation while ye
 Call me to the Fire!

42. "Ye do call upon me
 To blaspheme against God,
 And to join with Him
 Partners of whom I have
 No knowledge; and I
 Call you to the Exalted
 In Power, Who forgives
 Again and again!"

43. "Without doubt ye do call
 Me to one who is not
 Fit to be called to,
 Whether in this world,

Or in the Hereafter;
 Our Return will be
 To God; and the Transgressors
 Will be Companions
 Of the Fire!

44. "Soon will ye remember
 What I say to you (now).
 My (own) affair I commit
 To God: for God (ever)
 Watches over His Servants."

45. Then God saved him
 From (every) ill that they
 Plotted (against him),
 But the brunt of the Penalty
 Encompassed on all sides
 The People of Pharaoh.

46. In front of the Fire
 Will they be brought,
 Morning and evening:
 And (the Sentence will be)
 On the Day that
 Judgment will be established:
 "Cast ye the People
 Of Pharaoh into
 The severest Penalty!"

47. Behold, they will dispute
 With each other in the Fire!
 The weak ones (who followed)
 Will say to those who
 Had been arrogant, "We but
 Followed you: can ye then

Take (on yourselves) from us
 Some share of the Fire?"

48. Those who had been arrogant
 Will say: "We are all
 In this (Fire)! Truly,
 God has judged
 Between (His) Servants!"

49. Those in the Fire will say
 To the Keepers of Hell:
 "Pray to your Lord
 To lighten us the Penalty
 For a Day (at least)!"

50. They will say: "Did there
 Not come to you
 Your apostles with Clear Signs?"
 They will say, "Yes".
 They will reply, "Then
 Pray (as ye like)! But
 The Prayer of those
 Without Faith is nothing
 But (futile wandering)
 In (mazes of) error!"

  

SECTION 6.

51. We will, without doubt,
 Help Our apostles and those
 Who believe, (both)
 In this world's life
 And on the Day
 When the Witnesses
 Will stand forth,--

52. The Day when no profit
 Will it be to Wrong-doers
 To present their excuses,
 But they will (only) have
 The Curse and the Home
 Of Misery.

53. We did aforetime give Moses
 The (Book of) Guidance,
 And We gave the Book
 In inheritance to the Children
 Of Israel,--

54. A Guide and a Message
 To men of understanding.

55. Patiently, then, persevere:
 For the Promise of God
 Is true: and ask forgiveness
 For thy fault, and celebrate

The Praises of thy Lord
 In the evening
 And in the morning.

56. Those who dispute
 About the Signs of God
 Without any authority
 Bestowed on them,--there is
 Nothing in their breasts
 But (the quest of) greatness,
 Which they shall never
 Attain to: seek refuge,
 Then, in God: it is He
 Who hears and sees (all things).

57. Assuredly the creation
 Of the heavens
 And the earth
 Is a greater (matter)
 Than the creation of men:
 Yet most men understand not.

58. Not equal are the blind
 And those who (clearly) see:
 Nor are (equal) those
 Who believe and work
 Deeds of righteousness, and
 Those who do evil.
 Little do ye learn
 By admonition!

59. The Hour will certainly come:
 Therein is no doubt:
 Yet most men believe not.

60. And your Lord says:
 "Call on Me; I
 Will answer your (Prayer):
 But those who are
 Too arrogant to serve Me
 Will surely find themselves
 In Hell--in humiliation!"

  

SECTION 7.

61. It is God Who has
 Made the Night for you,
 That ye may rest therein,
 And the Day, as that
 Which helps (you) to see.
 Verily God is Full of
 Grace and Bounty to men:
 Yet most men give
 No thanks.

62. Such is God, your Lord,
 The Creator of all things.
 There is no god but He:
 Then how ye are delude
 Away from the Truth!

63. Thus are deluded those
 Who are wont to reject
 The Signs of God.

64. It is God Who has
 Made for you the earth

As a resting place,
 And the sky as a canopy,
 And has given you shape--
 And made your shapes
 Beautiful,--and has provided
 For you Sustenance,
 Of things pure and good;--
 Such is God your Lord.
 So Glory to God,
 The Lord of the Worlds!

65. He is the Living (One):
 There is no god but He:
 Call upon Him, giving Him
 Sincere devotion. Praise he
 To God, Lord of the Worlds!

66. Say: "I have been forbidden
 To invoke those whom ye
 Invoke besides God,--seeing that
 The Clear Signs have come
 To me from my Lord;
 And I have been commanded
 To bow (in Islam)
 To the Lord of the Worlds."

67. It is He Who has
 Created you from dust,

Then from a sperm-drop,
 Then from a leech-like clot;
 Then does He get you
 Out (into the light)
 As a child: then lets you
 (Grow and) reach your age
 Of full strength; then
 Lets you become old,--
 Though of you there are
 Some who die before;--
 And lets you reach
 A Term appointed;
 In order that ye
 May learn wisdom.

68. It is He Who gives Life
 And Death; and when He
 Decides upon an affair,
 He says to it, "Be",
 And it is.

  

SECTION 8.

69. Seest thou not those
 That dispute concerning
 The Signs of God?
 How are they turned away
 (From Reality)?--

70. Those who reject the Book
 And the (revelations) with which
 We sent Our apostles:
 But soon shall they know,--

71. When the yokes (shall be)
 Round their necks,
 And the chains;
 They shall be dragged along--

72. In the boiling fetid fluid
 Then in the Fire
 Shall they be burned;

73. Then shall it be said
 To them: "Where are
 The (deities) to which
 Ye gave part-worship--

74. "In derogation of God?"
 They will reply: "They have
 Left us in the lurch:
 Nay, we invoked not,
 Of old, anything (that had
 Real existence)." Thus
 Does God leave
 The Unbelievers to stray.

75. "That was because
 Ye were wont to rejoice
 On the earth in things
 Other than the Truth,
 And that ye were wont
 To be insolent.

76. "Enter ye the gates
 Of Hell, to dwell therein:
 And evil is (this) abode
 Of the arrogant!"

77. So persevere in patience;
 For the Promise of God
 Is true: and whether
 We show thee (in this life)
 Some part of what We
 Promise them,--or We
 Take thy soul (to Our Mercy)
 (Before that),--(in any case)
 It is to Us that
 They shall (all) return.

78. We did aforetime send
 Apostles before thee: of them
 There are some whose story
 We have related to thee,
 And some whose story
 We have not related
 To thee. It was not
 (Possible) for any apostle
 To bring a Sign except
 By the leave of God:
 But when the Command
 Of God issued,
 The matter was decided
 In truth and justice,
 And there perished,
 There and then, those
 Who stood on Falsehoods.

  

SECTION 9.

79. It is God who made
 Cattle for you, that ye

May use some for riding
 And some for food;

80. And there are (other) advantages
 In them for you (besides);
 That ye may through them
 Attain to any need
 (There may be) in your hearts;
 And on them and on ships
 Ye are carried.

81. And He shows you (always)
 His Signs: then which
 Of the Signs of God
 Will ye deny?

82. Do they not travel through
 The earth and see what
 Was the End of those
 Before them? They were
 More numerous than these
 And superior in strength
 And in the traces
 (They have left) in the land:
 Yet all that they accomplished
 Was of no profit to them.

83. For when their apostles
 Came to them
 With Clear Signs, they exulted
 In such knowledge (and skill)

As they had; but
 That very (Wrath) at which
 They were wont to scoff
 Hemmed them in.

84. But when they saw
 Our Punishment, they said:
 "We believe in God,--
 The One God--and we
 Reject the partners we used
 To join with Him."

85. But their professing the Faith
 When they (actually) saw
 Our Punishment was not going
 To profit them.
 (Such has been) God's way
 Of dealing with His servants
 (From the most ancient times).
 And even thus did
 The rejecters of God
 Perish (utterly)!



  

Sura XLI.

  

Ha-mim (Abbreviated Letters), or Ha-Mim Sajda, or Fussilat



1. Ha-Mim:

2. A revelation from (God).
 Most Gracious, Most Merciful--

3. A Book, whereof the verses
 Are explained in detail;--
 A Qur-an in Arabic,
 For people who understand;--

4. Giving Good News
 And Admonition: yet most
 Of them turn away
 And so they hear not.

5. They say: "Our hearts are
 Under veils, (concealed)
 From that to which thou
 Dost invite us, and
 In our ears is a deafness,
 And between us and thee
 Is a screen: so do
 Thou (what thou wilt);

For us, we shall do
 (What we will!)"

6. Say thou: "I am
 But a man like you:
 It is revealed to me
 By inspiration, that your God
 Is One God: so stand
 True to Him, and ask
 For His forgiveness."
 And woe to those who
 Join gods with God,--

7. Those who practise not
 Regular Charity, and who
 Even deny the Hereafter.

8. For those who believe
 And work deeds of righteousness
 Is a reward that will
 Never fail.

  

SECTION 2.

9. Say: Is it that ye
 Deny Him Who created
 The earth in two Days?
 And do ye join equals
 With Him? He is
 The Lord of (all)
 The Worlds.

10. He set on the (earth),
 Mountains standing firm,
 High above it,
 And bestowed blessings on
 The earth, and measured therein
 All things to give them
 Nourishment in due proportion,
 In four Days, in accordance
 With (the needs of)
 Those who seek (sustenance).

11. Moreover He comprehended
 In His design the sky,
 And it had been (as) smoke:
 He said to it
 And to the earth:
 "Come ye together,
 Willingly or unwillingly."
 They said: "We do come
 (Together), in willing obedience."

12. So he completed them
 As seven firmaments

In two Days, and He
 Assigned to each heaven
 Its duty and command.
 And We adorned
 The lower heaven
 With lights, and (provided it)
 With guard. Such
 Is the Decree of (Him)
 The Exalted in Might,
 Full of knowledge.

13. But if they turn away,
 Say thou: "I have warned
 You of a stunning Punishment
 (As of thunder and lightning)
 Like that which (overtook)
 The 'Ad and the Thamud!"

14. Behold, the apostles came
 To them, from before them
 And behind them, (preaching):
 "Serve none but God."
 They said, "If our Lord
 Had so pleased, He would

Certainly have sent down angels
 (To preach): now we reject
 Your mission (altogether)."

15. Now the 'Ad behaved
 Arrogantly through the land,
 Against (all) truth and reason,
 And said: "Who is superior
 To us in strength?" What!
 Did they not see that
 God, Who created them,
 Was superior to them
 In strength? But they
 Continued to reject Our Signs!

16. So We sent against them
 A furious Wind through days
 Of disaster, that We might
 Give them a taste
 Of a Penalty of humiliation
 In this Life; but the Penalty
 Of a Hereafter will be
 More humiliating still:
 And they will find
 No help.

17. As to the Thamud,
 We gave them guidance,
 But they preferred blindness
 (Of heart) to Guidance:
 So the stunning Punishment
 Of humiliation seized them,
 Because of what they had earned.

18. But We delivered those
 Who believed and practised righteousness.

  

SECTION 3.

19. On the Day that
 The enemies of God
 Will be gathered together
 To the Fire, they will
 Be marched in ranks.

20. At length, when they reach
 The (Fire), their hearing,
 Their sight, and their skins
 Will bear witness against them,
 As to (all) their deeds.

21. They will say to their skins:
 "Why bear ye witness
 Against us?" They will say:
 "God hath given us speech,--
 (He) Who giveth speech
 To everything: He created
 You for the first time,
 And unto Him were ye
 To return.

22. "Ye did not seek
 To hide yourselves, lest

Your hearing, your sight,
 And your skins should bear
 Witness against you! But
 Ye did think that God
 Knew not many of  things
 That ye used to do!

23. "But this thought of yours
 Which ye did entertain
 Concerning your Lord, hath
 Brought you to destruction,
 And (now) have ye become
 Of those utterly lost!"

24. If, then, they have patience,
 The Fire will be
 A Home for them!
 And if they beg
 To be received into favour,
 Into favour will they not
 (Then) be received.

25. And We have destined
 For them intimate companions
 (Of like nature), who made
 Alluring to them what was
 Before them and behind them;
 And the sentence among
 The previous generations of Jinns
 And men; who have passed away,

Is proved against them;
 For they are utterly lost.

  

SECTION 4.

26. The Unbelievers say
 "Listen not to this Qur-an,
 But talk at random
 In the midst
 Of its (reading), that ye
 May gain the upper hand!"

27. But We will certainly
 Give the Unbelievers a taste
 Of a severe Penalty,
 And We will requite them
 For the worst of their deeds.

28. Such is the requital
 Of the enemies of God,--
 The Fire: therein will be
 For them the Eternal Home:
 A (fit) requital, for
 That they were wont
 To reject Our Signs.

29. And the Unbelievers will say:
 "Our Lord! Show us those,
 Among Jinns and men,
 Who misled us: we shall
 Crush them beneath our feet,
 So that they become
 The vilest (before all)."

30. In the case of those
 Who say, "Our Lord

Is God", and, further,
 Stand straight and steadfast,
 The angels descend on them.
 (From time to time):
 "Fear ye not!" (they suggest),
 "Nor grieve! But receive
 The Glad Tidings
 Of the Garden (of Bliss),
 The which ye were promised!

31. "We are your protectors
 In this life and
 In the Hereafter:
 Therein shall ye have
 All that your souls
 Shall desire; therein
 Shall ye have all
 That ye ask for!--

32. "A hospitable gift from One
 Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful!"

  

SECTION 5.

33. Who is better in speech
 Than one who calls (men)
 To God, works righteousness,
 And says, "I am of those
 Who bow in Islam"?

34. Nor can Goodness and Evil
 Be equal. Repel (Evil)
 With what is better:
 Then will he between whom
 And thee was hatred
 Become as it were
 Thy friend and intimate!

35. And no one will be
 Granted such goodness
 Except those who exercise
 Patience and self-restraint,--
 None but persons of
 The greatest good fortune.

36. And if (at any time)
 An incitement to discord
 Is made to thee
 By the Evil One,
 Seek refuge in God.
 He is the One
 Who hears and knows
 All things.

37. Among His Signs are
 The Night and the Day,
 And the Sun and the Moon.
 Adore not the sun
 And the moon, but adore
 God, Who created them,
 If it is. Him ye wish
 To serve.

38. But if the (Unbelievers)
 Are arrogant, (no matter):
 For in the presence
 Of thy Lord are those
 Who celebrate His praises
 By night and by day.
 And they never flag
 (Nor feel themselves
 Above it).

39. And among His Signs
 In this: thou seest
 The earth barren and desolate;
 But when We send down
 Rain to it, it is stirred
 To life and yields increase.
 Truly, He Who gives life
 To the (dead) earth
 Can surely give life
 To (men) who are dead.
 For He has power
 Over all things.

40. Those who pervert
 The Truth in Our Signs
 Are not hidden from Us.
 Which is better?--he that
 Is cast into the Fire,
 Or he that comes safe through,
 On the Day of Judgment?
 Do what ye will:
 Verily He seeth (clearly)
 All that ye do.

41. Those who reject the Message
 When it comes to them

(Are not hidden from Us).
 And indeed it is a Book
 Of exalted power.

42. No falsehood can approach it
 From before or behind it:
 It is sent down
 By One Full of Wisdom,
 Worthy of all Praise.

43. Nothing is said to thee
 That was not said
 To the apostles before thee:
 That thy Lord has
 At His command (all) Forgiveness
 As well as a most
 Grievous Penalty.

44. Had We sent this as
 A Qur-an (in a language)
 Other than Arabic, they would
 Have said: "Why are not
 Its verses explained in detail?
 What! (a Book) not in Arabic
 And (a Messenger) an Arab?"
 Say: "It is a guide

And a healing to those
 Who believe; and for those
 Who believe not, there is
 A deafness in their ears,
 And it is blindness in their (eyes):
 They are (as it were)
 Being called from a place
 Far distant!"

  

SECTION 6.

45. We certainly gave Moses
 The Book aforetime: but disputes
 Arose therein. Had it not
 Been for a Word
 That went forth before
 From thy Lord, (their differences)
 Would have been settled
 Between them: but they
 Remained in suspicious
 Disquieting doubt thereon.

46. Whoever works righteousness
 Benefits his own soul;
 Whoever works evil, it is
 Against his own soul:
 Nor is thy Lord ever
 Unjust (in the least)
 To His servants.

47. To Him is referred
 The Knowledge of the Hour
 (Of Judgment: He knows all):
 No date-fruit comes out
 Of its sheath, nor does
 A female conceive (within
 Her womb) nor bring forth
 (Young), but by His Knowledge.
 The Day that (God) will propound
 To them the (question),
 "Where are the Partners
 (Ye attributed) to Me?"
 They will say, "We do
 Assure Thee not one
 Of us can bear witness!"

48. The (deities) they used to invoke
 Aforetime will leave them
 In the lurch, and they
 Will perceive that they
 Have no way of escape.

49. Man does not weary
 Of asking for good (things),
 But if ill touches him,
 He gives up all hope
 (And) is lost in despair.

50. When We give him a taste
 Of some mercy from Ourselves.

After some adversity has
 Touched him, he is sure
 To say, "This is due
 To my (merit): I think not
 That the Hour (of Judgment)
 Will (ever) be established;
 But if I am brought back
 To my Lord, I have
 (Much) good (stored) in His sight!"
 But We will show
 The Unbelievers the truth
 Of all that they did,
 And We shall give them
 The taste of a severe
 Penalty.

51. When We bestow favours
 On man, he turns away,
 And gets himself remote
 On his side (instead of'
 Coming to Us); and when
 Evil seizes him, (he comes)
 Full of prolonged prayer!

52. Say: "See ye if
 The (Revelation) is (really)
 From God, and yet do ye
 Reject it? Who is more
 Astray than one who
 Is in a schism
 Far (from any purpose)?"

53. Soon will We show them
 Our Signs in the (furthest)

Regions (of the earth), and
 In their own souls, until
 It becomes manifest to them
 That this is the Truth.
 Is it not enough that
 Thy Lord doth witness
 All things?

54. Ah indeed! are they
 In doubt concerning
 The Meeting with their Lord?
 Ah indeed! it is He
 That doth encompass
 All things!



  

Sura XLII.

  

Shura, or Consultation.



1. Ha-Mim;

2. 'Ain. Sin. Kaf.

3. Thus doth (He) send
 Inspiration to thee
 As (He did) to those before thee,--
 God, Exalted in Power,
 Full of Wisdom.

4. To Him belongs all
 That is in the heavens
 And on earth: and He
 Is Most High, Most Great.

5. The heavens are almost
 Rent asunder from above them
 (By His Glory):
 And the angels celebrate
 The Praises of their Lord,
 And pray for forgiveness
 For (all) beings on earth:
 Behold! Verily God is He,

The Oft-Forgiving,
 Most Merciful.

6. And those who take
 As protectors others besides
 Him,--
 God doth watch over them;
 And thou art not
 The disposer of their affairs.

7. Thus have We sent
 By inspiration to thee
 An Arabic Qur-an:
 That thou mayest warn
 The Mother of Cities
 And all around her,--
 And warn (them) of
 The Day of Assembly,
 Of which there is no doubt:
 (When) some will be
 In the Garden, and some
 In the Blazing Fire.

8. If God had so willed,
 He could have made them
 A single people; but He
 Admits whom He will
 To His Mercy;
 And the wrong-doers
 Will have no protector
 Nor helper.

9. What! Have they taken
 (For worship) protectors

Besides Him? But it is
 God,--He is the Protector,
 And it is He Who
 Gives life to the dead:
 It is He Who has power
 Over all things.

  

SECTION 2.

10. Whatever it be wherein
 Ye differ, the decision
 Thereof is with God:
 Such is God my Lord:
 In Him I trust,
 And to Him I turn.

11. (He is) the Creator
 Of the heavens and
 The earth: He has made
 For you pairs
 From among yourselves,
 And pairs among cattle:
 By this means does He
 Multiply you: there is nothing
 Whatever like unto Him,
 And He is the One
 That hears and sees (all things).

12. To Him belong the keys
 Of the heavens and the earth:

He enlarges and restricts.
 The Sustenance to whom
 He will: for He knows
 Full well all things.

13. The same religion has He
 Established for you as that
 Which He enjoined on Noah--
 The which We have sent
 By inspiration to thee--
 And that which We enjoined
 On Abraham, Moses, and Jesus:
 Namely, that ye should remain
 Steadfast in Religion, and make
 No divisions therein:
 To those who worship
 Other things than God,
 Hard is the (way)
 To which thou callest them,
 God chooses to Himself
 Those whom He pleases,
 And guides to Himself
 Those who turn (to Him).

14. And they became divided
 Only after knowledge
 Reached them,--through selfish
 Envy as between themselves.
 Had it not been
 For a Word that

Went forth before
 From thy Lord,
 (Tending) to a Term appointed,
 The matter would have
 Been settled between them:
 But truly those who have
 Inherited the Book after them
 Are in suspicious (disquieting)
 Doubt concerning it.

15. Now then, for that (reason),
 Call (them to the Faith),
 And stand steadfast
 As thou art commanded,
 Nor follow thou their vain
 Desires; but say: "I believe
 In the Book which
 God has sent down;
 And I am commanded
 To judge justly between you.
 God is our Lord
 And your Lord. For us
 (Is the responsibility for)
 Our deeds, and for you
 For your deeds. There is
 No contention between us
 And you. God will
 Bring us together,
 And to Him is
 (Our) final goal.

16. But those who dispute
 Concerning God after He
 Has been accepted,--
 Futile is their dispute
 In the sight of
 Their Lord: on them
 Is Wrath, and for them
 Will be a Penalty
 Terrible.

17. It is God Who has
 Sent down the Book in truth,
 And the Balance
 (By which to weigh conduct).
 And what will make thee
 Realise that perhaps the Hour
 Is close at hand?

18. Only those wish to
 Hasten it who believe not
 In it: those who believe
 Hold it in awe,
 And know that it is
 The Truth. Behold, verily
 Those that dispute concerning
 The Hour are far astray.

19. Gracious is God
 To His servants:

He gives Sustenance
 To whom He pleases:
 And He has Power
 And can carry out
 His Will.

  

SECTION 3.

20. To any that desires
 The tilth of the Hereafter,
 We give increase
 In his tilth; and to any
 That desires the tilth
 Of this world, We grant
 Somewhat thereof, but he
 Has no share or lot
 In the Hereafter.

21. What! Have they partners
 (In godhead), who have
 Established for them some
 Religion without the permission
 Of God? Had it not
 Been for the Decree
 Of Judgment, the matter
 Would have been decided
 Between them (at once).
 But verily the wrong-doers
 Will have a grievous Penalty.

22. Thou wilt see the wrong-doers
 In fear on account of what

They have earned, and (the burden
 Of) that must (necessarily)
 Fall on them. But those
 Who believe and work
 Righteous deeds will be
 In the luxuriant meads
 Of the Gardens: they shall
 Have, before their Lord,
 All that they wish for.
 That will indeed be
 The magnificent Bounty
 (Of God).

23. That is (the Bounty) whereof
 God gives Glad Tidings
 To His Servants who
 Believe and do righteous deeds.
 Say: "No reward do I
 Ask of you for this
 Except the love
 Of those near of kin."
 And if any one earns
 Any good, We shall give
 Him an increase of good
 In respect thereof: for God
 Is Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready
 To appreciate (service).

24. What! Do they say,
 "He has forged a falsehood
 Against God"? But if God
 Willed, He could seal up

Thy heart. And God
 Blots out Vanity, and proves
 The Truth by His Words.
 For He knows well
 The secrets of all hearts.

25. He is the One that accepts
 Repentance from His Servants
 And forgives sins:
 And He knows all
 That ye do.

26. And He listens to
 Those who believe and
 Do deeds of righteousness,
 And gives them increase
 Of His Bounty: but
 For the Unbelievers there is
 A terrible Penalty.

27. If God were to enlarge
 The provision for His Servants,
 They would indeed transgress
 Beyond all bounds
 Through the earth;
 But He sends (it) down
 In due measure
 As He pleases.
 For He is with His Servants
 Well-acquainted, Watchful.

28. He is the One that sends down
 Rain (even) after (men) have

Given up all hope,
 And scatters His Mercy
 (Far and wide). And He
 Is the Protector, Worthy
 Of all Praise.

29. And among His Signs
 Is the creation of
 The heavens and the earth,
 And the living creatures
 That He has scattered
 Through them: and He
 Has power to gather them
 Together when He wills.

  

SECTION 4.

30. Whatever misfortune
 Happens to you, is because

Of the things your hands
 Have wrought, and for many
 (Of them) He grants forgiveness.

31. Nor can ye frustrate (aught),
 (Fleeing) through the earth;
 Nor have ye, besides God,
 Any one to protect
 Or to help.

32. And among His Signs
 Are the ships, smooth-running
 Through the ocean, (tall)
 As mountains.

33. If it be His Will,
 He can still the Wind:
 Then would they become
 Motionless on the back
 Of the (ocean). Verily
 In this are Signs
 For everyone who patiently
 Perseveres and is grateful.

34. Or He can cause them
 To perish because of
 The (evil) which (the men)
 Have earned; but much
 Doth He forgive.

35. But let those know, who
 Dispute about Our Signs,
 That there is for them
 No way of escape.

36. Whatever ye are given (here)
 Is (but) a convenience
 Of this Life: but that
 Which is with God
 Is better and more lasting:
 (It is) for those who believe
 And put their trust
 In their Lord;

37. Those who avoid the greater
 Crimes and shameful deeds,
 And, when they are angry
 Even then forgive;

38. Those who hearken
 To their Lord, and establish

Regular prayer; who (conduct)
 Their affairs by mutual
 Consultation;
 Who spend out of what
 We bestow on them
 For Sustenance;

39. And those who, when
 An oppressive wrong is inflicted
 On them, (are not cowed
 But) help and defend themselves.

40. The recompense for an injury
 Is an injury equal thereto
 (In degree): but if a person
 Forgives and makes reconciliation,

His reward is due
 From God: for (God)
 Loveth not those who
 Do wrong.

41. But indeed if any do help
 And defend themselves
 After a wrong (done)
 To them, against such
 There is no cause
 Of blame.

42. The blame is only
 Against those who oppress
 Men with wrong-doing
 And insolently transgress
 Beyond bounds through the land,
 Defying right and justice:
 For such there will be
 A Penalty grievous.

43. But indeed if any
 Show patience and forgive,
 That would truly be
 An exercise of courageous will
 And resolution in the conduct
 Of affairs.

  

SECTION 5.

44. For any whom God
 Leaves astray, there is
 No protector thereafter.
 And thou wilt see
 The wrong-doers, when
 In sight of the Penalty,
 Say: "Is there any way
 (To effect) a return?"

45. And thou wilt see them
 Brought forward to the (Penalty),
 In a humble frame of mind
 Because of (their) disgrace,
 (And) looking with a stealthy
 Glance. And the Believers
 Will say: "Those are indeed.
 In loss. who have given
 To perdition their own selves
 And those belonging to them
 On the Day of Judgment.
 Behold! Truly the wrong-doers
 Are in a lasting Penalty!"

46. And no protectors have they
 To help them,
 Other than God.
 And for any whom God
 Leaves to stray, there is
 No way (to the Goal).

47. Hearken ye to your Lord,
 Before there come a Day
 Which there will be
 No putting back, because
 Of (the ordainment of) God!
 That Day there will be
 For you no place of refuge
 Nor will there be for you
 Any room for denial
 (Of your sins)!

48. If then they turn away,
 We have not sent thee
 As a guard over them.
 Thy duty is but to convey
 (The Message). And truly,
 When We give man
 A taste of a Mercy
 From ourselves, he doth
 Exult thereat, but
 When some ill happens
 To him, on account
 Of the deeds which
 His hands have sent forth,
 Truly then is man ungrateful!

49. To God belongs the dominion
 Of the heavens and the earth.
 He creates what He wills
 (And plans). He bestows

(Children) male or female
 According to His Will (and Plan),

50. Or He bestows both males
 And females, and He leaves
 Barren whom He will:
 For He is full
 Of knowledge and power.

51. It is not fitting
 For a man that God
 Should speak to him
 Except by inspiration,
 Or from behind a veil,
 Or by the sending
 Of a Messenger
 To reveal, with God's permission,
 What God wills: for He
 Is Most High, Most Wise.

52. And thus have We,
 By Our command, sent

Inspiration to thee:
 Thou knewest not (before)
 What was Revelation, and
 What was Faith; but We
 Have made the (Qur-an)
 A Light, wherewith We
 Guide such of Our servants
 As We will; and verily
 Thou dost guide (men)
 To the Straight Way,--

53. The Way of God,
 To Whom belongs
 Whatever is in the heavens
 And whatever is on earth.
 Behold (how) all affairs
 Tend towards God!



  

Sura XLIII.

  

Zukhruf, or Gold Adornments.



1. Ha-Mim

2. By the Book that
 Makes things clear,--

3. We have made it
 A Qur-an in: Arabic,
 That ye may be able
 To understand (and learn wisdom).

4. And verily, it is
 In the Mother of the Book,
 In Our Presence, high
 (In dignity), full of wisdom.

5. Shall We then
 Take away the Message
 From you and repel (you),
 For that ye are a people
 Transgressing beyond bounds?

6. But how many were
 The prophets We sent
 Amongst the peoples of old?

7. And never came there
 A prophet to them
 But they mocked him.

8. So We destroyed (them)--
 Stronger in power than these;--
 And (thus) has passed on
 The Parable of the peoples
 Of old.

9. If thou wert
 To question them, "Who created
 The heavens and the earth?''
 They would be sure to reply,
 "They were created by (Him),
 The Exalted in Power,
 Full of Knowledge";--

10. (Yea, the same that)
 Has made for you
 The earth (like a carpet)
 Spread out, and has made
 For you roads (and channels)
 Therein, in order that ye
 May find guidance (on the way);

11. That sends down
 (From time to time)

Rain from the sky
 In due measure;--
 And We raise to life
 Therewith a land that is
 Dead; even so will ye
 Be raised (from the dead);--

12. That has created pairs
 In all things, and has made
 For you ships and cattle
 On which ye ride,

13. In order that ye may
 Sit firm and square
 On their backs, and when
 So seated, ye may
 Celebrate the (kind) favour
 Of your Lord, and say,
 "Glory to Him Who
 Has subjected these
 To our (use), for we
 Could never have accomplished
 This (by ourselves),

14. "And to our Lord, surely,
 Must we turn back!"

15. Yet they attribute
 To some of His servants
 A share with Him
 (In His godhead)!
 Truly is man a blasphemous
 Ingrate avowed!

  

SECTION 2.

16. What! Has He taken
 Daughters out of what He
 Himself creates, and granted
 To you sons for choice?

17. When news is brought
 To one of them of (the birth
 Of) what he sets up
 As a likeness to (God)
 Most Gracious, his face
 Darkens, and he is filled
 With inward grief!

18. Is then one brought up
 Among trinkets, and unable
 To give a clear account
 In a dispute (to be
 Associated with God)?

19. And they make into females
 Angels who themselves serve

God. Did they witness
 Their creation? Their evidence
 Will be recorded, and they
 Will be called to account!

20. ("Ah!") they say, "If
 It had been the Will
 Of (God) Most Gracious,
 We should not have
 Worshipped such (deities)!"
 Of that they have
 No knowledge! They
 Do nothing but lie!

21. What! have We given them
 A Book before this,
 To which they are
 Holding fast?

22. Nay! they say: "We found
 Our fathers following
 A certain religion,
 And we do guide ourselves
 By their footsteps."

23. Just in the same way,
 Whenever We sent a Warner
 Before thee to any people,
 The wealthy ones among them
 Said: "We found our fathers
 Following a certain religion,
 And we will certainly
 Follow in their footsteps."

24. He said: "What!
 Even if I brought you
 Better guidance than that
 Which ye found
 Your fathers following?"
 They said: "For us,
 We deny that ye (prophets)
 Are sent (on a mission
 At all)."

25. So We exacted retribution
 From them: now see
 What was the end
 Of those who rejected (Truth)!

  

SECTION 3.

26. Behold! Abraham said
 To his father and his people:
 "I do indeed clear myself
 Of what ye worship:

27. "(I worship) only Him
 Who made me, and He
 Will certainly guide me."

28. And he left it
 As a Word
 To endure among those
 Who came after him,
 That they may turn back
 (To God).

29. Yea, I have given
 The good things of this life
 To these (men) and
 Their fathers, until the Truth
 Has come to them,
 And an Apostle
 Making things clear.

30. But when the Truth came
 To them, they said:
 "This is sorcery, and we
 Do reject it."

31. Also, they say: "Why
 Is not this Qur-an sent
 Down to some leading man
 In either of the two
 (Chief) cities?"

32. Is it they who would portion out
 The Mercy of thy Lord?
 It is We Who portion out
 Between them their livelihood

In the life of this world:
 And We raise some of them
 Above others in ranks,
 So that some may command
 Work from others.
 But the Mercy of thy Lord
 Is better than the (wealth)
 Which they amass.

33. And were it not that
 (All) men might become
 Of one (evil) way of life,
 We would provide,
 For everyone that blasphemes
 Against (God) Most Gracious,
 Silver roofs for their houses,
 And (silver) stair-ways
 On which to go up,

34. And (silver) doors
 To their houses, and thrones
 (Of silver) on which
 They could recline,

35. And also adornments
 Of gold. But all this
 Were nothing but conveniences
 Of the present life:
 The Hereafter, in the sight
 Of thy Lord, is
 For the Righteous.

  

SECTION 4.

36. If anyone withdraws himself
 From remembrance

Of (God) Most Gracious,
 We appoint for him
 An evil one, to be
 An intimate companion to him.

37. Such (evil ones) really
 Hinder them from the Path,
 But they think that they
 Are being guided aright!

38. At length, when (such a one)
 Comes to Us, he says
 (To his evil companion):
 "Would that between me
 And thee were the distance
 Of East and West!" Ah!
 Evil is the companion (indeed)!

39. When ye have done wrong,
 It will avail you nothing,
 That day, that ye shall be
 Partners in punishment!

40. Canst thou then make
 The deaf to hear, or give
 Direction to the blind
 Or to such as (wander)
 In manifest error?

41. Even if We take thee
 Away, We shall be sure
 To exact retribution from them,

42. Or We shall show thee
 That (accomplished) which We
 Have promised them:
 For verily We shall
 Prevail over them.

43. So hold thou fast
 To the Revelation sent down
 To thee: verily thou
 Art on a Straight Way.

44. The (Qur-an) is indeed
 The Message, for thee
 And for thy people;
 And soon shall ye
 (All) be brought to account.

45. And question thou our apostles
 Whom We sent before thee;
 Did We appoint any deities
 Other than (God) Most Gracious,
 To be worshipped?

  

SECTION 5.

46. We did send Moses
 Aforetime, with Our Signs,

To Pharaoh and his Chiefs:
 He said, "I am an apostle
 Of the Lord of the Worlds."

47. But when he came to them
 With Our Signs, behold,
 They ridiculed them.

48. We showed them Sign
 After Sign, each greater
 Than, its fellow, and We
 Seized them with Punishment,
 In order that they
 Might turn (to Us).

49. And they said, "O thou
 Sorcerer! Invoke thy Lord
 For us according to
 His covenant with thee;
 For we shall truly
 Accept guidance."

50. But when We removed
 The Penalty from them,
 Behold, they broke their word.

51. And Pharaoh proclaimed
 Among his people, saying:
 "O my people! Does not
 The dominion of Egypt
 Belong to me, (witness)
 These streams flowing
 Underneath my (palace)? What!
 See ye not then?

52. "Am I not better
 Than this (Moses), who
 Is a contemptible wretch
 And can scarcely
 Express himself clearly?

53. "Then why are not
 Gold bracelets bestowed
 On him, or (why)
 Come (not) with him
 Angels accompanying him
 In procession?"

54. Thus did he make
 Fools of his people,
 And they obeyed him:
 Truly were they a people
 Rebellious (against God).

55. When at length they
 Provoked Us, We exacted
 Retribution from them, and
 We drowned them all.

56. And We made them
 (A people) of the Past
 And an Example
 To later ages.

  

SECTION 6.

57. When (Jesus) the son
 Of Mary is held up
 As an example, behold,
 Thy people raise a clamour
 Thereat (in ridicule)!

58. And they say, "Are
 Our gods best, or he?"
 This they set forth
 To thee, only by way
 Of disputation: yea, they
 Are a contentious people.

59. He was no more than
 A servant: We granted
 Our favour to him,
 And We made him
 An example to the Children
 Of Israel.

60. And if it were Our Will,
 We could make angels
 From amongst you, succeeding
 Each other on the earth.

61. And (Jesus) shall be
 A Sign (for the coming
 Of) the Hour (of Judgment):
 Therefore have no doubt
 About the (Hour), but
 Follow ye Me: this
 Is a Straight Way.

62. Let not the Evil One
 Hinder you: for he is
 To you an enemy avowed.

63. When Jesus came
 With Clear Signs, he said:
 "Now have I come
 To you with Wisdom,
 And in order to make
 Clear to you some
 Of the (points) on which
 Ye dispute: therefore fear God
 And obey me.

64. "For God, He is my Lord
 And your Lord: so worship
 Ye Him: this is
 A Straight Way."

65. But sects from among
 Themselves fell into disagreement:
 Then woe to the wrong-doers,
 From the Penalty
 Of a Grievous Day!

66. Do they only wait
 For the Hour--that it
 Should come on them
 All of a sudden,
 While they perceive not?

67. Friends on that Day
 Will be foes, one
 To another,--except
 The Righteous.

  

SECTION 7.

68. My devotees
 No fear shall be
 On you that Day,
 Nor shall ye grieve,--

69. (Being) those who have believed
 In Our Signs and bowed
 (Their wills to Ours) in Islam.

70. Enter ye the Garden,
 Ye and your wives,
 In (beauty and) rejoicing.

71. To them will be passed
 Round, dishes and goblets
 Of gold: there will be
 There all that the souls
 Could desire, all that
 The eyes could delight in:
 And ye shall abide
 Therein (for aye).

72. Such will be the Garden
 Of which ye are made
 Heirs for your (good) deeds
 (In life).

73. Ye shall have therein
 Abundance of fruit, from which
 Ye shall have satisfaction.

74. The Sinners will be
 In the Punishment of Hell,
 To dwell therein (for aye):

75. Nowise will the (punishment)
 Be lightened for them,
 And in despair will they
 Be there overwhelmed.

76. Nowise shall We
 Be unjust to them:

But it is they who
 Have been unjust themselves.

77. They will cry: "O Malik!
 Would that thy Lord
 Put an end to us!"
 He will say, "Nay, but
 Ye shall abide!"

78. Verily We have brought
 The Truth to you:
 But most of you
 Have a hatred for Truth.

79. What! Have they settled
 Some Plan (among themselves)?
 But it is We Who
 Settle things.

80. Or do they think
 That We hear not
 Their secrets and their
 Private counsels? Indeed
 (We do), and Our Messengers
 Are by them, to record.

81. Say: If (God) Most Gracious
 Had a son, I would
 Be the first to worship."

82. Glory to the Lord
 Of the heavens and the earth,

The Lord of the Throne
 (Of Authority)! (He is
 Free) from the things
 They attribute (to Him)!

83. So leave them to babble
 And play (with vanities)
 Until they meet that Day,
 Of theirs, which they
 Have been promised.

84. It is He Who is God
 In heaven and God on earth;
 And He is Full
 Of Wisdom and Knowledge.

85. And blessed is He
 To Whom belongs the dominion
 Of the heavens and the earth,
 And all between them:
 With Him is the knowledge
 Of the Hour (of Judgment):
 And to Him shall ye
 Be brought back.

86. And those whom they invoke
 Besides God have no power
 Of intercession;--only he
 Who bears witness to the Truth,
 And they know (him).

87. If thou ask them, Who
 Created them, they will
 Certainly say, God: how
 Then are they deluded
 Away (from the Truth)?

88. (God has knowledge)
 Of the (Prophet's) cry,
 "O my Lord! Truly
 These are a people
 Who will not believe!"

89. But turn away from them,
 And say "Peace!"
 But soon shall they know!



  

Sura XLIV.

  

Dukhan, or Smoke (or Mist.)



1. Ha-Mim.

2. By the Book that
 Makes things clear;--

3. We sent it down
 During a blessed night:
 For We (ever) wish
 To warn (against Evil).

4. In that (night) is made
 Distinct every affair
 Of wisdom,

5. By command, from Our
 Presence. For We (ever)
 Send (revelations),

6. As a Mercy
 From thy Lord:
 For He hears and knows
 (All things);

7. The Lord of the heavens
 And the earth and all

Between them, if ye (but)
 Have an assured faith.

8. There is no god but He:
 It is He Who gives life
 And gives death,
 The Lord and Cherisher
 To you and your earliest
 Ancestors.

9. Yet they play about
 In doubt.

10. Then watch thou
 For the Day
 That the sky will
 Bring forth a kind
 Of smoke (or mist)
 Plainly visible,

11. Enveloping the people:
 This will be a Penalty
 Grievous.

12. (They will say:)
 "Our Lord! Remove
 The Penalty from us,
 For we do really believe!"

13. How shall the Message
 Be (effectual) for them,
 Seeing that an Apostle
 Explaining things clearly
 Has (already) come to them,--

14. Yet they turn away
 From him and say: "Tutored
 (By others), a man possessed!"

15. We shall indeed remove
 The Penalty for a while,
 (But) truly ye will revert
 (To your ways).

16. One day We shall seize
 You with a mighty onslaught:
 We will indeed (then)
 Exact Retribution!

17. We did, before them,
 Try the people of Pharaoh:

There came to them
 An apostle most honourable,

18. Saying: "Restore to me
 The servants of God:
 I am to you an apostle
 Worthy of all trust;

19. "And be not arrogant
 As against God:
 For I come to you
 With authority manifest.

20. "For me, I have sought
 Safety with my Lord
 And your Lord, against
 Your injuring me.

21. "If ye believe me not,
 At least keep yourselves
 Away from me."

22. (But they were aggressive:)
 Then he cried

To his Lord:
 "These are indeed
 A people given to sin."

23. (The reply came:)
 "March forth with my servants
 By night: for ye are
 Sure to be pursued.

24. "And leave the sea
 As a furrow (divided):
 For they are a host
 (Destined) to be drowned."

25. How many were the gardens
 And springs they left behind,

26. And corn-fields
 And noble buildings,

27. And wealth (and conveniences
 Of life), wherein they
 Had taken such delight!

28. Thus (was their end)!
 And We made other people
 Inherit (those things)!

29. And neither heaven
 Nor earth shed a tear
 Over them: nor were
 They given a respite (again).

  

SECTION 2.

30. We did deliver aforetime
 The Children of Israel
 From humiliating Punishment,

31. Inflicted by Pharaoh, for he
 Was arrogant (even) among
 Inordinate transgressors.

32. And We chose them aforetime
 Above the nations, knowingly,

33. And granted them Signs
 In which there was
 A manifest trial.

34. As to these (Quraish),
 They say forsooth:

35. "There is nothing beyond
 Our first death,
 And we shall not
 Be raised again.

36. "Then bring (back)
 Our forefathers, if what
 Ye say is true!"

37. What! are they better
 Than the people of Tubba'
 And those who were
 Before them? We destroyed
 Them because they were
 Guilty of sin.

38. We created not
 The heavens, the earth,
 And all between them,
 Merely in (idle) sport:

39. We created them not
 Except for just ends:
 But most of them
 Do not understand.

40. Verily the Day of
 Sorting Out is the time
 Appointed for all of them,--

41. The Day when no protector
 Can avail his client
 In aught, and no help
 Can they receive,

42. Except such as receive
 God's Mercy: for He is
 Exalted in Might, Most Merciful.

  

SECTION 3.

43. Verily the tree
 Of  Zaqqum

44. Will be the food
 Of the Sinful,--

45. Like molten brass;
 It will boil
 In their insides,

46. Like the boiling
 Of scalding water.

47. (A voice will cry:
 "Seize ye him
 And drag him
 Into the midst
 Of the Blazing Fire!

48. "Then pour over his head
 The Penalty of Boiling Water

49. "Taste thou (this)!
 Truly wast thou
 Mighty, full of honour!

50. "Truly this is what
 Ye used to doubt!"

51. As to the Righteous
 (They will be) in
 A position of Security,

52. Among Gardens and Springs;

53. Dressed in fine silk
 And in rich brocade,
 They will face each other;

54. So; and We shall
 Join them to Companions
 With beautiful, big,
 And lustrous eyes.

55. There can they call
 For every kind of fruit
 In peace and security;

56. Nor will they there
 Taste Death, except the first
 Death; and He will preserve
 Them from the Penalty
 Of the Blazing Fire,--

57. As a Bounty from thy Lord!
 That will be
 The supreme achievement!

58. Verily, We have made
 This (Qur-an) easy,
 In thy tongue,
 In order that they
 May give heed.

59. So wait thou and watch;
 For they (too) are waiting.



  

Sura XLV.

  

Jathiya, or Bowing the Knee.



1. Ha-Mim.

2. The revelation
 Of the Book
 Is from God
 The Exalted in Power,
 Full of Wisdom.

3. Verily in the heavens
 And the earth, are Signs
 For those who believe.

4. And in the creation
 Of yourselves and the fact
 That animals are scattered
 (Through the earth), are Signs
 For those of assured Faith.

5. And in the alternation
 Of Night and Day,
 And the fact that God
 Sends down Sustenance from
 The sky, and revives therewith
 The earth after its death,

And in the change
 Of the winds,--are Signs
 For those that are wise.

6. Such are the Signs
 Of God, which We rehearse to thee
 In truth: then in what
 Exposition will they believe
 After (rejecting) God
 And His Signs?

7. Woe to each sinful
 Dealer in Falsehoods:

8. He hears the Signs
 Of God rehearsed to him,
 Yet is obstinate and lofty,
 As if he had not
 Heard them: then announce
 To him a Penalty Grievous!

9. And when he learns
 Something of Our Signs,
 He takes them in jest:
 For such there will be
 A humiliating Penalty.

10. In front of them is
 Hell: and of no profit
 To them is anything
 They may have earned,
 Nor any protectors they
 May have taken to themselves
 Besides God: for them
 Is a tremendous Penalty.

11. This is (true) Guidance:
 And for those who reject
 The Signs of their Lord,
 Is a grievous Penalty
 Of abomination.

  

SECTION 2.

12. It is God Who has
 Subjected the sea to you,
 That ships may sail
 Through it by His command,
 That ye may seek
 Of His Bounty, and that
 Ye may be grateful.

13. And He has subjected
 To you, as from Him,
 All that is in the heavens
 And on earth: behold,
 In that are Signs indeed
 For those who reflect.

14. Tell those who believe,
 To forgive those who
 Do not look forward
 To the Days of God:

It is for Him to recompense
 (For good or ill) each People
 According to what
 They have earned.

15. If any one does
 A righteous deed,
 It enures to the benefit
 Of his own soul;
 If he does evil,
 It works against
 (His own soul).
 In the end will ye
 (All) be brought back
 To your Lord.

16. We did aforetime
 Grant to the Children
 Of Israel the Book,
 The Power of Command,
 And Prophethood; We gave
 Them, for Sustenance, things
 Good and pure; and We
 Favoured them above the nations.

17. And We granted them
 Clear Signs in affairs

(Of Religion): it was only
 After knowledge had been
 Granted to them that they
 Fell into schisms, through
 Insolent envy among themselves
 Verily thy Lord will judge
 Between them on the Day
 Of Judgment as to those
 Matters in which they
 Set up differences.

18. Then we put thee
 On the (right) Way
 Of Religion: so follow
 Thou that (Way),
 And follow not the desires
 Of those who know not.

19. They will be of no
 Use to thee in the sight
 Of God: it is only
 Wrong-doers (that stand as)
 Protectors, one to another:
 But God is the Protector
 Of the Righteous.

20. These are clear evidences
 To men, and a Guidance
 And Mercy to those
 Of assured Faith.

21. What! do those who
 Seek after evil ways
 Think that We shall
 Hold them equal with
 Those who believe and
 Do righteous deeds,--that
 Equal will be their
 Life and their death?
 Ill is the judgment
 That they make.

  

SECTION 3.

22. God created the heavens
 And the earth for
 Just ends, and in order
 That each soul may find
 The recompense of what
 It has earned, and none
 Of them be wronged.

23. Then seest thou such
 A one as takes
 As his god his own
 Vain desire? God has,
 Knowing (him as such),
 Left him astray, and sealed
 His hearing and his heart
 (And understanding), and put

A cover on his sight.
 Who, then, will guide him
 After God (has withdrawn
 Guidance)? Will ye not
 Then receive admonition?

24. And they say: "What is
 There but our life
 In this world?
 We shall die and we live,
 And nothing but Time
 Can destroy us." But
 Of that they have no
 Knowledge: they merely conjecture:

25. And when Our Clear
 Signs are rehearsed to them,
 Their argument is nothing
 But this: they say, "Bring
 (Back) our forefathers, if
 What ye say is true!"

26. Say: "It is God Who
 Gives you life, then
 Gives you death; then
 He will gather you together
 For the Day of Judgment
 About which there is
 No doubt": but most
 Men do not understand.

  

SECTION 4.

27. To God belongs
 The dominion of the heavens
 And the earth, and
 The Day that the Hour

Of Judgment is established,--
 That Day will the dealers
 In Falsehood perish!

28. And thou wilt see
 Every sect bowing the knee:
 Every sect will be called
 To its Record: "This Day
 Shall ye be recompensed
 For all that ye did!

29. "This Our Record speaks
 About you with truth:
 For We were wont
 To put on record
 All that ye did."

30. Then, as to those who
 Believed and did righteous
 Deeds, their Lord will
 Admit them to His Mercy:
 That will be the Achievement's
 For all to see.

31. But as to those who
 Rejected God, (to them
 Will be said): "Were not
 Our Signs rehearsed to you?
 But ye were arrogant,
 And were a people
 Given to sin!

32. "And when it was said
 That the promise of God
 Was true, and that the Hour--
 There was no doubt
 About its (coming), ye
 Used to say, "We
 Know not what is
 The Hour: we only think
 It is an idea, and we
 Have no firm assurance."

33. Then will appear to them
 The evil (fruits) of what
 They did, and they will be
 Completely encircled by that
 Which they used to mock at!

34. It will also be said:
 "This Day We will forget
 You as ye forgot
 The meeting of this Day
 Of yours! And your
 Abode is the Fire, and
 No helpers have ye!

35. "This, because ye used
 To take the Signs of God
 In jest, and the life
 Of the world deceived you:
 (From) that Day, therefore,
 They shall not be taken out
 Thence, nor shall they be
 Received into Grace.

36. Then Praise be to God,
 Lord of the heavens
 And Lord of the earth,--
 Lord and Cherisher
 Of all the worlds!

37. To Him be Glory
 Throughout the heavens
 And the earth: and He
 Is Exalted in Power,
 Full of Wisdom!



  

Sura XLVI.

  

Ahqaf, or Winding Sand-tracts.



1. Ha-Mim.

2. The revelation
 Of the Book
 Is from God
 The Exalted in Power,
 Full of Wisdom.

3. We created not
 The heavens and the earth
 And all between them
 But for just ends, and
 For a term appointed:
 But those who reject Faith
 Turn away from that
 Whereof they are warned.

4. Say: "Do ye see
 What it is ye invoke
 Besides God? Show me
 What it is they
 Have created on earth,
 Or have they a share
 In the heavens?
 Bring me a Book

(Revealed) before this,
 Or any remnant of knowledge
 (Ye may have), if ye
 Are telling the truth!

5. And who is more astray
 Than one who invokes,
 Besides God, such as will
 Not answer him to the Day
 Of Judgment, and who
 (In fact) are unconscious
 Of their call (to them)?

6. And when mankind
 Are gathered together
 (At the Resurrection),
 They will be hostile
 To them and reject
 Their worship (altogether)!

7. When Our Clear Signs
 Are rehearsed to them,
 The Unbelievers say,
 Of the Truth
 When it comes to them:
 "This is evident sorcery!"

8. Or do they say,
 "He has forged it"?
 Say: "Had I forged it,
 Then can ye obtain
 No single (blessing) for me
 From God. He knows best
 Of that whereof ye talk
 (So glibly)! Enough is He

For a witness between me
 And you! And He is
 Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."

9. Say: "I am no bringer
 Of new-fangled doctrine
 Among the apostles, nor
 Do I know what will
 Be done with me or
 With you. I follow
 But that which is revealed
 To me by inspiration;
 I am but a Warner
 Open and clear."

10. Say: "See ye?
 If (this teaching) be
 From God, and ye reject it,
 And a witness from among
 The Children of Israel testifies
 To its similarity
 (With earlier scripture),
 And has believed
 While ye are arrogant,
 (How unjust ye are!)
 Truly, God guides not
 A people unjust."

  

SECTION 2.

11. The Unbelievers say
 Of those who believe:

"If (this Message) were
 A good thing, (such men)
 Would not have gone
 To it first, before us!"
 And seeing that they
 Guide not themselves thereby,
 They will say, "This is
 An (old,) old falsehood!"

12. And before this, was
 The Book of Moses
 As a guide and a mercy:
 And this Book confirms (it)
 In the Arabic tongue;
 To admonish the unjust,
 And as Glad Tidings.
 To those who do right.

13. Verily those who say,
 "Our Lord is God,"
 And remain firm
 (On that Path),
 On them shall be no fear,
 Nor shall they grieve.

14. Such shall be Companions
 Of the Garden, dwelling
 Therein (for aye): a recompense
 For their (good) deeds.

15. We have enjoined on man
 Kindness to his parents:
 In pain did his mother
 Bear him, and in pain
 Did she give him birth.
 The carrying of the (child)
 To his weaning is
 (A period of) thirty months.
 At length, when he reaches
 The age of full strength
 And attains forty years,
 He says, "O my Lord!
 Grant me that I may be
 Grateful for Thy favour
 Which Thou hast bestowed
 Upon me, and upon both
 My parents, and that I
 May work righteousness
 Such as Thou mayest approve;
 And be gracious to me
 In my issue. Truly
 Have I turned to Thee
 And truly do I bow
 (To Thee) in Islam."

16. Such are they from whom
 We shall accept the best
 Of their deeds and pass by
 Their ill deeds: (they shall

Be) among the Companions
 Of the Garden: a promise!
 Of truth, which was
 Made to them
 (In this life).

17. But (there is one)
 Who says to his parents,
 "Fie on you! Do ye
 Hold out the promise
 To me that I
 Shall be raised up,
 Even though generations
 Have passed before me
 (Without rising again)?"
 And they two seek
 God's aid, (and rebuke
 The son): "Woe to thee!
 Have Faith! For the promise
 Of God is true."
 But he says, "This is
 Nothing but tales
 Of the ancients!"

18. Such are they against whom
 Is proved the Sentence
 Among the previous generations
 Of Jinns and men, that have
 Passed away; for they will
 Be (utterly) lost.

19. And to all
 Are (assigned) degrees

According to the deeds
 Which they (have done),
 And in order that (God)
 May recompense their deeds,
 And no injustice be done
 To them.

20. And on the Day that
 The Unbelievers will be
 Placed before the Fire,
 (It will be said to them):
 "Ye received your good things
 In the life of the world,
 And ye took your pleasure
 Out of them: but to-day
 Shall ye be recompensed
 With a Penalty of humiliation:
 For that ye were arrogant
 On earth without just cause,
 And that ye (ever) transgressed."

  

SECTION 3.

21. Mention (Hud)
 One of 'Ad's (own) brethren:
 Behold, he warned his people
 About the winding Sand-tracts:
 But there have been Warners
 Before him and after him:
 "Worship ye none other
 Than God: truly I fear
 For you the Penalty
 Of a Mighty Day."

22. They said: "Hast thou come
 In order to turn us aside

From our gods? Then bring
 Upon us the (calamity)
 With which thou dost
 Threaten us, if thou
 Art telling the truth!"

23. He said: "The Knowledge
 (Of when it will come)
 Is only with God: I
 Proclaim to you the mission
 On which I have been sent:
 But I see that ye
 Are a people in ignorance!"...

24. Then, when they saw
 The (Penalty in the shape of)
 A cloud traversing the sky,
 Corning to meet their valleys,
 They said, "This cloud
 Will give us rain!"
 "Nay, it is the (calamity)
 Ye were asking to be
 Hastened!--a wind
 Wherein is a Grievous Penalty!

25. "Everything will it destroy
 By the command of its Lord!"
 Then by the morning they--
 Nothing was to be seen
 But (the ruins of) their houses!
 Thus do We recompense
 Those given to sin!

26. And We had firmly established
 Them in a (prosperity and) power
 Which We have not given
 To you (ye Quraish!)
 And We had endowed them
 With (faculties of)
 Hearing, seeing, heart and intellect
 But of no profit to them
 Were their (faculties of)
 Hearing, sight, and heart
 And intellect, when they
 Went on rejecting the Signs
 Of God; and they were
 (Completely) encircled
 By that which they
 Used to mock at!

  

SECTION 4.

27. We destroyed aforetime
 Populations round about you;
 And We have shown
 The Signs in various ways,
 That they may turn (to Us).

28. Why then was no help
 Forthcoming to them from those
 Whom they worshipped as gods,
 Besides God, as a means
 Of access (to God)? Nay,
 They left them in the lurch:
 But that was their
 Falsehood and their invention.

29\. Behold, We turned
 Towards thee a company
 Of Jinns (quietly) listening
 To the Qur-an: when they
 Stood in the presence
 Thereof, they said, "Listen
 In silence!" When the (reading)
 Was finished, they returned
 To their people, to warn
 (Them of their sins).

30. They said, "O our people!
 We have heard a Book
 Revealed after Moses,
 Confirming what came
 Before it: it guides (men)
 To the Truth and
 To a Straight Path.

31. "O our people, hearken
 To the one who invites
 (You) to God, and believe
 In him: He will forgive
 You your faults,
 And deliver you from
 A Penalty Grievous.

32. "If any does not hearken
 To the one who invites
 (Us) to God, he cannot
 Frustrate (God's Plan) on earth,
 And no protectors can he have
 Besides God: such men
 (Wander) in manifest error."

33. See they not that
 God, Who created the heavens
 And the earth, and never
 Wearied with their creation,
 Is able to give life
 To the dead? Yea, verily
 He has power over all things.

34. And on the Day that
 The Unbelievers will be
 Placed before the Fire,
 (They will be asked,)
 Is this not the Truth?"
 They will say, "Yea,
 By our Lord!"
 (One will say:)
 "Then taste ye
 The Penalty, for that ye
 Were wont to deny (Truth)!"

35. Therefore patiently persevere,
 As did (all) apostles
 Of inflexible purpose;
 And be in no haste
 About the (Unbelievers). On the Day
 That they see the (Punishment)
 Promised them, (it will be)
 As if they had not
 Tarried more than an hour
 In a single day. (Thine
 But) to proclaim the Message:
 But shall any be destroyed
 Except those who transgress?



  

Sura XLVII.

  

Muhammad (the Prophet).



1. Those who reject God
 And hinder (men) from
 The Path of God,
 Their deeds will God
 Render astray
 (From their mark).

2. But those who believe
 And work deeds of
 Righteousness, and believe
 In the (Revelation) sent down
 To Muhammad--for it is
 The Truth from their Lord,
 He will remove from them
 Their ills and improve
 Their condition.

3. This because those who
 Reject God follow vanities,
 While those who believe follow
 The Truth from their Lord:
 Thus does God set forth
 For men their lessons
 By similitudes.

4. Therefore, when ye meet
 The Unbelievers (in fight),

Smite at their necks;
 At length, when ye have
 Thoroughly subdued them,
 Bind a bond
 Firmly (on them): thereafter
 (Is the time for) either
 Generosity or ransom:
 Until the war lays down
 Its burdens. Thus (are ye
 Commanded): but if it
 Had been God's Will,
 He could certainly have exacted
 Retribution from them (Himself);
 But (He lets you fight)
 In order to test you,
 Some with others.
 But those who are slain
 In the way of God,
 He will never let
 Their deeds be lost.

5. Soon will He guide them
 And improve their condition,

6. And admit them to
 The Garden which He
 Has announced for them.

7. O ye who believe!
 If ye will aid
 (The cause of) God,
 He will aid you,
 And plant your feet firmly.

8. But those who reject (God),
 For them is destruction,
 And (God) will render
 Their deeds astray
 (From their mark).

9. That is because they
 Hate the Revelation of God;
 So He has made
 Their deeds fruitless.

10. Do they not travel
 Through the earth, and see
 What was the End
 Of those before them
 (Who did evil)?
 God brought utter destruction
 On them, and similar
 (Fates await) those who
 Reject God.

11. That is because God
 Is the Protector of those
 Who believe, but
 Those who reject God
 Have no protector.

  

SECTION 2.

12. Verily God will admit
 Those who believe and do
 Righteous deeds, to Gardens
 Beneath which rivers flow;

While those who reject God
 Will enjoy (this world)
 And eat as cattle eat;
 And the Fire will
 Be their abode.

13. And how many cities,
 With more power than
 Thy city which has
 Driven thee out,
 Have We destroyed
 (For their sins)?
 And there was none
 To aid them.

14. Is then one who is
 On a clear (Path)
 From his Lord,
 No better than one
 To whom the evil
 Of his conduct seems pleasing,
 And such as follow
 Their own lusts?

15. (Here is) a Parable
 Of the Garden which
 The righteous are promised:
 In it are rivers
 Of water incorruptible;
 Rivers of milk
 Of which the taste
 Never changes; rivers

Of wine, a joy
 To those who drink;
 And rivers of honey
 Pure and clear. In it
 There are for them
 All kinds of fruits;
 And Grace from their Lord.
 (Can those in such Bliss)
 Be compared to such as
 Shall dwell for ever
 In the Fire, and be given,
 To drink, boiling water,
 So that it cuts up
 Their bowels (to pieces)?

16. And among them are men
 Who listen to thee,
 But in the end, when they
 Go out from thee,
 They say to those who
 Have received Knowledge,
 "What is it he said
 Just then?" Such are
 Men whose hearts God
 Has sealed, and who
 Follow their own lusts.

17. But to those who receive
 Guidance, He increases
 The (light of) Guidance,
 And bestows on them
 Their Piety and Restraint
 (From evil).

18. Do they then only wait
 For the Hour,--that it
 Should come on them
 Of a sudden? But already
 Have come some tokens
 Thereof, and when it
 (Actually) is on them,
 How can they benefit
 Then by their admonition?

19. Know, therefore, that
 There is no god
 But God, and ask
 Forgiveness for thy fault,
 And for the men
 And women who believe:
 For God knows how ye
 Move about and how
 Ye dwell in your homes.

  

SECTION 3.

20. Those who believe say,
 "Why is not a Sura
 Sent down (for us)?"
 But when a Sura
 Of basic or categorical
 Meaning is revealed,
 And fighting is mentioned
 Therein, thou wilt see those
 In whose hearts is a disease
 Looking at thee with a look
 Of one in swoon at
 The approach of death.
 But more fitting for them--

21. Were it to obey
 And say what is just,
 And when a matter
 Is resolved on, it were
 Best for them if they
 Were true to God.

22. Then, is it
 To be expected of you,
 If ye were put in authority,
 That ye will do mischief
 In the land, and break
 Your ties of kith and kin?

23\. Such are the men
 Whom God has cursed
 For He has made them
 Deaf and blinded their sight.

24. Do they not then
 Earnestly seek to understand
 The Qur-an, or are
 Their hearts locked up
 By them?

25. Those who turn back
 As apostates after Guidance
 Was clearly shown to them,--
 The Evil One has instigated
 Them and buoyed them up
 With false hopes.

26. This, because they said
 To those who hate what
 God has revealed, "We
 Will obey you in part
 Of (this) matter"; but God
 Knows their (inner) secrets.

27. But how (will it be)
 When the angels take
 Their souls at death,
 And smite their faces
 And their backs?

28. This because they followed
 That which called forth
 The Wrath of God, and
 They hated God's good pleasure;
 So He made their deeds
 Of no effect.

  

SECTION 4.

29. Or do those in whose
 Hearts is a disease, think
 That God will not bring
 To light all their rancour?

30. Had We so willed,
 We could have shown them
 Up to thee, and thou
 Shouldst have known them
 By their marks: but surely
 Thou wilt know them
 By the tone of their speech!
 And God knows
 All that ye do.

31. And We shall try you
 Until We test those
 Among you who strive
 Their utmost and persevere
 In patience; and We shall
 Try your reported (mettle).

32. Those who reject God,
 Hinder (men) from
 The Path of God, and resist
 The Apostle, after Guidance

Has been clearly shown to them,
 Will not injure God
 In the least, but He
 Will make their deeds
 Of no effect.

33. O ye who believe!
 Obey God, and obey
 The Apostle, and make
 Not vain your deeds!

34. Those who reject God,
 And hinder (men) from the Path
 Of God, then die rejecting God,--
 God will not forgive them.

35. Be not weary and
 Faint-hearted, crying for peace,
 When ye should be
 Uppermost: for God is
 With you, and will never
 Put you in loss
 For your (good) deeds.

36. The life of this world
 Is but play and amusement:
 And if ye believe
 And guard against evil,
 He will grant you
 Your recompense, and will not

Ask you (to give up)
 Your possessions.

37. If He were to ask you
 For all of them, and
 Press you, ye would
 Covetously withhold, and He would
 Bring out all your ill-feeling.

38. Behold, ye are those
 Invited to spend
 (Of your substance)
 In the Way of God:
 But among you are some
 That are niggardly. But any
 Who are niggardly are so
 At the expense of
 Their own souls.
 But God is free
 Of all wants,
 And it is ye that are needy.
 If ye turn back
 (From the Path), He will
 Substitute in your stead
 Another people; then they
 Would not be like you!



  

Sura XLVIII.

  

Fat-h or Victory.


1. Verily We have granted
 Thee a manifest Victory:

2. That God may forgive thee
 Thy faults of the past
 And those to follow;
 Fulfil His favour to thee;
 And guide thee
 On the Straight Way;

3. And that God may help
 Thee with powerful help.

4. It is He Who sent
 Down Tranquillity
 Into the hearts of
 The Believers, that they may
 Add Faith to their Faith;--
 For to God belong

The Forces of the heavens
 And the earth; and God is
 Full of Knowledge and Wisdom;--

5. That He may admit
 The men and women
 Who believe, to Gardens
 Beneath which rivers flow,
 To dwell therein for aye,
 And remove their ills
 From them;--and that is,
 In the sight of God,
 The highest achievement
 (For man),--

6. And that He may punish
 The Hypocrites, men and
 Women, and the Polytheists,
 Men and women, who imagine
 An evil opinion of God.
 On them is a round
 Of Evil: the Wrath of God
 Is on them: He has cursed
 Them and got Hell ready
 For them: and evil
 Is it for a destination.

7. For to God belong
 The Forces of the heavens
 And the earth; and God is
 Exalted in Power,
 Full of Wisdom.

8. We have truly sent thee
 As a witness, as a
 Bringer of Glad Tidings,
 And as a Warner:

9. In order that ye
 (O men) may believe
 In God and His Apostle,
 That ye may assist
 And honour Him,
 And celebrate His praises
 Morning and evening.

10. Verily those who plight
 Their fealty to thee
 Do no less than plight
 Their fealty to God:
 The Hand of God is
 Over their hands:
 Then any one who violates
 His oath, does so
 To the harm of his own
 Soul, and any one who
 Fulfils what he has
 Covenanted with God,--
 God will soon grant him
 A great Reward.

  

SECTION 2.

11. The desert Arabs who
 Lagged behind will

Say to thee:
 "We were engaged in
 (Looking after) our flocks
 And herds, and our families:
 Do thou then ask
 Forgiveness for us.
 They say with their tongues
 What is not in their hearts.
 Say: "Who then has
 Any power at all
 (To intervene) on your behalf
 With God, if His Will
 Is to give you some loss
 Or to give you some profit?
 But God is well acquainted
 With all that ye do.

12. "Nay, ye thought that
 The Apostle and the Believers
 Would never return to
 Their families; this seemed
 Pleasing in your hearts, and
 Ye conceived an evil thought,
 For ye are a people
 Lost (in wickedness)."

13. And if any believe not
 In God and His Apostle,
 We have prepared,
 For those who reject God,
 A Blazing Fire!

14. To God belongs the dominion
 Of the heavens and the earth:
 He forgives whom He wills,
 And He punishes whom He

Wills: but God is
 Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

15. Those who lagged behind
 (Will say), when ye (are
 Free to) march and take
 Booty (in war): "Permit us
 To follow you." They wish
 To change God's decree:
 Say: "Not thus
 Will ye follow us:
 God has already declared
 (This) beforehand": then they
 Will say, "But ye are
 Jealous of us." Nay,
 But little do they understand
 (Such things).

16. Say to the desert Arabs
 Who lagged behind: "Ye
 Shall be summoned (to fight)
 Against a people given to
 Vehement war: then shall ye
 Fight, or they shall submit.
 Then if ye show obedience,
 God will grant you
 A goodly reward, but if
 Ye turn back as ye

Did before, He will punish
 You with a grievous Penalty."

17. No blame is there
 On the blind, nor is
 There blame on the lame,
 Nor on one ill (if he
 Joins not the war):
 But he that obeys God
 And His Apostle,--(God)
 Will admit him to Gardens
 Beneath which rivers flow;
 And he who turns back,
 (God) will punish him
 With a grievous Penalty.

  

SECTION 3.

18. God's Good Pleasure
 Was on the Believers
 When they swore Fealty
 To thee under the Tree:
 He knew what was
 In their hearts, and He
 Sent down Tranquillity
 To them; and He rewarded
 Them with a speedy Victory;

19. And many gains will they
 Acquire (besides): and God
 Is Exalted in Power,
 Full of Wisdom.

20. God has promised you
 Many gains that ye shall
 Acquire, and He has given
 You these beforehand; and
 He has restrained the hands
 Of men from you; that it
 May be a Sign for
 The Believers, and that
 He may guide you
 To a Straight Path;

21. And other gains (there are),
 Which are not within
 Your power, but which
 God has compassed: and God
 Has power over all things.

22. If the Unbelievers
 Should fight you, they would
 Certainly turn their backs;
 Then would they find
 Neither protector nor helper.

23. (Such has been) the practice
 (Approved) of God already
 In the past: no change
 Wilt thou find in
 The practice (approved) of God.

24. And it is He Who
 Has restrained their hands

From you and your hands
 From them in the midst
 Of Mecca, after that He
 Gave you the victory
 Over them. And God sees
 Well all that ye do.

25. They are the ones who
 Denied revelation and hindered you
 From the Sacred Mosque
 And the sacrificial animals,
 Detained from reaching their
 Place of sacrifice. Had there
 Not been believing men
 And believing women whom
 Ye did not know that
 Ye were trampling down
 And on whose account
 A crime would have accrued
 To you without (your) knowledge,
 (God would have allowed you
 To force your way, but
 He held back your hands)
 That He may admit
 To His Mercy whom He will.
 If they had been
 Apart, We should

Certainly have punished
 The Unbelievers among them
 With a grievous punishment.

26. While the Unbelievers
 Got up in their hearts
 Heat and cant--the heat
 And cant of Ignorance,--
 God sent down His Tranquillity
 To his Apostle and to
 The Believers, and made them
 Stick close to the command
 Of self-restraint; and well
 Were they entitled to it
 And worthy of it.
 And God has full knowledge
 Of all things.

  

SECTION 4.

27. Truly did God fulfil
 The vision for His Apostle:
 Ye shall enter the Sacred
 Mosque, if God wills,
 With minds secure, heads shaved,
 Hair cut short, and without fear.
 For He knew what ye
 Knew not, and He granted,
 Besides this, a speedy victory.

28. It is He Who has sent
 His Apostle with Guidance
 And the Religion of Truth,
 To proclaim it over

All religion: and enough
 Is God for a Witness.

29. Muhammad is the Apostle
 Of God; and those who are
 With him are strong
 Against Unbelievers, (but)
 Compassionate amongst each other.
 Thou wilt see them bow
 And prostrate themselves
 (In prayer), seeking Grace
 From God and (His) Good
 Pleasure.
 On their faces are their
 Marks, (being) the traces
 Of their prostration.
 This is their similitude
 In the Taurat;
 And their similitude
 In the Gospel is:
 Like a seed which sends
 Forth its blade, then
 Makes it strong; it then
 Becomes thick, and it stands

On its own stem, (filling)
 The sowers with wonder
 And delight. As a result,
 It fills the Unbelievers
 With rage at them.
 God has promised those
 Among them who believe
 And do righteous deeds
 Forgiveness,
 And a great Reward.



  

Sura XLIX.

  

Hujurat, or the Inner Apartments.



1. O ye who believe!
 Put not yourselves forward
 Before God and His Apostle;
 But fear God: for God
 Is He Who hears
 And knows all things.

2. O ye who believe!
 Raise not your voices!
 Above the voice of the Prophet,
 Nor speak aloud to him
 In talk, as ye may
 Speak aloud to one another,
 Lest your deeds become!
 Vain and ye perceive not.

3. Those that lower their voice
 In the presence of
 God's Apostle,--their hearts
 Has God tested for piety:
 For them is Forgiveness
 And a great Reward.

4. Those who shout out
 To thee from without

The Inner Apartments--
 Most of them lack understanding.

5. If only they had patience
 Until thou couldst
 Come out to them,
 It would be best
 For them: but God is
 Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

6. O ye who believe!
 If a wicked person comes
 To you with any news,
 Ascertain the truth, lest
 Ye harm people unwittingly,
 And afterwards become
 Full of repentance for
 What ye have done.

7. And know that among you
 Is God's Apostle: were he,
 In many matters, to follow
 Your (wishes), ye would
 Certainly fall into misfortune:
 But God has endeared
 The Faith to you, and
 Has made it beautiful
 In your hearts, and He
 Has made hateful to you
 Unbelief, wickedness, and
 Rebellion: such indeed are
 Those who walk in righteousness;--

8. A grace and favour
 From God; and God
 Is full of Knowledge
 And Wisdom.

9. If two parties among
 The Believers fall into
 A quarrel, make ye peace
 Between them: but if
 One of them transgresses
 Beyond bounds against the other,
 Then fight ye (all) against
 The one that transgresses
 Until it complies with
 The command of God;
 But if it complies, then
 Make peace between them
 With justice, and be fair:
 For God loves those
 Who are fair (and just).

10. The Believers are but
 A single Brotherhood:
 So make peace and
 Reconciliation between your
 Two (contending) brothers;
 And fear God, that ye
 May receive Mercy.

  

SECTION 2.

11. O ye who believe!
 Let not some men
 Among you laugh at others:
 It may be that
 The (latter) are better
 Than the (former):
 Nor let some women
 Laugh at others:

It may be that
 The (latter) are better
 Than the (former):
 Nor defame nor be
 Sarcastic to each other,
 Nor call each other
 By (offensive) nicknames:
 Ill-seeming is a name
 Connoting wickedness,
 (To be used of one)
 After he has believed:
 And those who
 Do not desist are
 (Indeed) doing wrong.

12. O ye who believe!
 Avoid suspicion as much
 (As possible): for suspicion
 In some cases is a sin:
 And spy not on each other,
 Nor speak ill of each other
 Behind their backs. Would any
 Of you like to eat
 The flesh of his dead
 Brother? Nay, ye would
 Abhor it... But fear God:
 For God is Oft-Returning,
 Most Merciful.

13. O mankind! We created
 You from a single (pair)
 Of a male and a female,
 And made you into
 Nations and tribes, that
 Ye may know each other
 (Not that ye may despise
 (Each other). Verily
 The most honoured of you
 In the sight of God
 Is (he who is) the most
 Righteous of you.
 And God has full knowledge
 And is well acquainted
 (With all things).

14. The desert Arabs say,
 "We believe." Say, ''Ye
 Have no faith; but ye
 (Only) say, "We have submitted
 Our wills to God,"
 For not yet has Faith
 Entered your hearts.
 But if ye obey God
 And His Apostle, He
 Will not belittle aught
 Of your deeds: for God
 Is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."

15. Only those are Believers
 Who have believed in God
 And His Apostle, and have
 Never since doubted, but
 Have striven with their
 Belongings and their persons
 In the Cause of God:
 Such are the sincere ones.

16. Say: "What! Will ye
 Instruct God about your
 Religion? But God knows
 All that is in the heavens
 And on earth: He has
 Full knowledge of all things.

17. They impress on thee
 As favour that they
 Have embraced Islam.
 Say, "Count not your Islam
 As a favour upon me:
 Nay, God has conferred
 A favour upon you
 That He has guided you
 To the Faith, if ye
 Be true and sincere.

18. "Verily God knows
 The secrets of the heavens
 And the earth: and God
 Sees well all
 That ye do."



  

Sura L.

  

Qaf.



1. Qaf.

By the Glorious Qur-an
 (Thou art God's Apostle).

2. But they wonder that
 There has come to them
 A Warner from among
 Themselves.
 So the Unbelievers say:
 "This is a wonderful thing!

3. "What! When we die
 And become dust, (shall we
 Live again?) That is
 A (sort of) Return
 Far (from our understanding)."

4. We already know
 How much of them
 The earth takes away:
 With Us is a Record
 Guarding (the full account).

5. But they deny the truth
 When it comes to them:
 So they are in
 A confused state.

6. Do they not look
 At the sky above them?--
 How We have made it
 And adorned it,
 And there are no
 Flaws in it?

7. And the earth--
 We have spread it out,
 And set thereon mountains
 Standing firm, and produced
 Therein every kind of
 Beautiful growth (in pairs)--

8. To be observed
 And commemorated
 By every devotee
 Turning (to God).

9. And We send down
 From the sky Rain
 Charged with blessing,
 And We produce therewith
 Gardens and Grain for harvests;

10. And tall (and stately)
 Palm-trees, with shoots
 Of fruit-stalks, piled
 One over another;--

11\. As sustenance for
 (God's) Servants;--
 And We give (new) life
 Therewith to land that is
 Dead: thus will be
 The Resurrection.

12. Before them was denied
 (The Hereafter) by the People
 Of Noah, the Companions
 Of the Rass, the Thamud,

13. The 'Ad, Pharaoh,
 The Brethren of Lut,

14. The Companions of the Wood,
 And the People of Tubba';
 Each one (of them) rejected
 The apostles, and My warning
 Was duly fulfilled (in them).

15. Were We then weary
 With the first Creation,
 That they should be
 In confused doubt
 About a new Creation?

  

SECTION 2.

16. It was We Who
 Created man, and We know
 What dark suggestions his soul
 Makes to him: for We
 Are nearer to him
 Than (his) jugular vein.

17. Behold, two (guardian angels)
 Appointed to learn (his doings)
 Learn (and note them),
 One sitting on the right
 And one on the left.

18. Not a word does he
 Utter but there is
 A sentinel by him,
 Ready (to note it).

19. And the stupor of death
 Will bring truth (before
 His eyes): "This was
 The thing which thou
 Wast trying to escape!"

20. And the Trumpet
 Shall be blown:
 That will be the Day
 Whereof Warning (had been given).

21. And there will come forth
 Every soul: with each
 Will be an (angel) to drive,
 And an (angel) to
 Bear witness.

22. (It will be said:)
 "Thou wast heedless
 Of this; now have We
 Removed thy veil,

And sharp is thy sight
 This Day!"

23. And his Companion will say:
 "Here is (his Record) ready
 With me!"

24. (The sentence will be:)
 "Throw, throw into Hell
 Every contumacious Rejecter
 (Of God)!--

25. "Who forbade what was good,
 Transgressed all bounds,
 Cast doubts and suspicions;

26. "Who set up another god
 Beside God: throw him
 Into a severe Penalty."

27. His Companion will say:
 "Our Lord! I did not
 Make him transgress,
 But he was (himself)
 Far astray."

28. He will say: "Dispute not
 With each other
 In My Presence:
 I had already in advance
 Sent you Warning.

29. "The Word changes not
 Before Me, and I do not
 The least injustice
 To My Servants."

  

SECTION 3.

30. One Day We will
 Ask Hell, "Art thou
 Filled to the full?"
 It will say, "Are there
 Any more (to come)?"

31. And the Garden
 Will be brought nigh

To the Righteous,--no more
 A thing distant.

32. (A voice will say:)
 "This is what was
 Promised for you,
 For every one who turned
 (To God) in sincere repentance,
 Who kept (His Law),

33. "Who feared (God)
 Most Gracious unseen,
 And brought a heart
 Turned in devotion (to Him):

34. "Enter ye therein
 In Peace and Security;
 This is a Day
 Of Eternal Life!"

35. There will be for them
 Therein all that they wish,--
 And more besides
 In Our Presence,

36. But how many
 Generations before them
 Did We destroy (for their
 Sins),--stronger in power
 Than they? Then did they
 Wander through the land:
 Was there any place
 Of escape (for them)?

37. Verily in this
 Is a Message
 For any that has
 A heart and understanding
 Or who gives ear and
 Earnestly witnesses (the truth).

38. We created the heavens
 And the earth and all
 Between them in Six Days,
 Nor did any sense
 Of weariness touch Us.

39. Bear, then, with patience,
 All that they say,
 And celebrate the praises
 Of thy Lord, before
 The rising of the sun
 And before (its) setting,

40. And during part
 Of the night, (also,)
 Celebrate His praises,
 And (so likewise)
 After the postures
 Of adoration.

41. And listen for the Day
 When the Caller will call
 Out from a place
 Quite near,--

42. The Day when they will
 Hear a (mighty) Blast
 In (very) truth: that
 Will be the Day
 Of Resurrection.

43. Verily it is We Who
 Give Life and Death;
 And to Us is
 The Final Goal--

44. The Day when
 The Earth will be
 Rent asunder, from (men)
 Hurrying out: that will be
 A gathering together,--
 Quite easy for Us.

45. We know best what they
 Say; and thou art not
 One to overawe them
 By force. So admonish
 With the Qur-an such
 As fear My Warning!



  

Sura LI.

  

Zariyat, or the Winds That Scatter.



1. By the (Winds)
 That scatter broadcast;

2. And those that
 Lift and bear away
 Heavy weights;

3. And those that
 Flow with ease
 And gentleness;

4. And those that
 Distribute and apportion
 By Command;--

5. Verily that which ye
 Are promised is true;

6. And verily Judgment
 And Justice must
 Indeed come to pass.

7. By the Sky
 With (its) numerous Paths,

8. Truly ye are in
 A doctrine discordant,

9. Through which are deluded (away
 From the Truth) such
 As would be deluded.

10. Woe to the falsehood-mongers,--

11. Those who (flounder) heedless
 In a flood of confusion:

12. They ask, "When will be
 The Day of Judgment
 And Justice?"

13. (It will be) a Day
 When they will be tried
 (And tested) over the Fire!

14. "Taste ye your trial!
 This is what ye used
 To ask to be hastened!

15. As to the Righteous,
 They will be in the midst
 Of Gardens and Springs,

16. Taking joy in the things
 Which their Lord gives them,
 Because, before then, they
 Lived a good life.

17. They were in the habit
 Of sleeping but little
 By night,

18. And in the hours
 Of early dawn,

They (were found) praying
 For Forgiveness;

19. And in their wealth
 And possessions (was remembered)
 The right of the (needy,)
 Him who asked, and him
 Who (for some reason) was
 Prevented (from asking).

20. On the earth
 Are Signs for those
 Of assured Faith,

21. As also in your, own
 Selves: will ye not
 Then see?

22. And in heaven is
 Your Sustenance, as (also)
 That which ye are promised.

23. Then, by the Lord
 Of heaven and earth,
 This is the very Truth,
 As much as the fact
 That ye can speak
 Intelligently to each other.

  

SECTION 2.

24. Has the story
 Reached thee, of the honoured
 Guests of Abraham?

25. Behold, they entered
 His presence, and said:
 "Peace!" He said, "Peace"
 (And thought, "These seem)
 Unusual people."

26. Then he turned quickly
 To his household, brought
 Out a fatted calf,

27. And placed it before them...
 He said, "Will ye not
 Eat?"

28. (When they did not eat),
 He conceived a fear of them.
 They said, "Fear not,"
 And they gave him
 Glad tidings of a son
 Endowed with knowledge.

29. But his wife came forward
 (Laughing) aloud: she smote
 Her forehead and said:
 "A barren old woman!"

30. They said, "Even so
 Has thy Lord spoken:
 And He is full
 Of Wisdom and Knowledge."

31. (Abraham) said: "And what,
 O ye Messengers,
 Is your errand (now)?"

32. They said, "We have
 Been sent to a people
 (Deep) in sin;--

33. "To bring on, on them,
 (A shower of) stones
 Of clay (brimstone),

34. "Marked as from thy Lord
 For those who trespass
 Beyond bounds."

35. Then We evacuated
 Those of the Believers
 Who were there,

36. But We found not there
 Any just (Muslim) persons
 Except in one house:

37. And We left there
 A Sign for such as
 Fear the Grievous Penalty.

38. And in Moses
 (Was another Sign):
 Behold, We sent him
 To Pharaoh, with authority
 Manifest.

39. But (Pharaoh) turned back
 With his Chiefs, and said,
 "A sorcerer, or
 One possessed!"

40. So We took him
 And his forces, and
 Threw them into the sea;
 And his was the blame:

41. And in the 'Ad (people)
 (Was another Sign):
 Behold, We sent against them
 The devastating Wind:

42. It left nothing whatever
 That it came up against,
 But reduced it to ruin
 And rottenness.

43. And in the Thamud
 (Was another Sign):
 Behold, they were told,
 "Enjoy (your brief day)
 For a little while!"

44. But they insolently defied
 The Command of their Lord:
 So the stunning noise
 (Of an earthquake) seized
 Them, even while they
 Were looking on.

45. Then they could not
 Even stand (on their feet),
 Nor could they help themselves.

46. So were the People
 Of Noah before them:
 For they wickedly transgressed.

  

SECTION 3.

47. With power and skill
 Did We construct
 The Firmament:
 For it is We Who create
 The vastness of Space.

48. And We have spread out
 The (spacious) earth:
 How excellently
 We do spread out!

49. And of every thing
 We have created pairs
 That ye may receive
 Instruction.

50. Hasten ye then (at once)
 To God: I am from Him
 A Warner to you,
 Clear and open!

51. And make not another
 An object of worship
 With God:
 I am from Him
 A Warner to you,
 Clear and open!

52. Similarly, no apostle came
 To the Peoples before them,
 But they said (of him)
 In like manner,
 "A sorcerer, or
 One possessed"!

53. Is this the legacy
 They have transmitted,

One to another
 Nay, they are themselves
 A people transgressing
 Beyond bounds!

54. So turn away
 From them: not thine
 Is the blame.

55. But teach (thy Message):
 For teaching benefits
 The Believers.

56. I have only created
 Jinns and men, that
 They may serve Me.

57. No Sustenance do I require
 Of them, nor do I
 Require that they should
 Feed Me.

58. For God is He Who
 Gives (all) Sustenance,--
 Lord of Power,--
 Steadfast (for ever).

59. For the wrong-doers,
 Their portion is like

Unto the portion of their
 Fellows (of earlier generations):
 Then let them not ask Me
 To hasten (that portion)!

60. Woe, then, to the Unbelievers,
 On account of that Day
 Of theirs which they
 Have been promised!



  

Sura LII.

  

Tur, or the Mount.



1. By the Mount (of Revelation);

2. By a Decree Inscribed

3. In a Scroll unfolded;

4. By the much-frequented Fane;

5. By the Canopy Raised High;

6. And by the Ocean
 Filled with Swell;--

7. Verily, the Doom of thy Lord
 Will indeed come to pass;--

8. There is none
 Can avert it;--

9. On the Day when
 The firmament will be
 In dreadful commotion.

10. And the mountains will fly
 Hither and thither.

11. Then woe that Day
 To those that treat
 (Truth) as Falsehood;--

12. That play (and paddle)
 In shallow trifles.

13. That Day shall they be
 Thrust down to the Fire
 Of Hell, irresistibly.

14. "This", it will be said,
 "Is the Fire,--which ye
 Were wont to deny!

15. "Is this then a fake,
 Or is it ye that
 Do not see?

16. "Burn ye therein:
 The same is it to you
 Whether ye bear it
 With patience, or not:
 Ye but receive the recompense
 Of your (own) deeds."

17. As to the Righteous,
 They will be in Gardens,
 And in Happiness,--

18. Enjoying the (Bliss) which
 Their Lord hath bestowed
 On them, and their Lord
 Shall deliver them from
 The Penalty of the Fire.

19. (To them will be said:)
 "Eat and drink ye,
 With profit and health,
 Because of your (good) deeds."

20. They will recline (with ease)
 On Thrones (of dignity)
 Arranged in ranks;
 And We shall join them
 To Companions, with beautiful
 Big and lustrous eyes.

21. And those who believe
 And whose families follow
 Them in Faith,-- to them
 Shall We join their families:
 Nor shall We deprive them
 (Of the fruit) of aught
 Of their works:
 (Yet) is each individual
 In pledge for his deeds.

22. And We shall bestow
 On them, of fruit and meat,
 Anything they shall desire.

23. They shall there exchange,
 One with another,
 A (loving) cup
 Free of frivolity,
 Free of all taint
 Of ill.

24. Round about them will serve,
 (Devoted) to them,
 Youths (handsome) as Pearls
 Well-guarded.

25. They will advance
 To each other, engaging
 In mutual enquiry.

26. They will say: "Aforetime,
 We were not without fear
 For the sake of our people.

27. "But God has been good
 To us, and has delivered us
 From the Penalty
 Of the Scorching Wind.

28. "Truly, we did call
 Unto Him from of old:
 Truly it is He,
 The Beneficent, the Merciful!

  

SECTION 2.

29. Wherefore proclaim thou
 The praises (of thy Lord):
 For by the Grace
 Of thy Lord, thou art
 No (vulgar) soothsayer, nor
 Art thou one possessed.

30. Or do they say:--
 "A Poet! we await
 For him some calamity
 (Hatched) by Time!"

31. Say thou: "Await ye!--
 I too will wait
 Along with you!"

32. Is it that their faculties
 Of understanding urge them
 To this, or are they
 But a people transgressing
 Beyond bounds?

33. Or do they say,
 "He fabricated the (Message)"?
 Nay, they have no faith!

34. Let them then produce
 A recital like unto it,--
 If (it be) they speak
 The Truth!

35. Were they created of
 nothing,
 Or were they themselves
 The creators?

36. Or did they create
 The heavens and the earth?
 Nay, they have
 No firm belief.

37. Or are the Treasures
 Of thy Lord with them,
 Or are they the managers
 (Of affairs)?

38. Or have they a ladder,
 By which they can (climb
 Up to heaven and) listen
 (To its secrets)? Then let
 (Such a) listener of theirs
 Produce a manifest proof.

39. Or has He only daughters
 And ye have sons?

40. Or is it that thou
 Dost ask for a reward,
 So that they are burdened
 With a load of debt?--

41. Or that the Unseen
 Is in their hands,
 And they write it down?

42. Or do they intend
 A plot (against thee)?
 But those who defy God
 Are themselves involved
 In a Plot!

43. Or have they a god
 Other than God?
 Exalted is God
 Far above the things
 They associate with Him!

44. Were they to see
 A piece of the sky
 Falling (on them), they
 Would (only) say: "Clouds
 Gathered in heaps!"

45. So leave them alone
 Until they encounter
 That Day of theirs,
 Wherein they shall (perforce)
 Swoon (with terror),--

46. The Day when their plotting
 Will avail them nothing
 And no help shall be
 Given them.

47. And verily, for those
 Who do wrong, there is
 Another punishment besides this:
 But most of them
 Understand not.

48. Now await in patience
 The command of thy Lord:

For verily thou art
 In Our eyes:
 And celebrate the praises
 Of thy Lord the while
 Thou standest forth,

49. And for part of the night
 Also praise thou Him,--
 And at the retreat
 Of the stars!



  

Sura LIII.

  

Najm, or the Star.



1. By the Star
 When it goes down,--

2. Your Companion is neither
 Astray nor being misled,

3. Nor does he say (aught)
 Of (his own) Desire.

4. It is no less than
 Inspiration sent down to him:

5. He was taught by one
 Mighty in Power,

6. Endued with Wisdom:
 For he appeared
 (In stately form)

7. While he was in
 The highest part
 Of the horizon:

8. Then he approached
 And came closer,

9. And was at a distance
 Of but two bow-lengths
 Or (even) nearer;

10. So did (God) convey
 The inspiration to His Servant--
 (Conveyed) what He (meant)
 To convey.

11. The (Prophet's) (mind and) heart
 In no way falsified
 That which he saw.

12. Will ye then dispute
 With him concerning
 What he saw?

13. For indeed he saw him
 At a second descent,

14. Near the Lote-tree
 Beyond which none may pass:

15. Near it is the Garden
 Of Abode.

16. Behold, the Lote-tree
 Was shrouded
 (In mystery unspeakable!)

17. (His) sight never swerved,
 Nor did it go wrong!

18. For truly did he see,
 Of the Signs of his Lord,
 The Greatest!

19. Have ye seen
 Lat, and 'Uzza,

20. And another,
 The third (goddess), Manat?

21. What! For you
 The male sex,
 And for Him, the female?

22. Behold, such would be
 Indeed a division
 Most unfair!

23. These are nothing but names
 Which ye have devised,--
 Ye and your fathers,
 For which God has sent
 Down no authority (whatever).
 They follow nothing but
 Conjecture and what
 Their own souls desire!--
 Even though there has already
 Come to them Guidance
 From their Lord!

24. Nay, shall man have (just)
 Anything he hankers after?

25. But it is to God
 That the End and
 The Beginning (of all things)
 Belong.

  

SECTION 2.

26. How many-so-ever be
 The angels in the heavens,
 Their intercession will avail nothing
 Except after God has given
 Leave for whom He pleases
 And that he is acceptable
 To Him.

27. Those who believe not
 In the Hereafter, name
 The angels with female names.

28. But they have no knowledge
 Therein. They follow nothing
 But conjecture; and conjecture
 Avails nothing against Truth.

29. Therefore shun those who
 Turn away from Our Message
 And desire nothing but
 The life of this world.

30. That is as far as
 Knowledge will reach them.
 Verily thy Lord knoweth best
 Those who stray from
 His Path, and He knoweth
 Best those who receive guidance.

31. Yea, to God belongs all
 That is in the heavens
 And on earth: so that
 He rewards those who do
 Evil, according to their deeds,
 And He rewards those who
 Do good, with what is best.

32. Those who avoid
 Great sins and shameful deeds,

Only (falling into) small faults,
 Verily thy Lord is ample
 In forgiveness. He knows
 You well when He brings
 You out of the earth,
 And when ye are hidden
 In your mothers' wombs.
 Therefore justify not yourselves;
 He knows best who it is
 That guards against evil.

  

SECTION 3.

33. Seest thou one
 Who turns back,

34. Gives a little,
 Then hardens (his heart)?

35. What! Has he knowledge
 Of the unseen
 So that he can see?

36. Nay, is he not acquainted
 With what is in the books
 Of Moses--

37. And of Abraham
 Who fulfilled his
 engagements;--

38. Namely, that no bearer
 Of burdens can bear
 The burden of another;

39. That man can have nothing
 But what he strives for;

40. That (the fruit of) his striving
 Will soon come in sight;

41. Then will he be rewarded
 With a reward complete;

42. That to thy Lord
 Is the final Goal;

43. That it is He Who
 Granteth Laughter and Tears;

44. That it is He Who
 Granteth Death and Life;

45. That He did create
 In pairs,--male and female,

46. From a seed when lodged
 (In its place);

47. That He hath promised
 A Second Creation
 (Raising of the Dead);

48. That it is He Who
 Giveth wealth and satisfaction;

49. That He is the Lord
 Of Sirius (the Mighty Star);

50. And that it is He
 Who destroyed the (powerful)
 Ancient 'Ad (people),

51. And the Thamud,
 Nor gave them a lease
 Of perpetual life.

52. And before them,
 The people of Noah,
 For that they were (all)
 Most unjust
 And most insolent transgressors,

53. And He destroyed
 The Overthrown Cities
 (Of Sodom and Gomorrah),

54. So that (ruins unknown)
 Have covered them up.

55. Then which of the gifts
 Of thy Lord, (O man,)
 Wilt thou dispute about?

56. This is a Warner,
 Of the (series of) Warners
 Of old!

57. The (Judgment) ever approaching
 Draws nigh:

58. No (soul) but God
 Can lay it bare.

59. Do ye then wonder
 At this recital?

60. And will ye laugh
 And not weep,--

61. Wasting your time
 In vanities?

62. But fall ye down in prostration
 To God, and adore (Him)!



  

Sura LIV.

  

Qamar, or the Moon.


1. The Hour (of Judgment)
 Is nigh, and the moon
 Is cleft asunder.

2. But if they see
 A Sign, they turn away,
 And say, "This is
 (But) transient magic."

3. They reject (the warning)
 And follow their (own) lusts
 But every matter has
 Its appointed time.

4. There have already come
 To them Recitals wherein
 There is (enough) to check (them),

5. Mature wisdom;--but
 (The preaching of) Warners
 Profits them not.

6. Therefore, (O Prophet,)
 Turn away from them.
 The Day that the Caller
 Will call (them)
 To a terrible affair,

7. They will come forth,
 Their eyes humbled--
 From (their) graves, (torpid)
 Like locusts scattered abroad,

8. Hastening, with eyes transfixed,
 Towards the Caller!--
 "Hard is this Day!",
 The Unbelievers will say.

9. Before them the People
 Of Noah rejected (their apostle):
 They rejected Our servant,
 And said, "Here is
 One possessed!", and he
 Was driven out.

10. Then he called on his Lord:
 "I am one overcome:
 Do Thou then help (me)!

11. So We opened the gates
 Of heaven, with water
 Pouring forth.

12. And We caused the earth
 To gush forth with springs.
 So the waters met (and rose)
 To the extent decreed.

13. But We bore him
 On an (Ark) made of
 Broad planks and caulked
 With palm-fibre:

14. She floats under our eyes
 (And care): a recompense
 To one who had been
 Rejected (with scorn)!

15. And We have left
 This as a Sign
 (For all time): then
 Is there any that will
 Receive admonition?

16. But how (terrible) was
 My Penalty and My Warning?

17. And We have indeed
 Made the Qur-an easy

To understand and remember:
 Then is there any that
 Will receive admonition?

18. The 'Ad (people) (too)
 Rejected (Truth): then
 How terrible was
 My Penalty and My Warning?

19. For We sent against them
 A furious wind, on a Day
 Of violent Disaster,

20. Plucking out men as if
 They were roots of palm-trees
 Torn up (from the ground).

21. Yea, how (terrible) was
 My Penalty and My Warning!

22. But We have indeed
 Made the Qur-an easy
 To understand and remember:
 Then is there any that
 Will receive admonition?

  

SECTION 2.

23. The Thamud (also)
 Rejected (their) Warners.

24. For they said: "What!
 A man! a solitary one

From among ourselves!
 Shall we follow such a one?
 Truly should we then be
 Straying in mind, and mad!

25. "Is it that the Message
 Is sent to him,
 Of all people amongst us?
 Nay, he is a liar,
 An insolent one!"

26. Ah! they will know
 On the morrow, which is
 The liar, the insolent one!

27. For We will send
 The she-camel
 By way of trial for them.
 So watch them, (O Salih),
 And possess thyself in patience!

28. And tell them that
 The water is to be
 Divided between them:
 Each one's right to drink
 Being brought forward
 (By suitable turns).

29. But they called
 To their companion,
 And he took a sword
 In hand, and hamstrung (her).

30. Ah! how (terrible) was
 My Penalty and My Warning!

31. For We sent against them
 A single Mighty Blast,
 And they became
 Like the dry stubble used
 By one who pens cattle.

32. And we have indeed
 Made the Qur-an easy
 To understand and remember:
 Then is there any that
 Will receive admonition?

33. The People of Lut
 Rejected (his) Warning.

34. We sent against them
 A violent tornado
 With showers of stones,
 (Which destroyed them), except
 Lut's household: them We
 Delivered by early Dawn,--

35. As a Grace from Us:
 Thus do We reward
 Those who give thanks.

36. And (Lut) did warn them
 Of Our Punishment, but
 They disputed about the Warning.

37. And they even sought
 To snatch away his guests
 From him, but We blinded
 Their eyes. (They heard:)
 "Now taste ye My Wrath
 And My Warning."

38. Early on the morrow
 An abiding Punishment
 Seized them:

39. "So taste ye My Wrath
 And My Warning."

40. And We have indeed
 Made the Qur-an easy
 To understand and remember:
 Then is there any that
 Will receive admonition?

  

SECTION 3.

41. To the People
 Of Pharaoh, too, aforetime,
 Came Warners (from God).

42. The (people) rejected all
 Our Signs; but We
 Seized them with such Penalty
 (As comes) from One
 Exalted in Power,
 Able to carry out His Will.

43. Are your Unbelievers,
 (O Quraish), better than they?
 Or have ye an immunity
 In the Sacred Books?

44. Or do they say:
 "We acting together
 Can defend ourselves"?

45. Soon will their multitude
 Be put to flight,
 And they will show
 Their backs.

46. Nay, the Hour (of Judgment)
 Is the time promised them
 (For their full recompense):
 And that Hour will be
 Most grievous and most bitter.

47. Truly those in sin
 Are the ones
 Straying in mind, and mad.

48. The Day they will be
 Dragged through the Fire
 On their faces, (they
 Will hear:) "Taste ye
 The touch of Hell!"

49. Verily, all things
 Have We created
 In proportion and measure.

50. And Our Command
 Is but a single (Act),--
 Like the twinkling
 Of an eye.

51. And (oft) in the past,
 Have We destroyed gangs
 Like unto you: then
 Is there any that
 Will receive admonition?

52. All that they do
 Is noted in (their)
 Books (of Deeds):

53. Every matter, small and great,
 Is on record.

54. As to the Righteous,
 They will be in the midst
 Of Gardens and Rivers,

55. In an Assembly of Truth,
 In the Presence of
 A Sovereign Omnipotent.



  

Sura LV.

  

Rahman, or (God) Most Gracious.



1. (God) Most Gracious!

2. It is He Who has
 Taught the Qur-an.

3. He has created man:

4. He has taught him speech
 (And Intelligence).

5. The sun and the moon
 Follow courses (exactly) computed;

6. And the herbs and the trees--
 Both (alike) bow in adoration.

7. And the Firmament has He
 Raised high, and He has set up
 The Balance (of Justice),

8. In order that ye may
 Not transgress (due) balance.

9. So establish weight with justice
 And fall not short
 In the balance.

10. It is He Who has
 Spread out the earth
 For (His) creatures:

11. Therein is fruit
 And date-palms, producing
 Spathes (enclosing dates);

12. Also corn, with (its)
 Leaves and stalk for fodder,
 And sweet-smelling plants.

13. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?

14. He created man
 From sounding clay
 Like unto pottery,

15. And He created Jinns
 From fire free of smoke:

16. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?

17. (He is) Lord
 Of the two Easts
 And Lord
 Of the two Wests:

18. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?

19. He has let free
 The two bodies
 Of flowing water,
 Meeting together:

20. Between them is a Barrier
 Which they do not transgress:

21. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?

22. Out of them come
 Pearls and Coral:

23. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?

24. And His are the Ships
 Sailing smoothly through the seas,
 Lofty as mountains:

25. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?

  

SECTION 2.

26. All that is on earth
 Will perish:

27. But will abide (for ever)
 The Face of thy Lord,--

Full of Majesty,
 Bounty and Honour.

28. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?

29. Of Him seeks (its need)
 Every creature in the heavens
 And on earth:
 Every day in (new) Splendour
 Doth He (shine)!

30. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?

31. Soon shall We
 Settle your affairs,
 O both ye worlds!

32. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?

33. O ye assembly of Jinns,
 And men! If it be

Ye can pass beyond
 The zones of the heavens
 And the earth, pass ye!
 Not without authority
 Shall ye be able to pass!

34. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?

35. On you will be sent
 (O ye evil ones twain!)
 A flame of fire (to burn)
 And a smoke (to choke):
 No defence will ye have:

36. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?

37. When the sky is rent
 Asunder, and it becomes red
 Like ointment:

38. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?

39. On that Day
 No question will be asked
 Of man or Jinn
 As to his sin,

40. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?

41. (For) the sinners will be
 Known by their Marks:
 And they will be seized
 By their forelocks and
 Their feet.

42. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?

43. This is the Hell which
 The Sinners deny:

44. In its midst
 And in the midst
 Of boiling hot water
 Will they wander round!

45. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?

  

SECTION 3.

46. But for such as fear
 The time when they will
 Stand before (the Judgment Seat
 Of) their Lord,
 There will be two Gardens--

47. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?--

48. Containing all kinds
 (Of trees and delights);--

49. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?--

50. In them (each) will be
 Two Springs flowing (free);

51. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?--

52. In them will be Fruits
 Of every kind, two and two.

53. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?

54. They will recline on Carpets,
 Whose inner linings will be
 Of rich brocade: the Fruit
 Of the Gardens will be
 Near (and easy of reach).

55. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?

56. In them will be (Maidens),
 Chaste, restraining their glances,
 Whom no man or Jinn
 Before them has touched;--

57. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?--

58. Like unto rubies and coral.

59. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?

60. Is there any Reward
 For Good-other than Good?

61. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?

62. And besides these two,
 There are two other Gardens,--

63. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?--

64. Dark-green in colour
 (From plentiful watering).

65. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?

66. In them (each) will be
 Two Springs pouring forth water
 In continuous abundance:

67. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?

68. In them will be Fruits,
 And dates and pomegranates:

69. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?

70. In them will be
 Fair (Companions), good,
 beautiful;--

71. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?--

72. Companions restrained (as to
 Their glances), in (goodly)
 pavilions;--

73. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?--

74. Whom no man or Jinn
 Before them has touched;--

75. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?--

76. Reclining on green Cushions
 And rich Carpets of beauty.

77. Then which of the favours
 Of your Lord will ye deny?

78. Blessed be the name
 Of thy Lord,
 Full of Majesty,
 Bounty and Honour.



  

Sura LVI.

  

Waqi'a, or The Inevitable Event.



1. When the Event Inevitable
 Cometh to pass,

2. Then will no (soul)
 Entertain falsehood
 Concerning its coming.

3. (Many) will it bring low;
 (Many) will it exalt;

4. When the earth shall be
 Shaken to its depths,

5. And the mountains shall
 Be crumbled to atoms,

6. Becoming dust scattered abroad,

7. And ye shall be sorted out
 Into three classes.

8. Then (there will be)
 The Companions of
 The Right Hand;--
 What will be
 The Companions of
 The Right Hand?

9. And the Companions of
 The Left Hand,--
 What will be
 The Companions of
 The Left Hand?

10. And those Foremost
 (In Faith) will be
 Foremost (in the Hereafter).

11. These will be
 Those Nearest to God:

12. In Gardens of Bliss:

13. A number of people
 From those of old,

14. And a few from those
 Of later times.

15. (They will be) on Thrones
 Encrusted (with gold
 And precious stones),

16. Reclining on them,
 Facing each other.

17. Round about them will (serve)
 Youths of perpetual (freshness),

18. With goblets, (shining) beakers,
 And cups (filled) out of
 Clear-flowing fountains:

19. No after-ache will they
 Receive therefrom, nor will they
 Suffer intoxication:

20. And with fruits,
 Any that they may select;

21. And the flesh of fowls,
 Any that they may desire.

22. And (there will be) Companions
 With beautiful, big,
 And lustrous eyes,--

23. Like unto Pearls
 Well-guarded.

24. A Reward for the Deeds
 Of their past (Life).

25. No frivolity will they
 Hear therein, nor any
 Taint of ill,--

26. Only the saying,
 "Peace! Peace".

27. The Companions of
 The Right Hand,--
 What will be
 The Companions of
 The Right Hand?

28. (They will be) among
 Lote-trees without thorns,

29. Among Talh trees
 With flowers (or fruits)
 Piled one above another,--

30. In shade long-extended,

31. By water flowing constantly,

32. And fruit in abundance.

33. Whose season is not limited,
 Nor (supply) forbidden,

34. And on Thrones (of Dignity),
 Raised high.

35. We have created
 (their Companions)
 Of special creation.

36. And made them
 Virgin-pure (and undefiled),--

37. Beloved (by nature),
 Equal in age,--

38. For the Companions
 Of the Right Hand.

  

SECTION 2.

39. A (goodly) number
 From those of old,

40. And a (goodly) number
 From those of later times.

41. The Companions of
 The Left Hand,--
 What will be
 The Companions of
 The Left Hand?

42. (They will be) in the midst
 Of a fierce Blast of Fire
 And in Boiling Water,

43. And in the shades
 Of Black Smoke:

44. Nothing (will there be)
 To refresh, nor to please:

45. For that they were wont
 To be indulged, before that,

In wealth (and luxury),

46. And persisted obstinately
 In wickedness supreme!

47. And they used to say,
 "What! when we die
 And become dust and bones,
 Shall we then indeed
 Be raised up again?--

48. "(We) and our fathers of old?"

49. Say: "Yea, those of old
 And those of later times,

50. "All will certainly be
 Gathered together for the meeting
 Appointed for a Day
 Well-known.

51. "Then will ye truly,--
 O ye that go wrong,
 And treat (Truth) as Falsehood!--

52. "Ye will surely taste
 Of the Tree of Zaqqum.

53. "Then will ye fill
 Your insides therewith,

54. "And drink Boiling Water
 On top of it:

55. "Indeed ye shall drink
 Like diseased camels
 Raging with thirst!"

56. Such will be their entertainment
 On the Day of Requital!

57. It is We Who have
 Created you: why will ye
 Not witness the Truth?

58. Do ye then see?--
 The (human Seed) that
 Ye throw out,--

59. Is it ye who create it,
 Or are We the Creators?

60. We have decreed Death
 To be your common lot,
 And We are not
 To be frustrated

61. From changing your Forms
 And creating you (again)
 In (Forms) that ye know not.

62. And ye certainly know already
 The first form of creation:
 Why then do ye not
 Celebrate His praises?

63. See ye the seed that
 Ye sow in the ground?

64. Is it ye that cause it
 To grow, or are We
 The Cause?

65. Were it Our Will,
 We could crumble it
 To dry powder, and ye would
 Be left in wonderment,

66. (Saying), "We are indeed
 Left with debts (for nothing):

67. "Indeed are we shut out
 (Of the fruits of our labour)",

68. See ye the water
 Which ye drink?

69. Do ye bring it Down
 (In rain) from the Cloud
 Or do We?

70. Were it Our Will,
 We could make it

Salt (and unpalatable):
 Then why do ye not
 Give thanks?

71. See ye the Fire
 Which ye kindle?

72. Is it ye who grow
 The tree which feeds
 The fire, or do We
 Grow it?

73. We have made it
 A memorial (of Our handiwork),
 And an article of comfort
 And convenience for
 The denizens of deserts.

74. Then celebrate with praises,
 The name of thy Lord,
 The Supreme!

  

SECTION 3.

75. Furthermore I call
 To witness the setting
 Of the Stars,--

76. And that is indeed
 A mighty adjuration
 If ye but knew,--

77. That this is indeed
 A Qur-an most honourable,

78. In a Book well-guarded,

79. Which none shall touch
 But those who are clean:

80. A Revelation from the Lord
 Of the Worlds.

81. Is it such a Message
 That ye would hold
 In light esteem?

82. And have ye made it
 Your livelihood that ye
 Should declare it false?

83. Then why do ye not
 (Intervene) when (the soul
 Of the dying man)
 Reaches the throat,--

84. And ye the while
 (Sit) looking on,--

85. But We are nearer
 To him than ye,
 And yet see not,--

86. Then why do ye not,--
 If you are exempt
 From (future) account,--

87. Call back the soul,
 If ye are true
 (In your claim of Independence)?

88. Thus, then, if he
 Be of those Nearest to God,

89. (There is for him) Rest
 And Satisfaction, and
 A Garden of Delights.

90. And if he be
 Of the Companions of
 The Right Hand,

91. (For him is the salutation),
 "Peace be unto thee",
 From the Companions
 Of the Right Hand.

92. And if he be
 Of those who treat
 (Truth) as Falsehood,
 Who go wrong,

93. For him is Entertainment
 With Boiling Water,

94. And burning in Hell-Fire.

95. Verily, this is
 The Very Truth
 And Certainty.

96. So celebrate with praises
 The name of thy Lord,
 The Supreme.



  

Sura LVII.

  

Hadid, or Iron.



1. Whatever is in
 The heavens and on earth,--
 Let it declare
 The Praises and Glory of God:
 For He is the Exalted
 In Might, the Wise.

2. To Him belongs the dominion
 Of the heavens and the earth:
 It is He Who gives
 Life and Death; and He
 Has Power over all things.

3. He is the First
 And the Last,
 The Evident
 And the Immanent:
 And He has full knowledge
 Of all things.

4. He it is Who created
 The heavens and the earth
 In six Days, and is moreover
 Firmly established on the Throne
 (Of authority). He knows
 What enters within the earth

And what comes forth out
 Of it, what comes down
 From heaven and what mounts
 Up to it. And He is
 With you wheresoever ye
 May be. And God sees
 Well all that ye do.

5. To Him belongs the dominion
 Of the heavens and the earth:
 And all affairs are
 Referred back to God.

6. He merges Night into Day,
 And He merges Day into Night;
 And He has full knowledge
 Of the secrets of (all) hearts.

7. Believe in God
 And His Apostle,
 And spend (in charity)
 Out of the (substance)
 Whereof He has made you
 Heirs. For, those of you
 Who believe and spend
 (In charity),--for them
 Is a great Reward.

8. What cause have ye
 Why ye should not believe
 In God?--And the Apostle
 Invites you to believe

In your Lord, and has
 Indeed taken your Covenant,
 If ye are men of faith.

9. He is the One Who
 Sends to His Servant
 Manifest Signs, that He
 May lead you from
 The depths of Darkness
 Into the Light And verily,
 God is to you
 Most kind and Merciful.

10. And what cause have ye
 Why ye should not spend
 In the cause of God?--
 For to God belongs
 The heritage of the heavens
 And the earth.
 Not equal among you
 Are those who spent (freely)
 And fought, before the Victory,
 (With those who did so later).
 Those are higher in rank
 Than those who spent (freely)
 And fought afterwards.
 But to all has God promised
 A goodly (reward). And God
 Is well acquainted
 With all that ye do.

  

SECTION 2.

11. Who is he that will
 Loan to God a beautiful
 Loan? For (God) will
 Increase it manifold
 To his credit,
 And he will have (besides)
 A liberal reward.

12. One Day shalt thou see
 The believing men and
 The believing women--
 How their Light runs
 Forward before them
 And by their right hands:
 (Their greeting will be):
 "Good News for you this Day!
 Gardens beneath which How rivers!
 To dwell therein for aye!
 This is indeed
 The highest Achievement!

13. One Day will the Hypocrites
 Men and women--say
 To the Believers: "Wait
 For us! Let us borrow
 (A light) from your Light!"
 It will be said: "Turn
 Ye back to your rear!
 Then seek a light (where
 Ye can)!" So a wall
 Will be put up betwixt them,

With a gate therein.
 Within it will be Mercy
 Throughout, and without it,
 All alongside, will be
 (Wrath and) Punishment!

14. (Those without) will call out,
 "Were we not with you?
 (The others) will reply, "True!
 But ye led yourselves
 Into temptation; ye looked forward
 (To our ruin); ye doubted
 (God's Promise); and (your false)
 Desires deceived you; until
 There issued the Command
 Of God. And the Deceiver
 Deceived you in respect of God.

15. "This Day shall no ransom
 Be accepted of you, nor
 Of those who rejected God.
 Your abode is the Fire:
 That is the proper place .
 To claim you: and an evil
 Refuge it is!"

16. Has not the time arrived
 For the Believers that
 Their hearts in all humility
 Should engage in the remembrance

Of God and of the Truth
 Which has been revealed (to them),
 And that they should not
 Become like those to whom
 Was given Revelation aforetime,
 But long ages passed over them
 And their hearts grew hard?
 For many among them
 Are rebellious transgressors.

17. Know ye (all) that
 God giveth life
 To the earth after its death
 Already have We shown
 The Signs plainly to you,
 That ye may learn wisdom.

18. For those who give
 In Charity, men and women,
 And loan to God
 A Beautiful Loan,
 It shall be increased manifold
 (To their credit),
 And they shall have (besides)
 A liberal reward.

19. And those who believe
 In God and His apostles--
 They are the Sincere
 (Lovers of Truth), and

The Witnesses (who testify),
 In the eyes of their Lord:
 They shall have their Reward
 And their Light,
 But those who reject God
 And deny Our Signs,--
 They are the Companions
 Of Hell-Fire.

  

SECTION 3.

20. Know ye (all), that
 The life of this world
 Is but play and amusement,
 Pomp and mutual boasting
 And multiplying, (in rivalry)
 Among yourselves, riches
 And children.
 Here is a similitude:
 How rain and the growth
 Which it brings forth, delight
 (The hearts of) the tillers;
 Soon it withers; thou
 Wilt see it grow yellow;
 Then it becomes dry
 And crumbles away.
 But in the Hereafter
 Is a Penalty severe
 (For the devotees of wrong).
 And Forgiveness from God
 And (His) Good Pleasure

(For the devotees of God).
 And what is the life
 Of this world, but
 Goods and chattels
 Of deception?

21. Be ye foremost (in seeking)
 Forgiveness from your Lord,
 And a Garden (of Bliss),
 The width whereof is
 As the width of
 Heaven and earth,
 Prepared for those who believe
 In God and His apostles:
 That is the Grace of God,
 Which He bestows on whom
 He pleases: and God is
 The Lord of Grace abounding.

22. No misfortune can happen
 On earth or in your souls
 But is recorded in
 A decree before We bring
 It into existence:
 That is truly easy for God:

23. In order that ye may
 Not despair over matters
 That pass you by,
 Nor exult over favours
 Bestowed upon you.
 For God loveth not

Any vainglorious boaster,--

24. Such persons as are
 Covetous and commend
 Covetousness to men.
 And if any turn back
 (From God's Way), verily
 God is free of all needs,
 Worthy of all praise.

25. We sent aforetime
 Our apostles with Clear Signs
 And sent down with them
 The Book and the Balance
 (Of Right and Wrong), that men
 May stand forth in justice;
 And We sent down Iron
 In which is (material for)
 Mighty war, as well as
 Many benefits for mankind,
 That God may test who
 It is that will help,

Unseen, Him and His apostles:
 For God is Full of Strength,
 Exalted in Might
 (And able to enforce His Will).

  

SECTION 4.

26. And We sent Noah
 And Abraham, and established
 In their line Prophethood
 And Revelation: and some of them!
 Were on right guidance,
 But many of them
 Became rebellious transgressors.

27. Then, in their wake,
 We followed them up
 With (others of) Our apostles:
 We sent after them
 Jesus the son of Mary,
 And bestowed on him
 The Gospel; and We ordained
 In the hearts of those
 Who followed him
 Compassion and Mercy.

But the Monasticism
 Which they invented
 For themselves, We did not
 Prescribe for them:
 (We commanded) only
 The seeking for the Good
 Pleasure of God; but that
 They did not foster
 As they should have done.
 Yet We bestowed, on those
 Among them who believed,
 Their (due) reward, but
 Many of them are
 Rebellious transgressors.

28. O ye that believe!
 Fear God, and believe
 In His Apostle, and He will
 Bestow on you a double
 Portion of His Mercy:
 He will provide for you

A Light by which ye
 Shall walk (straight
 In your path), and He
 Will forgive you (your past):
 For God is Oft-Forgiving,
 Most Merciful:

29. That the People of
 The Book may know
 That they have no power
 Whatever over the Grace
 Of God, that (His) Grace
 Is (entirely) in his hand,
 To bestow it on
 Whomsoever He wills.
 For God is the Lord.
 Of Grace abounding.



  

Sura LVIII.

  

Mujadila, or The Woman who Pleads.



1. God has indeed
 Heard (and accepted) the statement
 Of the woman who pleads
 With thee concerning her husband
 And carries her complaint
 (In prayer) to God:
 And God (always) hears
 The arguments between both
 Sides among you: for God
 Hears and sees (all things).

2. If any men among you
 Divorce their wives by
 (Calling them mothers),
 They cannot be their mothers:
 None can be their mothers
 Except those who gave them
 Birth. And in fact
 They use words (both) iniquitous
 And false: but truly
 God is One that blots out

(Sins), and forgives
 (Again and again).

3. But those who divorce
 Their wives by Zihar,
 Then wish to go back
 On the words they uttered,--
 (It is ordained that
 Such a one)
 Should free a slave
 Before they touch each other:
 This are ye admonished
 To perform: and God is
 Well-acquainted with (all)
 That ye do.

4. And if any has not
 (The wherewithal),
 He should fast for
 Two months consecutively
 Before they touch each other.
 But if any is unable
 To do so, he should feed
 Sixty indigent ones.
 This, that ye may show
 Your faith in God

And His Apostle.
 Those are limits (set
 By) God. For those who
 Reject (Him), there is
 A grievous Penalty.

5. Those who resist God
 And His Apostle will be
 Humbled to dust, as were
 Those before them: for We
 Have already sent down
 Clear Signs. And the Unbelievers
 (Will have) a humiliating Penalty,--

6. On the Day that
 God will raise them
 All up (again) and show
 Them the truth (and meaning)
 Of their conduct. God has
 Reckoned its (value), though
 They may have forgotten it,
 For God is Witness
 To all things.

  

SECTION 2.

7. Seest thou not that
 God doth know (all) that is
 In the heavens and
 On earth? There is not
 A secret consultation
 Between three, but He
 Makes the fourth among them,--
 Nor between five but

He makes the sixth,--
 Nor between fewer nor more,
 But He is in their midst,
 Wheresoever they be:
 In the end will He
 Tell them the truth
 Of their conduct, on the Day
 Of Judgment. For God
 Has full knowledge
 Of all things.

8. Turnest thou not thy sight
 Towards those who were
 Forbidden secret counsels
 Yet revert to that which
 They were forbidden (to do)?
 And they hold secret counsels
 Among themselves for iniquity
 And hostility, and disobedience
 To the Apostle. And when
 They come to thee,
 They salute thee,
 Not as God salutes thee,
 (But in crooked ways):
 And they say to themselves,
 "Why does not God
 Punish us for our words?"
 Enough for them is Hell:
 In it will they burn,
 And evil is that destination!

9. O ye who believe!
 When ye hold secret counsel,
 Do it not for iniquity
 And hostility, and disobedience

To the Prophet; but do it
 For righteousness and self-restraint;
 And fear God, to Whom
 Ye shall be brought back.

10. Secret counsels are only
 (Inspired) by the Evil One,
 In order that he may
 Cause grief to the Believers;
 But he cannot harm them
 In the least, except as
 God permits; and on God
 Let the Believers
 Put their trust.

11. O ye who believe!
 When ye are told
 To make room
 In the assemblies,
 (Spread out and) make room:
 (Ample) room will God provide
 For you. And when
 Ye are told to rise up,
 Rise up: God will
 Raise up, to (suitable) ranks
 (And degrees), those of you
 Who believe and who have

Been granted (mystic) Knowledge.
 And God is well-acquainted
 With all ye do.

12. O ye who believe
 When ye consult
 The Apostle in private,
 Spend something in charity
 Before your private consultation.
 That will be best for you,
 And most conducive
 To purity (of conduct).
 But if ye find not
 (The wherewithal), God is
 Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

13. Is it that ye are
 Afraid of spending sums
 In charity before your
 Private consultation (with him)

If, then, ye do not so,
 And God forgives you,
 Then (at least) establish
 Regular prayer; practise
 Regular charity; and obey
 God and His Apostle.
 And God is well-acquainted
 With all that ye do.

  

SECTION 3.

14. Turnest thou not
 Thy attention to those
 Who turn (in friendship)
 To such as have the Wrath
 Of God upon them?
 They are neither of you
 Nor of them, and they
 Swear to falsehood knowingly.

15. God has prepared for them
 A severe Penalty: evil
 Indeed are their deeds.

16. They have made their oaths
 A screen (for their misdeeds):
 Thus they obstruct (men)
 From the Path of God:
 Therefore shall they have
 A humiliating Penalty.

17. Of no profit whatever
 To them, against God,
 Will be their riches
 Nor their sons:

They will be Companions
 Of the Fire, to dwell
 Therein (for aye)!

18. One Day will God
 Raise them all up
 (For Judgment): then
 Will they swear to Him
 As they swear to you:
 And they think that they
 Have something (to stand upon).
 No, indeed! they are
 But liars!

19. The Evil One has
 Got the better of them:
 So he has made them
 Lose the remembrance
 Of God. They are the Party
 Of the Evil One. Truly,
 It is the Party
 Of the Evil One
 That will perish!

20. Those who resist
 God and His Apostle
 Will be among those
 Most humiliated.

21. God has decreed:
 "It is I and My apostles
 Who must prevail":
 For God is One
 Full of strength,
 Able to enforce His Will.

22. Thou wilt not find
 Any people who believe
 In God and the Last Day,
 Loving those who resist
 God and His Apostle,
 Even though they were
 Their fathers or their sons,
 Or their brothers, or
 Their kindred. For such
 He has written Faiths
 In their hearts, and strengthened
 Them with a spirit
 From Himself. And He
 Will admit them to Gardens
 Beneath which Rivers flow,
 To dwell therein (for ever).
 God will be well pleased
 With them, and they with Him.
 They are the Party
 Of God. Truly it is
 The Party of God that
 Will achieve Felicity.



  

Sura LIX.

  

Hashr, or The Gathering

  




1. Whatever is
 In the heavens and
 On earth, let it declare
 The Praises and Glory
 Of God: for He is
 The Exalted in Might,
 The Wise.

2. It is He Who got out
 The Unbelievers among
 The People of the Book
 From their homes
 At the first gathering
 (Of the forces).
 Little did ye think
 That they would get out:
 And they thought
 That their fortresses
 Would defend them from God!
 But the (Wrath of) God

Came to them from quarters
 From which they little
 Expected (it), and cast
 Terror into their hearts,
 So that they destroyed
 Their dwellings by their own
 Hands and the hands
 Of the Believers.
 Take warning, then,
 O ye with eyes (to see)!

3. And had it not been
 That God had decreed
 Banishment for them,
 He would certainly have
 Punished them in this world:
 And in the Hereafter
 They shall (certainly) have
 The Punishment of the Fire.

4. That is because they
 Resisted God and His Apostle:
 And if any one resists God,
 Verily God is severe
 In Punishment.

5. Whether ye cut down
 (O ye Muslims!)
 The tender palm-trees,
 Or ye left them standing
 On their roots, it was
 By leave of God, and
 In order that He might
 Cover with shame
 The rebellious transgressors.

6. What God has bestowed
 On His Apostle (and taken
 Away) from them--for this
 Ye made no expedition
 With either cavalry or camelry:
 But God gives power
 To His apostles over
 Any He pleases: and God
 Has power over all things.

7. What God has bestowed
 On His Apostle (and taken
 Away) from the people
 Of the townships,--belongs

To God,--to His Apostle
 And to kindred and orphans,
 The needy and the wayfarer;
 In order that it may not
 (Merely) make a circuit
 Between the wealthy among you.
 So take what the Apostle
 Assigns to you, and deny
 Yourselves that which he
 Withholds from you.
 And fear God; for God
 Is strict in Punishment.

8. (Some part is due)
 To the indigent Muhajirs,
 Those who were expelled
 From their homes and their property,
 While seeking Grace from God
 And (His) Good Pleasure,
 And aiding God and His Apostle:
 Such are indeed
 The sincere ones;--

9. But those who
 Before them, had homes
 (In Medina)
 And had adopted the Faith,--
 Show their affection to such
 As came to them for refuge,
 And entertain no desire
 In their hearts for things

Given to the (latter),
 But give them preference
 Over themselves, even though
 Poverty was their (own lot).
 And those saved from
 The covetousness of their own
 Souls,--they are the ones
 That achieve prosperity.

10. And those who came
 After them say: "Our Lord!
 Forgive us, and our brethren
 Who came before us
 Into the Faith,
 And leave not,
 In our hearts,
 Rancour (or sense of injury)
 Against those who have believed.
 Our Lord! Thou art
 Indeed Full of Kindness,
 Most Merciful."

  

SECTION 2.

11. Hast thou not observed
 The Hypocrites say
 To their misbelieving brethren
 Among the People of the Book?--
 "If ye are expelled,
 We too will go out
 With you, and we will
 Never hearken, to any one
 In your affair; and if
 Ye are attacked (in fight)

We will help you".
 But God is witness
 That they are indeed liars.

12. If they are expelled,
 Never will they go out
 With them; and if they
 Are attacked (in fight),
 They will never help them;
 And if they do help them,
 They will turn their backs;
 So they will receive no help.

13. Of a truth ye are
 Stronger (than they)
 Because of the terror
 In their hearts,
 (Sent) by God.
 This is because they are
 Men devoid of understanding.

14. They will not fight you
 (Even) together, except
 In fortified townships,
 Or from behind walls.
 Strong is their fighting (spirit)
 Amongst themselves:
 Thou wouldst think
 They were united,
 But their hearts are divided:
 That is because they

Are a people devoid
 Of wisdom.

15. Like those who lately
 Preceded them, they have
 Tasted the evil result
 Of their conduct; and
 (In the Hereafter there is)
 For them a grievous Penalty;--

16. (Their allies deceived them),
 Like the Evil One,
 When he says to man,
 "Deny God": but when
 (Man) denies God,
 (The Evil One) says,
 "I am free of thee:
 I do fear God,
 The Lord of the Worlds!"

17. The end of both will be
 That they will go
 Into the Fire, dwelling
 Therein for ever.
 Such is the reward
 Of the wrong-doers.

  

SECTION 3.

18. O ye who believe!
 Fear God,

And let every soul look
 To what (provision) he has
 Sent forth for the morrow.
 Yea, fear God:
 For God is well-acquainted
 With (all) that ye do.

19. And be ye not like
 Those who forgot God;
 And He made them forget
 Their own souls! Such
 Are the rebellious transgressors!

20. Not equal are
 The Companions of the Fire
 And the Companions
 Of the Garden:
 It is the Companions
 Of the Garden,
 That will achieve Felicity.

21. Had We sent down
 This Qur-an on a mountain,
 Verily, thou wouldst have seen
 It humble itself and cleave

Asunder for fear of God.
 Such are the similitudes
 Which We propound to men,
 That they may reflect.

22. God is He, than Whom
 There is no other god;--
 Who knows (all things)
 Both secret and open;
 He, Most Gracious,
 Most Merciful.

23. God is He, than Whom
 There is no other god;--
 The Sovereign, the Holy One,
 The Source of Peace
 (and Perfection),
 The Guardian of Faith,
 The Preserver of Safety,
 The Exalted in Might,
 The Irresistible, the Supreme:

Glory to God!
 (High is He)
 Above the partners
 They attribute to Him.

24. He is God, the Creator,
 The Evolver,
 The Bestower of Forms
 (Or Colours).
 To Him belongs
 The Most Beautiful Names:
 Whatever is in
 The heavens and on earth,
 Doth declare
 His Praises and Glory:
 And He is the Exalted
 In Might, the Wise.



  

Sura LX.

  

Mumtahana, or the Woman to be Examined.


1. O ye who believe!
 Take not My enemies
 And yours as friends
 (Or protectors),--offering them
 (Your) love, even though
 They have rejected the Truth
 That has come to you,
 And have (on the contrary)
 Driven out the Prophet
 And yourselves (from your homes),
 (Simply) because ye believe
 In God your Lord!
 If ye have come out
 To strive in My Way
 And to seek My Good Pleasure,
 (Take them not as friends),
 Holding secret converse
 Of love (and friendship)
 With them: for I know
 Full well all that ye
 Conceal and all that ye
 Reveal. And any of you
 That does this has strayed
 From the Straight Path.

2. If they were to get
 The better of you,

They would behave to you
 As enemies, and stretch forth
 Their hands and their tongues
 Against you for evil;
 And they desire that ye
 Should reject the Truth.

3. Of no profit to you
 Will be your relatives
 And your children
 On the Day of Judgment:
 He will judge between you:
 For God sees well
 All that ye do.

4. There is for you
 An excellent example (to follow)
 In Abraham and those with him,
 When they said
 To their people:
 "We are clear of you
 And of whatever ye worship
 Besides God: we have rejected
 You, and there has arisen,
 Between us and you, enmity
 And hatred for ever,--unless
 Ye believe in God
 And Him alone":
 But not when Abraham
 Said to his father:
 "I will pray for forgiveness

For thee, though I have
 No power (to get) aught
 On thy behalf from God."
 (They prayed): "Our Lord!
 In Thee do we trust,
 And to Thee do we turn
 In repentance: to Thee
 Is (our) final Goal.

5. "Our Lord! Make us not
 A (test and) trial
 For the Unbelievers,
 But forgive us, our Lord!
 For Thou art the Exalted
 In Might, the Wise."

6. There was indeed in them
 An excellent example for you
 To follow,--for those
 Whose hope is in God
 And in the Last Day.
 But if any turn away,
 Truly God is Free of all
 Wants, Worthy of all Praise.

  

SECTION 2.

7. It may be that God
 Will grant love (and friendship)
 Between you and those whom
 Ye (now) hold as enemies.
 For God has power
 (Over all things); And God is
 Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

8. God forbids you not,
 With regard to those who
 Fight you not for (your) Faith
 Nor drive you out
 Of your homes,
 From dealing kindly and justly
 With them: For God loveth
 Those who are just.

9. God only forbids you,
 With regard to those who
 Fight you for (your) Faith,
 And drive you out
 Of your homes, and support
 (Others) in driving you out,
 From turning to them
 (For friendship and protection).
 It is such as turn to them
 (In these circumstances),
 That do wrong.

10. O ye who believe!
 When there come to you
 Believing women refugees,
 Examine (and test) them:
 God knows best as to
 Their Faith: if ye ascertain
 That they are Believers,
 Then send them not back
 To the Unbelievers.
 They are not lawful (wives)

For the Unbelievers, nor are
 The (Unbelievers) lawful (husbands)
 For them. But pay
 The Unbelievers what they
 Have spent (on their dower).
 And there will be no blame
 On you if ye marry them
 On payment of their dower
 To them. But hold not
 To the guardianship of
 Unbelieving women: ask
 For what ye have spent
 On their dowers, and let
 The (Unbelievers) ask for
 What they have spent
 (On the dowers of women
 Who come over to you).
 Such is the command
 Of God: He judges
 (With justice) between you.
 And God is Full of
 Knowledge and Wisdom.

11. And if any
 Of your wives deserts you
 To the Unbelievers,
 And ye have an accession
 (By the coming over of
 A woman from the other side),
 Then pay to those
 Whose wives have deserted

The equivalent of what they
 Had spent (on their dower).
 And fear God,
 In Whom ye believe.

12. O Prophet!
 When believing women come
 To thee to take the oath
 Of fealty to thee, that they
 Will not associate in worship
 Any other thing whatever
 With God, that they
 Will not steal, that they
 Will not commit adultery
 (Or fornication), that they
 Will not kill their children,
 That they will not utter
 Slander, intentionally forging
 Falsehood, and that they
 Will not disobey thee
 In any just matter,
 Then do thou receive
 Their fealty, and pray to God
 For the forgiveness (of
 Their sins): for God is
 Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

13. O ye who believe!
 Turn not (for friendship)
 To people on whom
 Is the Wrath of God.

Of the Hereafter they are
 Already in despair, just as
 The Unbelievers are
 In despair about those
 (Buried) in graves.



  

Sura LXI.

  

Saff, or Battle Array.



1. Whatever is
 In the heavens and
 On earth, let it declare
 The Praises and Glory
 Of God: for He is
 The Exalted in Might,
 The Wise.

2. O ye who believe!
 Why say ye that
 Which ye do not?

3. Grievously odious is it
 In the sight of God
 That ye say that
 Which ye do not.

4. Truly God loves those
 Who fight in His Cause
 In battle array, as if
 They were a solid
 Cemented structure.

5. And remember, Moses said
 To his people: "O my people!

Why do ye vex and insult
 Me, though ye know
 That I am the apostle
 Of God (sent) to you?"
 Then when they went wrong,
 God let their hearts go wrong.
 For God guides not those
 Who are rebellious transgressors.

6. And remember, Jesus,
 The son of Mary, said:
 "O Children of Israel!
 I am the apostle of God
 (Sent) to you, confirming
 The Law (which came)
 Before me, and giving
 Glad Tidings of an Apostle
 To come after me,
 Whose name shall be Ahmad."
 But when he came to them
 With Clear Signs,
 They said, "This is
 Evident sorcery!"

7. Who doth greater wrong
 Than one who invents

Falsehood against God,
 Even as he is being invited
 To Islam? And God
 Guides not those
 Who do wrong.

8. Their intention is
 To extinguish God's Light
 (By blowing) with their mouths:
 But God will complete
 (The revelation of) His Light,
 Even though the Unbelievers
 May detest (it).

9. It is He Who has sent
 His Apostle with Guidance
 And the Religion of Truth,
 That he may proclaim it
 Over all religion,
 Even though the Pagans
 May detest (it).

  

SECTION 2.

10. O ye who believe!
 Shall I lead you
 To a bargain that will
 Save you from
 A grievous Penalty?--

11. That ye believe in God
 And His Apostle, and that
 Ye strive (your utmost)
 In the Cause of God,
 With your property
 And your persons:
 That will be best for you,
 If ye but knew!

12. He will forgive you
 Your sins, and admit you
 To Gardens beneath which
 Rivers flow, and to beautiful
 Mansions in Gardens
 Of Eternity: that is indeed
 The supreme Achievement.

13. And another (favour
 Will He bestow), which ye
 Do love,--help from God
 And a speedy victory.
 So give the Glad Tidings
 To the Believers.

14. O ye who believe!
 Be ye helpers of God:
 As said Jesus the son of Mary
 To the Disciples, "Who will be
 My helpers to (the work
 Of) God?" Said the Disciples,

"We are God's helpers!"
 Then a portion of the Children
 Of Israel believed, and
 A portion disbelieved:
 But We gave power
 To those who believed,
 Against their enemies,
 And they became
 The ones that prevailed.



  

Sura LXII.

  

Jumu'a, or the Assembly (Friday) Prayer.



1. Whatever is
 In the heavens and
 On earth, doth declare
 The Praises and Glory
 Of God,--the Sovereign,
 The Holy One, the Exalted
 In Might, the Wise.

2. It is He Who has sent
 Amongst the Unlettered
 An apostle from among
 Themselves, to rehearse
 To them His Signs,
 To sanctify them, and
 To instruct them in Scripture
 And Wisdom,--although

They had been, before,
 In manifest error;--

3. As well as (to confer
 All these benefits upon)
 Others of them, who
 Have not already joined them:
 And He is Exalted
 In Might, Wise.

4. Such is the Bounty of God,
 Which He bestows
 On whom He will:
 And God is the Lord
 Of the highest bounty.

5. The similitude of those
 Who were charged
 With the (obligations
 Of the) Mosaic Law,
 But who subsequently failed
 In those (obligations), is
 That of a donkey
 Which carries huge tomes
 (But understands them not).
 Evil is the similitude
 Of people who falsify
 The Signs of God:
 And God guides not
 People who do wrong.

6. Say: "O ye that
 Stand on Judaism!

If ye think that ye
 Are friends to God,
 To the exclusion of
 (Other) men, then express
 Your desire for Death,
 If ye are truthful!"

7. But never will they
 Express their desire
 (For Death), because of
 The (deeds) their hands
 Have sent on before them!
 And God knows well
 Those that do wrong!

8. Say: "The Death from which
 Ye flee will truly
 Overtake you: then will
 Ye be sent back
 To the Knower of things
 Secret and open: and He
 Will tell you (the truth
 Of) the things that ye did!"

  

SECTION 2.

9. O ye who believe!
 When the call is proclaimed
 To prayer on Friday
 (The Day of Assembly),

Hasten earnestly to the
 Remembrance
 Of God, and leave off
 Business (and traffic):
 That is best for you
 If ye but knew!

10. And when the Prayer
 Is finished, then may ye
 Disperse through the land,
 And seek of the Bounty
 Of God: and celebrate
 The Praises of God
 Often (and without stint):
 That ye may prosper.

11. But when they see
 Some bargain or some
 Amusement, they disperse
 Headlong to it, and leave
 Thee standing. Say:
 "The (blessing) from the Presence
 Of God is better than
 Any amusement or bargain!
 And God is the Best
 To provide (for all needs)."



  

Sura LXIII.

  

Munafiqun, or the Hypocrites.



1. When the Hypocrites
 Come to thee, they say,
 "We bear witness that thou
 Art indeed the Apostle
 Of God." Yea, God
 Knoweth that thou art
 Indeed His Apostle,
 And God beareth witness
 That the Hypocrites are
 Indeed liars.

2. They have made their oaths
 A screen (for their misdeeds):
 Thus they obstruct (men)
 From the Path of God:
 Truly evil are their deeds.

3. That is because they believed,
 Then they rejected Faith:
 So a seal was set
 On their hearts: therefore
 They understand not.

4. When thou lookest
 At them, their exteriors

Please thee; and when
 They speak, thou listenest
 To their words. They are
 As (worthless as hollow)
 Pieces of timber propped up,
 (Unable to stand on their own).
 They think that every
 Cry is against them.
 They are the enemies;
 So beware of them.
 The curse of God be
 On them! How are they
 Deluded (away from the Truth)!

5. And when it is said
 To them, "Come, the Apostle
 Of God will pray for your
 Forgiveness" they turn aside
 Their heads, and thou wouldst
 See them turning away
 Their faces in arrogance.

6. It is equal to them
 Whether thou pray for
 Their forgiveness or not.
 God will not forgive them.
 Truly God guides not
 Rebellious transgressors.

7. They are the ones who say,
 "Spend nothing on those
 Who are with God's Apostle,
 To the end that they

May disperse (and quit Medina)."
 But to God belong
 The treasures of the heavens
 And the earth; but
 The Hypocrites understand not.

8. They say, "If we
 Return to Medina, surely
 The more honourable (element)
 Will expel therefrom the meaner".
 But honour belongs to God
 And His Apostle, and
 To the Believers; but
 The Hypocrites know not.

  

SECTION 2.

9. O ye who believe!
 Let not your riches
 Or your children divert you
 From the remembrance of God.
 If any act thus,
 The loss is their own.

10. And spend something (in charity)
 Out of the substance
 Which We have bestowed
 On you, before Death
 Should come to any of you
 And he should say,
 "O my Lord! Why didst
 Thou not give me
 Respite for a little while?
 I should then have given

(Largely) in charity, and I
 Should have been one
 Of the doers of good".

11. But to no soul
 Will God grant respite
 When the time appointed
 (For it) has come; and God
 Is well acquainted
 With (all) that ye do.



  

Sura LXIV.

  

Tagabun, or Mutual Loss and Gain.



1. Whatever is
 In the heavens and
 On earth, doth declare
 The Praises and Glory
 Of God: to Him belongs
 Dominion, and to Him belongs
 Praise: and He has power
 Over all things.

2. It is He Who has
 Created you; and of you
 Are some that are
 Unbelievers, and some
 That are Believers:
 And God sees well
 All that ye do.

3. He has created the heavens
 And the earth
 In just proportions,
 And has given you shape,
 And made your shapes
 Beautiful: and to Him
 Is the final Goal.

4. He knows what is
 In the heavens
 And on earth;
 And He knows what
 Ye conceal and what
 Ye reveal: yea, God
 Knows well the (secrets)
 Of (all) hearts.

5. Has not the story
 Reached you, of those
 Who rejected Faith aforetime?
 So they tasted the evil
 Result of their conduct;
 And they had
 A grievous Penalty.

6. That was because there
 Came to them apostles
 With Clear Signs,
 But they said:
 "Shall (mere) human beings
 Direct us?" So they rejected
 (The Message) and turned away.
 But God can do without (them):
 And God is
 Free of all needs,
 Worthy of all praise.

7. The Unbelievers think
 That they will not be

Raised up (for Judgment).
 Say: "Yea, by my Lord,
 Ye shall surely be
 Raised up: then shall ye
 Be told (the truth) of
 All that ye did.
 And that is easy for God."

8. Believe, therefore, in God
 And His Apostle, and
 In the Light which We
 Have sent down. And God
 Is well acquainted
 With all that ye do.

9. The Day that He assembles
 You (all) for a Day
 Of Assembly,--that will be
 A day of mutual loss
 And gain (among you).
 And those who believe
 In God and work righteousness,--
 He will remove from them
 Their ills, and He will admit
 Them to gardens beneath which

Rivers flow, to dwell therein
 For ever: that will be
 The Supreme Achievement.

10. But those who reject Faith
 And treat Our Signs
 As falsehoods, they will be
 Companions of the Fire,
 To dwell therein for aye:
 And evil is that Goal.

  

SECTION 2.

11. No kind of calamity
 Can occur, except
 By the leave of God:
 And if any one believes
 In God, (God) guides his
 Heart (aright): for God
 Knows all things.

12. So obey God, and obey
 His Apostle: but if
 Ye turn back, the duty
 Of Our Apostle is but
 To proclaim (the Message)
 Clearly and openly.

13. God! There is no god
 But He: and on God,
 Therefore, let the Believers
 Put their trust.

14. O ye who believe!
 Truly, among your wives

And your children are (some
 That are) enemies to
 Yourselves: so beware
 Of them! But if ye
 Forgive and overlook,
 And cover up (their faults),
 Verily God is
 Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

15. Your riches and your children
 May be but a trial:
 But in the Presence of God,
 Is the highest Reward.

16. So fear God
 As much as ye can;
 Listen and obey;
 And spend in charity
 For the benefit of
 Your own souls.
 And those saved from
 The covetousness of their own

Souls,--they are the ones
 That achieve prosperity.

17. If ye loan to God
 A beautiful loan, He
 Will double it to
 Your (credit), and He
 Will grant you Forgiveness:
 For God is most Ready
 To appreciate (service)
 Most Forbearing,--

18. Knower of what is hidden
 And what is open,
 Exalted in Might,
 Full of Wisdom.



  

Sura LXV.

  

Talaq, or Divorce.



1. O Prophet! When ye
 Do divorce women,
 Divorce them at their
 Prescribed periods,
 And count (accurately)
 Their prescribed periods:
 And fear God your Lord:
 And turn them not out
 Of their houses, nor shall
 They (themselves) leave,
 Except in case they are
 Guilty of some open lewdness,
 Those are limits
 Set by God: and any
 Who transgresses the limits
 Of God, does verily
 Wrong his (own) soul:
 Thou knowest not if

Perchance God will
 Bring about thereafter
 Some new situation.

2. Thus when they fulfil
 Their term appointed,
 Either take them back
 On equitable terms
 Or part with them
 On equitable terms;
 And take for witness
 Two persons from among you,
 Endued with justice,
 And establish the evidence
 (As) before God. Such
 Is the admonition given
 To him who believes
 In God and the Last Day.
 And for those who fear
 God, He (ever) prepares
 A way out,

3. And He provides for him
 From (sources) he never
 Could imagine. And if
 Any one puts his trust
 In God, sufficient is (God)
 For him. For God will

Surely accomplish His purpose:
 Verily, for all things
 Has God appointed
 A due proportion.

4. Such of your women
 As have passed the age
 Of monthly courses, for them
 The prescribed period, if ye
 Have any doubts, is
 Three months, and for those
 Who have no courses
 (It is the same):
 For those who carry
 (Life within their wombs),
 Their period is until
 They deliver their burdens:
 And for those who
 Fear God, He will
 Make their path easy.

5. That is the Command
 Of God, which He
 Has sent down to you:
 And if any one fears God,
 He will remove his ills
 From him, and will enlarge
 His reward.

6. Let the women live
 (In 'iddat) in the same

Style as ye live,
 According to your means:
 Annoy them not, so as
 To restrict them.
 And if they carry (life
 In their wombs), then
 Spend (your substance) on them
 Until they deliver
 Their burden: and if
 They suckle your (offspring),
 Give them their recompense:
 And take mutual counsel
 Together, according to
 What is just and reasonable.
 And if ye find yourselves
 In difficulties, let another
 Woman suckle (the child)
 On the (father's) behalf.

7. Let the man of means
 Spend according to
 His means: and the man
 Whose resources are restricted,
 Let him spend according
 To what God has given him.
 God puts no burden
 On any person beyond
 What He has given him.
 After a difficulty, God
 Will soon grant relief.

  

SECTION 2.

8. How many populations
 That insolently opposed
 The command of their Lord
 And of His apostles,
 Did We not then
 Call to account,
 To severe account?
 And We imposed on them
 An exemplary Punishment.

9. Then did they taste
 The evil result of
 Their conduct, and the End
 Of their conduct
 Was Perdition.

10. God has prepared for them
 A severe Punishment
 (In the Hereafter).
 Therefore fear God,
 O ye men of understanding--
 Who have believed!
 For God hath indeed
 Sent down to you
 A Message,--

11. An Apostle, who rehearses
 To you the Signs of God
 Containing clear explanations,
 That he may lead forth
 Those who believe
 And do righteous deeds

From the depths of Darkness
 Into Light. And those who
 Believe in God and work
 Righteousness, He will admit
 To Gardens beneath which rivers
 Flow, to dwell therein
 For ever: God has indeed
 Granted for them
 A most excellent provision.

12. God is He Who
 Created seven Firmaments
 And of the earth
 A similar number.
 Through the midst
 Of them (all) descends
 His Command: that ye may
 Know that God has power
 Over all things, and that
 God comprehends all things
 In (His) Knowledge.



  

Sura LXVI.

  

Tahrim, or Holding (something) to be Forbidden.



1. O Prophet! Why
 Holdest thou to be forbidden
 That which God has
 Made lawful to thee?
 Thou seekest to please
 Thy consorts. But God
 Is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

2. God has already ordained
 For you, (O men),
 The dissolution of your oaths
 (In some cases): and God
 Is your Protector, and He
 Is Full of Knowledge
 And Wisdom.

3. When the Prophet disclosed
 A matter in confidence

To one of his consorts,
 And she then divulged it
 (To another), and God made it
 Known to him, he confirmed
 Part thereof and repudiated
 A part. Then when he
 Told her thereof, she said,
 "Who told thee this?"
 He said, "He told me
 Who knows and is well-acquainted
 (With all things)"

4. If ye two turn in repentance
 To Him, your hearts
 Are indeed so inclined;
 But if ye back up
 Each other against him,
 Truly God is his Protector,
 And Gabriel, and (every)
 Righteous one among those
 Who believe,--and furthermore,
 The angels--will back (him) up.

5. It may be, if he
 Divorced you (all)

That God will give him
 In exchange Consorts
 Better than you,
 Who submit (their wills),
 Who believe, who are devout,
 Who turn to God in repentance,
 Who worship (in humility),
 Who travel (for Faith) and fast,--
 Previously married or virgins.

6. O ye who believe!
 Save yourselves and your
 Families from a Fire
 Whose fuel is Men
 And Stones, over which
 Are (appointed) angels
 Stern (and) severe,
 Who flinch not (from
 Executing) the Commands
 They receive from God,
 But do (precisely) what
 They are commanded.

7. (They will say),
 "O ye Unbelievers!
 Make no excuses
 This Day! Ye are being

But requited for
 All that ye did!"

  

SECTION 2.

8. O ye who believe!
 Turn to God
 With sincere repentance:
 In the hope that
 Your Lord will remove
 From you your ills
 And admit you to Gardens
 Beneath which Rivers flow,--
 The Day that God
 Will not permit
 To be humiliated
 The Prophet and those
 Who believe with him.
 Their Light will run
 Forward before them
 And by their right hands,
 While they say, "Our Lord!
 Perfect our Light for us,
 And grant us Forgiveness:
 For Thou hast power
 Over all things."

9. O Prophet! Strive hard
 Against the Unbelievers
 And the Hypocrites,
 And be firm against them.

Their abode is Hell,--
 An evil refuge (indeed).

10. God sets forth,
 For an example
 To the Unbelievers,
 The wife of Noah
 And the wife of Lut:
 They were (respectively)
 Under two of our righteous
 Servants, but they were
 False to their (husbands),
 And they profited nothing
 Before God on their account,
 But were told: "Enter ye
 The Fire along with
 (Others) that enter!"

11. And God sets forth,
 As an example
 To those who believe,
 The wife of Pharaoh:

Behold she said:
 "O my Lord! build
 For me, in nearness
 To Thee, a mansion
 In the Garden,
 And save me from Pharaoh
 And his doings,
 And save me from
 Those that do wrong";

12. And Mary the daughter
 Of 'Imran, who guarded
 Her chastity; and We
 Breathed into (her body)
 Of Our spirit; and she
 Testified to the truth
 Of the words of her Lord
 And of his Revelations,
 And was one of the
 Devout (servants).



  

Sura LXVII.

  

Mulk, or Dominion.



1. Blessed be He
 In Whose hands
 Is Dominion;
 And He over all things
 Hath Power;--

2. He Who created Death
 And Life, that He
 May try which of you
 Is best in deed:
 And He is the Exalted
 In Might, Oft-Forgiving;--

3. He Who created
 The seven heavens
 One above another:
 No want of proportion
 Wilt thou see
 In the Creation
 Of (God) Most Gracious.
 So turn thy vision again:
 Seest thou any flaw?

4. Again turn thy vision
 A second time: (thy) vision
 Will come back to thee
 Dull and discomfited,
 In a state worn out.

5. And We have,
 (From of old),
 Adorned the lowest heaven
 With Lamps, and We
 Have made such (Lamps)
 (As) missiles to drive
 Away the Evil Ones,
 And have prepared for them
 The Penalty
 Of the Blazing Fire.

6. For those who reject
 Their Lord (and Cherisher)

Is the Penalty of Hell:
 And evil is (such) destination.

7. When they are cast therein,
 They will hear
 The (terrible) drawing in
 Of its breath
 Even as it blazes forth,

8. Almost bursting with fury:
 Every time a Group
 Is cast therein, its Keepers
 Will ask, "Did no Warner
 Come to you?"

9. They will say: "Yes indeed;
 A Warner did come to us,
 But we rejected him
 And said, "God never
 Sent down any (Message):
 Ye are innothing but
 An egregious delusion!"

10. They will further say:
 "Had we but listened
 Or used our intelligence,
 We should not (now)

Be among the Companions
 Of the Blazing Fire!"

11. They will then confess
 Their sins: but far
 Will be (Forgiveness)
 From the Companions
 Of the Blazing Fire!

12. As for those who
 Fear their Lord unseen,
 For them is Forgiveness
 And a great Reward.

13. And whether ye hide
 Your word or publish it,
 He certainly has (full) knowledge,
 Of the secrets of (all) hearts.

14. Should He not know,--
 He that created?
 And He is the One
 That understands the finest
 Mysteries (and) is
 Well-acquainted (with them).

  

SECTION 2.

15. It is He Who has
 Made the earth manageable

For you, so traverse
 Ye through its tracts
 And enjoy of the Sustenance
 Which He furnishes: but
 Unto Him is the Resurrection.

16. Do ye feel secure that
 He Who is in Heaven
 Will not cause you
 To be swallowed up
 By the earth when it
 Shakes (as in an earthquake)?

17. Or do ye feel secure
 That He Who is in Heaven
 Will not send against you
 A violent tornado
 (With showers of stones),
 So that ye shall
 Know how (terrible)
 Was My warning?

18. But indeed men before them
 Rejected (My warning):
 Then how (terrible) was
 My rejection (of them)?

19. Do they not observe
 The birds above them,

Spreading their wings
 And folding them in?
 None can uphold them
 Except (God) Most Gracious:
 Truly it is He
 That watches over all things.

20. Nay, who is there
 That can help you,
 (Even as) an army,
 Besides (God) Most Merciful?
 In nothing but delusion
 Are the Unbelievers.

21. Or who is there
 That can provide you
 With Sustenance if He
 Were to withhold His provision?
 Nay, they obstinately persist
 In insolent impiety
 And flight (from the Truth).

22. Is then one who
 Walks headlong, with his face
 Grovelling, better guided,--
 Or one who walks
 Evenly on a Straight Way?

23. Say: "It is He Who
 Has created you (and made
 You grow), and made
 For you the faculties
 Of hearing, seeing,
 Feeling and understanding:
 Little thanks it is ye give.

24. Say: "It is He Who
 Has multiplied you
 Through the earth,
 And to Him shall ye
 Be gathered together."

25. They ask: When will
 This promise be (fulfilled)?--
 If ye are telling
 The truth.

26. Say: "As to the knowledge
 Of the time, it is
 With God alone:
 I am (sent) only
 To warn plainly in public."

27. At length, when they
 See it close at hand,
 Grieved will be the faces
 Of the Unbelievers,

And it will be said
 (To them): "This is
 (The promise fulfilled),
 Which ye were calling for!"

28. Say: "See ye?--
 If God were
 To destroy me,
 And those with me,
 Or if He bestows
 His Mercy on us,--
 Yet who can deliver
 The Unbelievers from
 A grievous Penalty?"

29. Say: "He is (God)
 Most Gracious: we have
 Believed in Him,
 And on Him have we
 Put our trust:
 So, soon will ye know
 Which (of us) it is
 That is in manifest error."

30. Say: "See ye?--
 If your stream be
 Some morning lost
 (In the underground earth),
 Who then can supply you
 With clear-flowing water?"



  

Sura LXVIII.

  

Qalam, or the Pen, or Nun.



1. Nun. By the Pen
 And by the (Record)
 Which (men) write,--

2. Thou art not,
 By the grace of thy Lord,
 Mad or possessed.

3. Nay, verily for thee
 Is a Reward unfailing:

4. And thou (standest)
 On an exalted standard
 Of character.

5. Soon wilt thou see,
 And they will see,

6. Which of you is
 Afflicted with madness.

7. Verily it is thy Lord
 That knoweth best,
 Which (among men)
 Hath strayed from His Path:
 And He knoweth best
 Those who receive
 (True) Guidance.

8. So hearken not
 To those who
 Deny (the Truth),

9. Their desire is that
 Thou shouldst be pliant:
 So would they be pliant.

10. Heed not the type
 Of despicable man,--
 Ready with oaths,

11. A slanderer, going about
 With calumnies,

12. (Habitually) hindering (all) good,
 Transgressing beyond bounds,
 Deep in sin,

13. Violent (and cruel),--
 With all that, base-born,--

14. Because he possesses
 Wealth and (numerous) sons.

15. When to him are rehearsed
 Our Signs,
 "Tales of the Ancients",
 He cries!

16. Soon shall We brand
 (The beast) on the snout!

17. Verily We have tried them
 As We tried the People

Of the Garden,
 When they resolved to gather
 The fruits of the (garden)
 In the morning,

18. But made no reservation,
 ("If it be God's Will").

19. Then there came
 On the (garden)
 A visitation from thy Lord,
 (Which swept away) all around,
 While they were asleep.

20. So the (garden) became,
 By the morning, like
 A dark and desolate spot,
 (Whose fruit had been gathered).

21. As the morning broke,
 They called out,
 One to another,--

22. "Go ye to your tilth
 (Betimes) in the morning,

If ye would gather
 The fruits."

23. So they departed, conversing
 In secret low tones, (saying)--

24. "Let not a single indigent
 Person break in upon you
 Into the (garden) this day."

25. And they opened the morning,
 Strong in an (unjust) resolve.

26. But when they saw
 The (garden), they said:
 "We have surely lost our way:

27. "Indeed we are shut out
 (Of the fruits of our labour)!"

28. Said one of them,
 More just (than the rest):
 "Did I not say to you,
 "Why not glorify (God)?"

29. They said: "Glory
 To our Lord! Verily we
 Have been doing wrong!"

30. Then they turned, one
 Against another, in reproach.

31. They said: "Alas for us!
 We have indeed transgressed!

32. "It may be that our Lord
 Will give us in exchange
 A better (garden) than this:
 For we do turn to Him
 (In repentance)!"

33. Such is the Punishment
 (In this life); but greater
 Is the Punishment
 In the Hereafter,--
 If only they knew!

  

SECTION 2.

34. Verily, for the Righteous,
 Are Gardens of Delight,
 In the Presence
 Of their Lord.

35. Shall We then treat
 The People of Faith
 Like the People of Sin?

36. What is the matter
 With you? How judge ye?

37. Or have ye a Book
 Through which ye learn--

38. That ye shall have,
 Through it whatever
 Ye choose?

39. Or have ye Covenants
 With Us on oath,
 Reaching to the Day
 Of Judgment, (providing)
 That ye shall have
 Whatever ye shall demand?

40. Ask thou of them,
 Which of them will stand
 Surety for that!

41. Or have they some
 "Partners" (in Godhead)?
 Then let them produce
 Their "partners",
 If they are truthful!

42. The Day that the Shin
 Shall be laid bare,
 And they shall be summoned
 To bow in adoration,
 But they shall not be able,--

43. Their eyes will be
 Cast down,--ignominy will
 Cover them; seeing that
 They had been summoned
 Aforetime to bow in adoration,
 While they were whole,
 (And had refused).

44. Then leave Me alone
 With such as reject
 This Message: by degrees
 Shall We punish them

From directions they perceive not.

45. A (long) respite will I
 Grant them: truly
 Powerful is My Plan.

46. Or is it that thou dost
 Ask them for a reward,
 So that they are burdened
 With a load of debt?--

47. Or that the Unseen
 Is in their hands, so that
 They can write it down?

48. So wait with patience
 For the Command
 Of thy Lord, and be not
 Like the Companion
 Of the Fish,--when he
 Cried out in agony.

49. Had not Grace
 From His Lord
 Reached him, he
 Would indeed have been

Cast off on the naked
 Shore, in disgrace.

50. Thus did his Lord
 Choose him and make him
 Of the company
 Of the Righteous.

51. And the Unbelievers
 Would almost trip thee up
 With their eyes when they
 Hear the Message; and they
 Say: "Surely he is possessed!"

52. But it is nothing less
 Than a Message
 To all the worlds.



  

Sura LXIX.

  

Haqqa, or the Sure Reality.



1. The Sure Reality!

2. What is the Sure Reality?

3. And what will make
 Thee realise what
 The Sure Reality is?

4. The Thamud
 And the 'Ad people
 (Branded) as false
 The Stunning Calamity!

5. But the Thamud,--
 They were destroyed
 By a terrible Storm
 Of thunder and lightning!

6. And the 'Ad,--
 They were destroyed
 By a furious Wind,
 Exceedingly violent;

7. He made it rage
 Against them seven nights
 And eight days in succession:
 So that thou couldst see
 The (whole) people lying
 Prostrate in its (path),
 As if they had been
 Roots of hollow palm-trees
 Tumbled down!

8. Then seest thou any
 Of them left surviving?

9. And Pharaoh,
 And those before him,
 And the Cities Overthrown,
 Committed habitual Sin,

10. And disobeyed (each)
 The apostle of their Lord;
 So He punished them
 With an abundant Penalty.

11. We, when the water
 (Of Noah's Flood) overflowed
 Beyond its limits,
 Carried you (mankind),
 In the floating (Ark),

12. That We might
 Make it a Message
 Unto you, and that ears
 (That should hear the tale
 And) retain its memory
 Should bear its (lessons)
 In remembrance.

13. Then, when one
 Blast is sounded
 On the Trumpet,

14. And the earth is moved,
 And its mountains,
 And they are crushed to powder
 At one stroke,--

15. On that Day
 Shall the (Great) Event
 Come to pass,

16. And the sky will be
 Rent asunder, for it will
 That Day be flimsy,

17. And the angels will be
 On its sides,

And eight will, that Day,
 Bear the Throne
 Of thy Lord above them.

18. That Day shall ye be
 Brought to Judgment:
 Not an act of yours
 That ye hide will be hidden.

19. Then he that will be
 Given his Record
 In his right hand
 Will say: "Ah here!
 Read ye my Record!

20. "I did really understand
 That my Account would
 (One Day) reach me!"

21. And he will be
 In a life of Bliss,

22. In a Garden on high,

23. The Fruits whereof
 (Will hang in bunches)
 Low and near.

24. "Eat ye and drink ye,
 With full satisfaction;

Because of the (good)
 That ye sent before you,
 In the days that are gone!"

25. And he that will
 Be given his Record
 In his left hand,
 Will say: "Ah! would
 That my record had not
 Been given to me!

26. "And that I had never
 Realised how
 My account (stood)!

27. "Ah! would that (Death)
 Had made an end of me!

28. "Of no profit to me
 Has been my wealth!

29. "My power has
 Perished from me!"...

30. (The stern command will say):
 "Seize ye him,
 And bind ye him,

31. "And burn ye him
 In the Blazing Fire.

32. "Further, make him march
 In a chain, whereof
 The length is seventy cubits!

33. "This was he that
 Would not believe
 In God Most High,

34. "And would not encourage
 The feeding of the indigent!

35. "So no friend hath he
 Here this Day.

36. "Nor hath he any food
 Except the corruption
 From the washing of wounds,

37. "Which none do eat
 But those in sin."

  

SECTION 2.

38. So I do
 Call to witness
 What ye see

39. And what ye see not,

40. That this is
 Verily the word
 Of an honoured apostle;

41. It is not the word
 Of a poet:
 Little it is
 Ye believe!

42. Nor is it the word
 Of a soothsayer:
 Little admonition it is
 Ye receive.

43. (This is) a Message
 Sent down from the Lord
 Of the Worlds.

44. And if the apostle
 Were to invent
 Any sayings in Our name,

45. We should certainly seize him
 By his right hand,

46. And We should certainly
 Then cut off the artery
 Of his heart:

47. Nor could any of you
 Withhold him
 (From Our wrath).

48. But verily this
 Is a Message for
 The God-fearing.

49. And We certainly know
 That there are amongst you
 Those that reject (it).

50. But truly (Revelation)
 Is a cause of sorrow
 For the Unbelievers.

51. But verily it is Truth
 Of assured certainty.

52. So glorify the name
 Of thy Lord Most High.



  

Sura LXX.

  

Ma'arij, or the Ways of Ascent.



1. A questioner asked
 About a Penalty
 To befall--

2. The Unbelievers,
 The which there is none
 To ward off,--

3. (A Penalty) from God,
 Lord of the Ways
 Of Ascent.

4. The angels and
 The Spirit ascend
 Unto Him in a Day
 The measure whereof
 Is (as) fifty thousand years:

5. Therefore do thou hold
 Patience,--a Patience
 Of beautiful (contentment).

6. They see the (Day) indeed
 As a far-off (event):

7. But We see it
 (Quite) near.

8. The Day that
 The sky will be like
 Molten brass,

9. And the mountains will be
 Like wool,

10. And no friend will ask
 After a friend,

11. Though they will be put
 In sight of each other,--
 The sinner's desire will be:
 Would that he could

Redeem himself from
 The Penalty of that Day
 By (sacrificing) his children,

12. His wife and his brother,

13. His kindred who sheltered him,

14. And all, all that is
 On earth,--so it could
 Deliver him:

15. By no means!
 For it would be
 The Fire of Hell!--

16. Plucking out (his being)
 Right to the skull!--

17. Inviting (all) such
 As turn their backs
 And turn away their faces
 (From the Right),

18. And collect (wealth)
 And hide it (from use)!

19. Truly man was created
 Very impatient;--

20. Fretful when evil
 Touches him;

21. And niggardly when
 Good reaches him;--

22. Not so those devoted
 To Prayer;--

23. Those who remain steadfast
 To their prayer;

24. And those in whose wealth
 Is a recognised right

25. For the (needy) who asks
 And him who is prevented
 (For some reason from asking);

26. And those who hold
 To the truth of the Day
 Of Judgment;

27. And those who fear
 The displeasure of their Lord,--

28. For their Lord's displeasure
 Is the opposite of Peace
 And Tranquillity;--

29. And those who guard
 Their chastity,

30. Except with their wives
 And the (captives) whom
 Their right hands possess,--
 For (then) they are not
 To be blamed,

31. But those who trespass
 Beyond this are transgressors;--

32. And those who respect
 Their trusts and covenants;

33. And those who stand firm
 In their testimonies;

34. And those who guard
 (The sacredness) of their
 worship;--

35. Such will be
 The honoured ones
 In the Gardens (of Bliss).

  

SECTION 2.

36. Now what is
 The matter with the Unbelievers
 That they rush madly
 Before thee--

37. From the right
 And from the left,
 In crowds?

38. Does every man of them
 Long to enter
 The Garden of Bliss?

39. By no means!
 For We have created them
 Out of the (base matter)
 They know!

40. Now I do
 Call to witness

The Lord of all points
 In the East and the West
 That We can certainly--

41. Substitute for them
 Better (men) than they;
 And We are not
 To be defeated
 (In Our Plan).

42. So leave them
 To plunge in vain talk
 And play about,
 Until they encounter
 That Day of theirs which
 They have been promised!--

43. The Day whereon
 They will issue
 From their sepulchres
 In sudden haste
 As if they were
 Rushing to a goal-post
 (Fixed for them),--

44. Their eyes lowered
 In dejection,
 Ignominy covering them
 (All over)!
 Such is the Day
 The which they
 Are promised!



  

Sura LXXI.

  

Nuh, or Noah.



1. We sent Noah
 To his People
 (With the Command):
 "Do thou warn thy People
 Before there comes to them
 A grievous Penalty."

2. He said: "O my People!
 I am to you
 A Warner, clear and open:

3. "That ye should worship
 God, fear Him,
 And obey me:

4. "So He may forgive you
 Your sins and give you
 Respite for a stated Term:
 For when the Term given
 By God is accomplished,
 It cannot be put forward:
 If ye only knew."

5. He, said: "O my Lord!
 I have called to my People
 Night and day:

6. "But my call only
 Increases (their) flight
 (From the Right).

7. "And every time I have
 Called to them, that Thou
 Mightest forgive them,
 They have (only) thrust
 Their fingers into their ears,
 Covered themselves up with
 Their garments, grown obstinate,
 And given themselves up
 To arrogance.

8. "So I have called to them
 Aloud;

9. "Further I have spoken
 To them in public
 And secretly in private,

10. "Saying, "Ask forgiveness
 From your Lord;
 For He is Oft-Forgiving;

11. "He will send rain
 To you in abundance;

12. Give you increase
 In wealth and sons;
 And bestow on you
 Gardens and bestow on you
 Rivers (of flowing water).

13. "What is the matter
 With you, that ye
 Place not your hope
 For kindness and long-suffering
 In God,--

14. "Seeing that it is He
 That has created you
 In diverse stages?

15. "See ye not
 How God has created
 The seven heavens
 One above another,

16. "And made the moon
 A light in their midst,
 And made the sun
 As a (Glorious) Lamp?

17. "And God has produced
 You from the earth,
 Growing (gradually),

18. "And in the End
 He will return you
 Into the (earth),
 And raise you forth
 (Again at the Resurrection)?

19. "And God has made
 The earth for you
 As a carpet (spread out),

20. "That ye may go about
 Therein, in spacious roads."

  

SECTION 2.

21. Noah said: "O my Lord!
 They have disobeyed me,
 But they follow (men)
 Whose wealth and children
 Give them no Increase
 But only Loss.

22. "And they have devised
 A tremendous Plot.

23. "And they have said
 (To each other),
 "Abandon not your gods:
 Abandon neither Wadd
 Nor Suwa', neither
 Yaguth nor Ya'uq,
 Nor Nasr';--

24. "They have already
 Misled many; and
 Grant Thou no increase
 To the wrong-doers but in
 Straying (from their mark)."

25. Because of their sins
 They were drowned
 (In the flood),
 And were made to enter
 The Fire (of Punishment):
 And they found
 In lieu of God
 None to help them.

26. And Noah said:
 "O my Lord! Leave not
 Of the Unbelievers,
 A single one on earth!

27. "For, if Thou dost leave
 (Any of) them, they will
 But mislead Thy devotees,
 And they will breed none
 But wicked ungrateful ones.

28. "O my Lord! Forgive me,
 My parents, all who
 Enter my house in Faith,
 And (all) believing men

And believing women:
 And to the wrong-doers
 Grant Thou no increase
 But in Perdition!"



  

Sura LXXII.

  

Jinn, or the Spirits.



1. Say: It has been
 Revealed to me that
 A company of Jinns
 Listened (to the Qur-an).
 They said, 'We have
 Really heard a wonderful Recital!

2. 'It gives guidance
 To the Right,
 And we have believed therein:
 We shall not join (in worship)
 Any (gods) with our Lord.

3. 'And exalted is the Majesty
 Of our Lord: He has
 Taken neither a wife
 Nor a son.

4. 'There were some foolish ones
 Among us, who used
 To utter extravagant lies
 Against God;

5. 'But we do think
 That no man or spirit

Should say aught that is
 Untrue against God.

6. 'True, there were persons
 Among mankind who took shelter
 With persons among the Jinns,
 But they increased them
 In folly.

7. 'And they (came to) think
 As ye thought, that God
 Would not raise up
 Any one (to Judgment).

8. 'And we pried into
 The secrets of heaven;
 But we found it filled
 With stern guards
 And flaming fires.

9. 'We used, indeed, to sit there
 In (hidden) stations, to (steal)
 A hearing; but any
 Who listens now
 Will find a flaming fire
 Watching him in ambush.

10. 'And we understand not
 Whether ill is intended
 To those on earth,
 Or whether their Lord
 (Really) intends to guide
 Them to right conduct.

11. 'There are among us
 Some that are righteous,
 And some the contrary:
 We follow divergent paths.

12. 'But we think that we
 Can by no means frustrate
 God throughout the earth,
 Nor can we frustrate Him
 By flight.

13. 'And as for us,
 Since we have listened
 To the Guidance, we have
 Accepted it: and any
 Who believes in his Lord
 Has no fear, either
 Of a short (account)
 Or of any injustice.

14. 'Amongst us are some
 That submit their wills
 (To God), and some
 That swerve from justice.
 Now those who submit
 Their wills--they have

Sought out (the path)
 Of right conduct:

15. 'But those who swerve,--
 They are (but) fuel
 For Hell-fire'--

16. (And God's Message is):
 "If they (the Pagans)
 Had (only) remained
 On the (right) Way,
 We should certainly have
 Bestowed on them Rain
 In abundance.

17. "That We might try them
 By that (means).
 But if any turns away
 From the remembrance
 Of his Lord, He will
 Cause him to undergo
 A severe Penalty.

18. "And the places of worship
 Are for God (alone):
 So invoke not any one
 Along with God;

19. "Yet when the Devotee
 Of God stands forth
 To invoke Him, they just
 Make round him a dense crowd."

  

SECTION 2.

20. Say: "I do
 No more than invoke
 My Lord, and I join not
 With Him any (false god)."

21. Say: "It is not
 In my power to cause
 You harm, or to bring
 You to right conduct."

22. Say: "No one can
 Deliver me from God
 (If I were to disobey Him),
 Nor should I find refuge
 Except in Him,

23. "Unless I proclaim what
 I receive from God
 And His Messages:
 For any that disobey God
 And His Apostle,--for them
 Is Hell: they shall dwell
 Therein for ever."

24. At length, when they
 See (with their own eyes)
 That which they are promised,--
 Then will they know
 Who it is that is
 Weakest in (his) helper
 And least important
 In point of numbers.

25. Say: "I know not whether
 The (Punishment) which ye
 Are promised is near,
 Or whether my Lord
 Will appoint for it
 A distant term.

26. "He (alone) knows the Unseen,
 Nor does He make any one
 Acquainted with his Mysteries,--

27. "Except an apostle
 Whom He has chosen:

And then He makes
 A band of watchers
 March before him
 And behind him,

28. "That he may know
 That they have (truly)
 Brought and delivered
 The Messages of their Lord:
 And He surrounds
 (All the mysteries) that are
 With them, and takes account
 Of every single thing."



  

Sura LXXIII.

  

Muzzammil, or Folded in Garments.



1. O thou folded
 In garments!

2. Stand (to prayer) by night,
 But not all night,--

3. Half of it,--
 Or a little less,

4. Or a little more;
 And recite the Qur-an
 In slow, measured rhythmic tones.

5. Soon shall We send down
 To thee a weighty Message.

6. Truly the rising by night
 Is most potent for governing
 (The soul), and most suitable
 For (framing) the Word
 (Of Prayer and Praise).

7. True, there is for thee
 By day prolonged occupation
 With ordinary duties:

8. But keep in remembrance
 The name of thy Lord
 And devote thyself
 To Him whole-heartedly.

9. (He is) Lord of the East
 And the West: there is
 No god but He:
 Take Him therefore
 For (thy) Disposer of Affairs.

10. And have patience with what
 They say, and leave them
 With noble (dignity).

11. And leave Me
 (Alone to deal with)
 Those in possession of
 The good things of life,
 Who (yet) deny the Truth;
 And bear with them
 For a little while.

12. With Us are Fetters

(To bind them), and a Fire
 (To burn them),

13. And a Food that chokes,
 And a Penalty Grievous.

14. One Day the earth
 And the mountains
 Will be in violent commotion.
 And the mountains will be
 As a heap of sand
 Poured out and flowing down.

15. We have sent to you,
 (O men!) an apostle,
 To be a witness concerning you,
 Even as We sent
 An apostle to Pharaoh.

16. But Pharaoh disobeyed
 The apostle; so We
 Seized him with
 A heavy Punishment.

17. Then how shall ye,
 If ye deny (God),
 Guard yourselves against
 A Day that will make
 Children hoary-headed?--

18. Whereon the sky will be
 Cleft asunder?
 His Promise needs must
 Be accomplished.

19. Verily this is an Admonition:
 Therefore, whoso will, let him
 Take a (straight) path
 To his Lord!

  

SECTION 2.

20. Thy Lord doth know
 That thou standest forth
 (To prayer) nigh two-thirds
 Of the night, or half

The night, or a third
 Of the night, and so doth
 A party of those with thee.
 But God doth appoint Night
 And Day in due measure.
 He knoweth that ye are
 Unable to keep count thereof.
 So He hath turned to you
 (In mercy): read ye,
 Therefore, of the Qur-an
 As much as may be
 Easy for you. He knoweth
 That there may be (some)
 Among you in ill-health;
 Others travelling through the land,
 Seeking of God's bounty;
 Yet others fighting
 In God's Cause. Read ye,
 Therefore, as much of the Qur-an
 As may be easy (for you);
 And establish regular Prayer
 And give regular Charity;
 And loan to God
 A Beautiful Loan.

And whatever good
 Ye send forth
 For your souls,
 Ye shall find it
 In God's Presence,--
 Yea, better and
 Greater, in Reward.
 And seek ye the Grace
 Of God: for God is
 Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.



  

Sura LXXIV.

  

Muddaththir, or One Wrapped Up.



1. O thou wrapped up
 (In a mantle)!

2. Arise and deliver thy warning!

3. And thy Lord
 Do thou magnify!

4. And thy garments
 Keep free from stain!

5. And all abomination shun!

6. Nor expect, in giving,
 Any increase (for thyself)!

7. But, for thy Lord's (Cause),
 Be patient and constant!

8. Finally, when the trumpet
 Is sounded,

9. That will be--that Day--
 A Day of Distress,--

10. Far from easy
 For those without Faith.

11. Leave Me alone, (to deal)
 With the (creature) whom
 I created (bare and) alone!--

12. To whom I granted
 Resources in abundance,

13. And sons to be
 By his side!--

14. To whom I made
 (Life) smooth and comfortable!

15. Yet is he greedy--
 That I should add
 (Yet more);--

16. By no means!
 For to Our Signs
 He has been refractory!

17. Soon will I visit him
 With a mount of calamities!

18. For he thought
 And he plotted;--

19. And woe to him!
 How he plotted!--

20. Yea, woe to him:
 How he plotted!--

21. Then he looked round;

22. Then he frowned
 And he scowled;

23. Then he turned back
 And was haughty;

24. Then said he:
 "This is nothing but magic,
 Derived from of old;

25. "This is nothing but
 The word of a mortal!"

26. Soon will I
 Cast him into Hell-Fire!

27. And what will explain
 To thee what Hell-Fire is?

28. Naught doth it permit
 To endure, and naught
 Doth it leave alone!--

29. Darkening and changing
 The colour of man!

30. Over it are Nineteen.

31. And We have set none
 But angels as guardians
 Of the Fire; and We
 Have fixed their number

Only as a trial
 For Unbelievers,--in order
 That the People of the Book
 May arrive at certainty,
 And the Believers may increase
 In Faith,--and that no doubts
 May be left for the People
 Of the Book and the Believers,
 And that those in whose hearts
 Is a disease and the Unbelievers
 May say, "What symbol
 Doth God intend by this?
 Thus doth God leave to stray
 Whom He pleaseth, and guide
 Whom He pleaseth: and none
 Can know the forces
 Of thy Lord, except He.
 And this is no other than
 A warning to mankind.

  

SECTION 2.

32. Nay, verily:
 By the Moon,

33. And by the Night
 As it retreateth,

34. And by the Dawn
 As it shineth forth,--

35. This is but one
 Of the mighty (portents),

36. A warning to mankind,--

37. To any of you that
 Chooses to press forward,
 Or to follow behind;--

38. Every soul will be (held)
 In pledge for its deeds.

39. Except the Companions
 Of the Right Hand.

40. (They will be) in Gardens
 (Of Delight): they will
 Question each other,

41. And (ask) of the Sinners:

42. "What led you
 Into Hell-Fire?"

43. They will say:
 "We were not of those
 Who prayed;

44. "Nor were we of those
 Who fed the indigent;

45. "But we used to talk
 Vanities with vain talkers;

46. "And we used to deny
 The Day of Judgment,

47. "Until there came to us
 (The Hour) that is certain."

48. Then will no intercession
 Of (any) intercessors
 Profit them.

49. When what is
 The matter with them
 That they turn away
 From admonition?

50. As if they were
 Affrighted asses,

51. Fleeing from a lion!

52. Forsooth, each one of them
 Wants to be given
 Scrolls (of revelation) spread out!

53. By no means! But
 They fear not the Hereafter.

54. Nay, this surely
 Is an admonition:

55. Let any who will,
 Keep it in remembrance!

56. But none will keep it
 In remembrance except
 As God wills: He
 Is the Lord of Righteousness,
 And the Lord of Forgiveness.



  

Sura LXXV.

  

Qiyamat, or the Resurrection.



1. I do call to witness
 The Resurrection Day;

2. And I do call to witness
 The self-reproaching spirit:
 (Eschew Evil).

3. Does man think that We
 Cannot assemble his bones?

4. Nay, We are able to put
 Together in perfect order
 The very tips of his fingers.

5. But man wishes to do
 Wrong (even) in the time
 In front of him.

6. He questions: "When
 Is the Day of Resurrection?"

7. At length, when
 The Sight is dazed,

8. And the moon is
 Buried in darkness.

9. And the sun and moon
 Are joined together,--

10. That Day will Man say:
 "Where is the refuge?"

11. By no means!
 No place of safety!

12. Before thy Lord (alone),
 That Day will be
 The place of rest.

13. That Day will Man
 Be told (all) that he
 Put forward, and all
 That he put back.

14. Nay, man will be
 Evidence against himself,

15. Even though he were
 To put up his excuses.

16. Move not thy tongue
 Concerning the (Qur-an)
 To make haste therewith,

17. It is for Us to collect it
 And to promulgate it:

18. But when We have
 Promulgated it, follow thou
 Its recital (as promulgated):

19. Nay more, it is
 For us to explain it
 (And make it clear):

20. Nay, (ye men!)
 But ye love
 The fleeting life,

21. And leave alone
 The Hereafter.

22. Some faces, that Day,
 Will beam (in brightness
 And beauty);--

23. Looking towards their Lord;

24. And some faces, that Day,
 Will be sad and dismal,

25. In the thought that some
 Back-breaking calamity was about
 To be indicted on them;

26. Yea, when (the soul)
 Reaches to the collar-bone
 (In its exit),

27. And there will be a cry,
 "Who is a magician
 (To restore him)?"

28. And he will conclude
 That it was (the Time)
 Of Parting;

29. And one leg will be
 Joined with another:

30. That Day the Drive
 Will be (all) to thy Lord!

  

SECTION 2.

31. So he gave nothing
 In charity, nor
 Did he pray!--

32. But on the contrary,
 He rejected Truth
 And turned away!

33. Then did he stalk
 To his family
 In full conceit!

34. Woe to thee,
 (O man!, yea, woe!

35. Again, woe to thee,
 (O man!), yea, woe!

36. Does Man think
 That he will be left
 Uncontrolled, (without purpose)?

37. Was he not a drop
 Of sperm emitted
 (In lowly form)?

38. Then did he become
 A leech-like clot;
 Then did (God) make
 And fashion (him)
 In due proportion.

39. And of him He made
 Two sexes, male
 And female.

40. Has not He, (the same),
 The power to give life
 To the dead?



  

Sura LXXVI.

  

Dahr, or Time, or Insan, or Man.



1. Has there not been
 Over Man a long period
 Of Time, when he was
 Nothing--(not even) mentioned?

2. Verily We created
 Man from a drop
 Of mingled sperm,
 In order to try him:
 So We gave him (the gifts).
 Of Hearing and Sight.

3. We showed him, the Way:
 Whether he be grateful
 Or ungrateful (rests
 On his will).

4. For the Rejecters
 We have prepared

Chains, Yokes, and
 A Blazing Fire.

5. As to the Righteous,
 They shall drink
 Of a Cup (of Wine)
 Mixed with Kafur,--

6. A Fountain where
 The Devotees of God
 Do drink, making it
 Flow in unstinted abundance.

7. They perform (their) vows,
 And they fear a Day
 Whose evil flies far and wide.

8. And they feed, for the love
 Of God, the indigent,
 The orphan, and the captive,--

9. (Saying), "We feed you
 For the sake of God alone:
 No reward do we desire
 From you, nor thanks.

10. "We only fear a Day
 Of distressful Wrath
 From the side of our Lord."

11. But God will deliver
 Them from the evil
 Of that Day, and will
 Shed over them a Light
 Of Beauty and
 A (blissful) Joy.

12. And because they were
 Patient and constant, He will
 Reward them with a Garden
 And (garments of) silk.

13. Reclining in the (Garden)
 On raised thrones,
 They will see there neither
 The sun's (excessive heat)
 Nor (the moon's) excessive cold.

14. And the shades of the (Garden)
 Will come low over them,
 And the bunches (of fruit),
 There, will hang low
 In humility.

15. And amongst them will be
 Passed round vessels of silver
 And goblets of crystal,--

16. Crystal-clear, made of silver:
 They will determine
 The measure thereof
 (According to their wishes).

17. And they will be given
 To drink there of a Cup
 (Of Wine) mixed 
 With Zanjabil,--

18. A fountain there,
 Called Salsabil.

19. And round about them
 Will (serve) youths
 Of perpetual (freshness):
 If thou seest them,
 Thou wouldst think them
 Scattered Pearls.

20. And when thou lookest,
 It is there thou wilt see

A Bliss and
 A Realm Magnificent.

21. Upon them will be
 Green Garments of fine silk
 And heavy brocade,
 And they will be adorned
 With Bracelets of silver;
 And their Lord will
 Give to them to drink
 Of a Wine
 Pure and Holy.

22. "Verily this is a Reward
 For you, and your Endeavour
 Is accepted and recognised."

  

SECTION 2.

23. It is We Who
 Have sent down the Qur-an
 To thee by stages.

24. Therefore be patient
 With constancy to the Command
 Of thy Lord, and hearken not
 To the sinner or the ingrate
 Among them.

25. And celebrate the name

Of thy Lord morning
 And evening,

26. And part of the night,
 Prostrate thyself to Him;
 And glorify Him
 A long night through.

27. As to these, they love
 The fleeting life,
 And put away behind them
 A Day (that will be) hard.

28. It is We Who created
 Them, and We have made
 Their joints strong;
 But, when We will,
 We can substitute
 The like of them
 By a complete change.

29. This is an admonition:
 Whosoever will, let him
 Take a (straight) Path
 To his Lord.

30. But ye will not,
 Except as God wills;

For God is full of
 Knowledge and Wisdom.

31. He will admit
 To His Mercy Whom He will;
 But the wrong-doers,--
 For them has He prepared
 A grievous Penalty.



  

Sura LXXVII.

  

Mursalat, or Those Sent Forth.



1. By the (Winds) Sent Forth
 One after another
 (To man's profit);

2. Which then blow violently
 In tempestuous Gusts,

3. And scatter (things)
 Far and wide;

4. Then separate them,
 One from another,

5. Then spread abroad
 A Message,

6. Whether of Justification
 Or of Warning;--

7. Assuredly, what ye are
 Promised must come to pass.

8. Then when the stars
 Become dim;

9. When the heaven
 Is cleft asunder;

10. When the mountains are
 Scattered (to the winds) as dust;

11. And when the apostles
 Are (all) appointed a time
 (To collect);--

12. For what Day are these
 (Portents) deferred?

13. For the Day of Sorting out.

14. And what will explain
 To thee what is
 The Day of Sorting out?

15. Ah woe, that Day,
 To the Rejecters of Truth!

16. Did We not destroy
 The men of old
 (For their evil)?

17. So shall We make
 Later (generations)
 Follow them.

18. Thus do We deal
 With men of sin.

19. Ah woe, that Day,
 To the Rejecters of Truth!

20. Have We not created
 You from a fluid
 (Held) despicable?--

21. The which We placed
 In a place of rest,
 Firmly fixed,

22. For a period (of gestation),
 Determined (according to need)?

23. For We do determine
 (According to need); for We
 Are the Best to determine (things).

24. Ah woe, that Day!
 To the Rejecters of Truth!

25. Have We not made
 The earth (as a place)
 To draw together

26. The living and the dead,

27. And made therein
 Mountains standing firm,
 Lofty (in stature);
 And provided for you
 Water sweet (and wholesome)?

28. Ah woe, that Day,
 To the Rejecters of Truth!

29. (It will be said:)
 "Depart ye to that
 Which ye used to reject
 As false!

30. "Depart ye to a Shadow
 (Of smoke ascending)
 In three columns,

31. "(Which yields) no shade
 Of coolness, and is
 Of no use against
 The fierce Blaze.

32. "Indeed it throws about
 Sparks (huge) as Forts,

33. "As if there were
 (A string of) yellow camels
 (Marching swiftly).

34. Ah woe, that Day,
 To the Rejecters of Truth!

35. That will be a Day
 When they shall not

Be able to speak,

36. Nor will it be
 Open to them
 To put forth pleas.

37. Ah woe, that Day,
 To the Rejecters of Truth!

38. That will be a Day
 Of Sorting out! We shall
 Gather you together
 And those before (you)!

39. Now, if ye have
 A trick (or plot),
 Use it against Me!

40. Ah woe, that Day,
 To the Rejecters of Truth!

  

SECTION 2.

41. As to the Righteous,
 They shall be amidst
 (Cool) shades and springs
 (Of water),

42. And (they shall have)
 Fruits,--all they desire.

43. "Eat ye and drink ye
 To your heart's content:
 For that ye worked
 (Righteousness).

44. Thus do We certainly
 Reward the Doers of Good.

45. Ah woe, that Day,
 To the Rejecters of Truth!

46. (O ye Unjust!)
 Eat ye and enjoy yourselves
 (But) a little while,
 For that ye are Sinners.

47. Ah woe, that Day,
 To the Rejecters of Truth!

48. And when it is said
 To them, "Prostrate yourselves!"
 They do not so.

49. Ah woe, that Day,
 To the Rejecters of Truth!

50. Then what Message,
 After that,
 Will they believe in?



  

Sura LXXVIII.

  

Nabaa, or The (Great) News.



1. Concerning what
 Are they disputing?

2. Concerning the Great News,

3. About which they
 Cannot agree.

4. Verily, they shall soon
 (Come to) know!

5. Verily, verily they shall
 Soon (come to) know!

6. Have We not made
 The earth as a wide
 Expanse,

7. And the mountains as pegs?

8. And (have We not) created
 You in pairs,

9. And made your sleep
 For rest,

10. And made the night
 As a covering,

11. And made the day
 As a means of subsistence?

12. And (have We not)
 Built over you
 The seven firmaments,

13. And placed (therein)
 A Light of Splendour?

14. And do We not send down
 From the clouds water
 In abundance,

15. That We may produce
 Therewith corn and vegetables,

16. And gardens of luxurious growth?

17. Verily the Day
 Of Sorting Out
 Is a thing appointed,--

18. The Day that the Trumpet
 Shall be sounded, and ye
 Shall come forth in crowds;

19. And the heavens
 Shall be opened
 As if there were doors,

20. And the mountains
 Shall vanish, as if
 They were a mirage.

21. Truly Hell is
 As a place of ambush,--

22. For the transgressors
 A place of destination:

23. They will dwell therein
 For ages.

24. Nothing cool shall they taste
 Therein, nor any drink,

25. Save a boiling fluid
 And a fluid, dark, murky,
 Intensely cold,--

26. A fitting recompense
 (For them).

27. For that they used not
 To fear any account
 (For their deeds),

28. But they (impudently) treated
 Our Signs as false.

29. And all things have We
 Preserved on record.

30. "So taste ye (the fruits
 Of your deeds);
 For no increase
 Shall We grant you,
 Except in Punishment.

  

SECTION 2.

31. Verily for the Righteous
 There will be
 A fulfilment of
 (The Heart's) desires;

32. Gardens enclosed, and Grapevines;

33. Companions of Equal age;

34. And a Cup full
 (To the brim).

35. No Vanity shall they hear
 Therein, nor Untruth;--

36. Recompense from thy Lord,
 A Gift, (amply) sufficient,--

37. (From the Lord
 Of the heavens
 And the earth, and all between,--
 (God) Most Gracious:
 None shall have power
 To argue with Him.

38. The Day that
 The Spirit and the angels
 Will stand forth in ranks,
 None shall speak
 Except any who is
 Permitted by (God) Most Gracious,
 And he will say
 What is right.

39. that day will be
 The sure Reality:
 Therefore, whoso will let him
 Take a (straight) Return
 To his Lord!

40. Verily, we have warned you
 Of a Penalty near,--
 The Day when man will
 See (the Deeds) which
 His hands have sent forth,
 And the Unbeliever will say,
 "Woe unto me! Would that
 I were mere dust!"



  

Sara LXXIX.

  

Nazi'at, or Those Who Tear Out.



1. By the (angels)
 Who tear out
 (The souls of the wicked)
 With violence;

2. By those who gently
 Draw out (the souls
 Of the blessed);

3. And by those who glide
 Along (on errands of mercy),

4. Then press forward
 As in a race,

5. Then arrange to do
 (The Commands of their Lord),--

6. One Day everything that
 Can be in commotion will
 Be in violent commotion,

7. Followed by oft-repeated
 (Commotions):

8. Hearts that Day 
 Will be in agitation;

9. Cast down will be
 (Their owners') eyes.

10. They say (now): "What!
 Shall we indeed be
 Returned to (our) former state?--

11. "What!--when we shall
 Have become rotten bones?"

12. They say: "It would
 In that case, be
 A return with loss!"

13. But verily, it will
 Be but a single

(Compelling) Cry,

14. When, behold, they
 Will be in the (full)
 Awakening (to Judgment).

15. Has the story
 Of Moses reached thee?

16. Behold, thy Lord did call
 To him in the sacred valley
 Of Tuwa:--

17. "Go thou to Pharaoh,
 For he has indeed
 Transgressed all bounds:

18. "And say to him,
 "Wouldst thou that thou
 Shouldst he purified
 (From sin)?--

19. "And that I guide thee
 To thy Lord, so thou
 Shouldst fear Him?"

20. Then did (Moses) show him
 The Great Sign.

21. But (Pharaoh) rejected it
 And disobeyed (guidance);

22. Further, he turned his back,
 Striving hard (against God).

23. Then he collected (his men)
 And made a proclamation,

24. Saying, "I am your Lord,
 Most High".

25. But God did punish him,
 (And made an) example
 Of him,--in the Hereafter,
 As in this life.

26. Verily in this is
 An instructive warning
 For whosoever feareth (God).

  

SECTION 2.

27. What! Are ye the more
 Difficult to create
 Or the heaven (above)?
 (God) hath constructed it:

28. On high hath He raised
 Its canopy, and He hath
 Given it order and perfection.

29. Its night doth He
 Endow with darkness,
 And its splendour doth He
 Bring out (with light).

30. And the earth, moreover,
 Hath He extended
 (To a wide expanse);

31. He draweth out
 Therefrom its moisture
 And its pasture;

32. And the mountains
 Hath He firmly fixed;

33. For use and convenience
 To you and your cattle.

34. Therefore, when there comes
 The great, overwhelming (Event),--

35. The Day when Man
 Shall remember (all)
 That he strove for,

36. And Hell-Fire shall be
 Placed in full view
 For (all) to see,--

37. Then, for such as had
 Transgressed all bounds,

38. And had preferred
 The life of this world,

39. The Abode will be
 Hell-Fire;

40. And for such as had
 Entertained the fear
 Of standing before
 Their Lord's (tribunal)
 And had restrained
 (Their) soul from lower Desires,

41. Their Abode will be
 The Garden.

42. They ask thee
 About the Hour,--"When
 Will be its appointed time?"

43. Wherein art thou (concerned)
 With the declaration thereof?

44. With thy Lord is
 The Limit fixed therefor.

45. Thou art but a Warner
 For such as fear it.

46. The Day they see it,
 (It will be) as if they
 Had tarried but a single
 Evening, or (at most till)
 The following morn!



  

Sura LXXX.

  

'Abasa, or He Frowned.



1. (The Prophet) frowned
 And turned away,

2. Because there came to him
 The blind man (interrupting).

3. But what could tell thee
 But that perchance he might
 Grow (in spiritual understanding)?--

4. Or that he might receive
 Admonition, and the teaching
 Might profit him?

5. As to one who regards
 Himself as self-sufficient,

6. To him dost thou attend;

7. Though it is no blame
 To thee if he grow not
 (In spiritual understanding).

8. But as to him who came
 To thee striving earnestly,

9. And with fear
 (In his heart),

10. Of him wast thou unmindful.

11. By no means
 (Should it be so)!
 For it is indeed
 A Message of instruction:

12. Therefore let whoso will,
 Keep it in remembrance.

13. (It is) in Books
 Held (greatly) in honour,

14. Exalted (in dignity),
 Kept pure and holy,

15. (Written) by the hands
 Of scribes--

16. Honourable and
 Pious and Just.

17. Woe to man!
 What hath made him
 Reject God:

18. From what stuff
 Hath He created him?

19. From a sperm-drop:
 He hath created him, and then
 Mouldeth him in due proportions;

20. Then doth He make
 His path smooth for him;

21. Then He causeth him to die,
 And putteth him in his Grave;

22. Then, when it is
 His Will, He will
 Raise him up (again).

23. By no means hath he
 Fulfilled what God
 Hath commanded him.

24. Then let man look
 At his Food,
 (And how We provide it):

25. For that We pour forth
 Water in abundance,

26. And We split the earth
 In fragments,

27. And produce therein Corn,

28. And Grapes and nutritious Plants,

29. And Olives and Dates,

30. And enclosed Gardens,
 Dense with lofty trees,

31. And Fruits and Fodder,--

32. For use and convenience
 To you and your cattle.

33. At length, when there
 Comes the Deafening Noise,--

34. That Day shall a man
 Flee from his own brother,

35. And from his mother
 And his father,

36. And from his wife
 And his children.

37. Each one of them,
 That Day, will have
 Enough concern (of his own)
 To make him indifferent
 To the others,

38. Some Faces that Day
 Will be beaming,

39. Laughing, rejoicing.

40. And other faces that Day
 Will be dust-stained;

41. Blackness will cover them:

42. Such will be
 The Rejecters of God,
 The Doers of Iniquity.



  

Sura LXXXI.

  

Takwir, or the Folding Up.



1. When the sun
 (With its spacious light)
 Is folded up;

2. When the stars
 Fall, losing their lustre;

3. When the mountains vanish
 (Like a mirage);

4. When the she-camels,
 Ten months with young,
 Are left untended;

5. When the wild beasts
 Are herded together

(In human habitations);

6. When the oceans
 Boil over with a swell;

7. When the souls
 Are sorted out,
 (Being joined, like with like);

8. When the female (infant),
 Buried alive, is questioned--

9. For what crime
 She was killed;

10. When the Scrolls
 Are laid open;

11. When the World on High
 Is unveiled;

12. When the Blazing Fire
 Is kindled to fierce heat;

13. And when the Garden
 Is brought near;--

14. (Then) shall each soul know
 What it has put forward.

15. So verily I call
 To witness the Planets--
 That recede,

16. Go straight, or hide;

17. And the Night
 As it dissipates;

18. And the Dawn
 As it breathes away
 The darkness;--

19. Verily this is the word
 Of a most honourable Messenger,

20. Endued with Power,
 With rank before
 The Lord of the Throne,

21. With authority there,
 (And) faithful to his trust.

22. And (O people!)
 Your Companion is not
 One possessed;

23. And without doubt he saw him
 In the clear horizon.

24. Neither doth he withhold
 Grudgingly a knowledge
 Of the Unseen.

25. Nor is it the word
 Of an evil spirit accursed!

26. When whither go ye?

27. Verily this is no less
 Than a Message
 To (all) the Worlds:

28. (With profit) to whoever
 Among you wills
 To go straight:

29. But ye shall not will
 Except as God wills,--
 The Cherisher of the Worlds.



  

Sura LXXXII.

  

Infitar, or The Cleaving Asunder.



1. When the Sky
 Is cleft asunder;

2. When the Stars
 Are scattered;

3. When the Oceans
 Are suffered to burst forth;

4. And when the Graves
 Are turned upside down;--

5. (Then) shall each soul know
 What it hath sent forward
 And (what it hath) kept back.

6. O man! what has
 Seduced thee from
 Thy Lord Most Beneficent?--

7. Him Who created thee.
 Fashioned thee in due proportion
 And gave thee a just bias;

8. In whatever Form He wills,
 Does He put thee together.

9. Nay! but ye do
 Reject Right and Judgment!

10. But verily over you
 (Are appointed angels)
 To protect you,--

11. Kind and honourable,--
 Writing down (your deeds):

12. They know (and understand)
 All that ye do.

13. As for the Righteous,
 They will be in Bliss;

14. And the Wicked--
 They will be in the Fire,

15. Which they will enter
 On the Day of Judgment,

16. And they will not be
 Able to keep away therefrom.

17. And what will explain
 To thee what the Day
 Of Judgment is?

18. Again, what will explain
 To thee what the Day
 Of Judgment is?

19. (It will be) the Day
 When no soul shall have
 Power (to do) aught
 For another 
 For the Command, that Day,
 Will be (wholly) with God.



  

Sura LXXXIII.

  

Tatfif, or Dealing in Fraud.



1. Woe to those
 That deal in fraud,--

2. Those who, when they
 Have to receive by measure
 From men, exact full measure,

3. But when they have
 To give by measure
 Or weight to men,
 Give less than due.

4. Do they not think
 That they will be called
 To account?--

5. On a Mighty Day,

6. A Day when (all) mankind
 Will stand before
 The Lord of the Worlds?

7. Nay! Surely the Record
 Of the Wicked is

(Preserved) in Sijjin.

8. And what will explain
 To thee what Sijjin is?

9. (There is) a Register
 (Fully) inscribed.

10. Woe, that Day, to those
 That deny--

11. Those that deny
 The Day of Judgment.

12. And none can deny it
 But the Transgressor
 Beyond bounds,
 The Sinner!

13. When Our Signs are rehearsed
 To him, he says,
 "Tales of the Ancients!"

14. By no means!
 But on their hearts
 Is the stain of the (ill)
 Which they do!

15. Verily, from (the Light
 Of) their Lord, that Day,
 Will they be veiled.

16. Further, they will enter
 The Fire of Hell.

17. Further, it will be said
 To them: "This is
 The (reality) which ye
 Rejected as false!

18. Nay, verily the Record
 Of the Righteous is
 (Preserved) in 'Illiyin.

19. And what will explain
 To thee what 'Illiyin is?

20. (There is) a Register
 (Fully) inscribed,

21. To which bear witness
 Those Nearest (to God),

22. Truly the Righteous
 Will be in Bliss:

23. On Thrones (of Dignity)
 Will they command a sight
 (Of all things):

24. Thou wilt recognise
 In their Faces
 The beaming brightness of Bliss.

25. Their thirst will be slaked
 With Pure Wine sealed:

26. The seal thereof will be
 Musk: and for this
 Let those aspire,
 Who have aspirations:

27. With it will be (given)
 A mixture of Tasnim:

28. A spring, from (the waters)
 Whereof drink
 Those Nearest to God.

29. Those in sin used
 To laugh at those
 Who believed,

30. And whenever they passed
 By them, used to wink
 At each other (in mockery);

31. And when they returned
 To their own people,
 They would return jesting;

32. And whenever they saw them,
 They would say, "Behold!
 These are the people
 Truly astray!"

33. But they had not been
 Sent as Keepers over them!

34. But on this Day
 The Believers will laugh
 At the Unbelievers:

35. On Thrones (of Dignity)
 They will command (a sight)
 (Of all things),

36. Will not the Unbelievers
 Have been paid back
 For what they did?



  

Sura LXXXIV.

  

Inshiqaq, or The Rending Asunder.



1. When the Sky is
 Rent asunder,

2. And hearkens to
 (The Command of) its Lord,--
 And it must needs
 (Do so);--

3. And when the Earth
 Is flattened out,

4. And casts forth
 What is within it
 And becomes (clean) empty,

5. And hearkens to
 (The Command of) its Lord,--
 And it must needs
 (Do so);--(then will come
 Home the full Reality)

6. O thou man!
 Verily thou art ever
 Toiling on towards thy Lord--
 Painfully toiling,--but thou
 Shalt meet Him.

7. Then he who is given
 His Record in his
 Right hand,

8. Soon will his account
 Be taken by an easy reckoning,

9. And he will turn
 To his people, rejoicing!

10. But he who is given
 His Record behind his back,--

11. Soon will he cry
 For Perdition,

12. And he will enter
 A Blazing Fire.

13. Truly, did he go about
 Among his people, rejoicing!

14. Truly, did he think
 That he would not
 Have to return (to Us)!

15. Nay, nay! for his Lord
 Was (ever) watchful of him!

16. So I do call
 To witness the ruddy glow
 Of Sunset;

17. The Night and its Homing;

18. And the Moon
 In her Fulness:

19. Ye shall surely travel
 From stage to stage

20. What then is the matter
 With them, that they
 Believe not?--

21. And when the Qur-an
 Is read to them, they
 Fall not prostrate,

22. But on the contrary
 The Unbelievers reject (it).

23. But God has full Knowledge
 Of what they secrete
 (In their breasts).

24. So announce to them
 A Penalty Grievous,

25. Except to those who believe
 And work righteous deeds:
 For them is a Reward
 That will never fail.



  

Sura LXXXV.

  

Buruj, or The Zodiacal Signs.



1. By the Sky, (displaying)
 The Zodiacal Signs;

2. By the promised Day
 (Of Judgment);

3. By one that witnesses,
 And the subject of the witness;--

4. Woe to the makers
 Of the pit (of fire),

5. Fire supplied (abundantly)
 With Fuel:

6. Behold! they sat
 Over against the (fire),

7. And they witnessed
 (All) that they were doing
 Against the Believers.

8. And they ill-treated them
 For no other reason than
 That they believed in God,
 Exalted in Power,
 Worthy of all Praise!--

9 Him to Whom belongs
 The dominion of the heavens
 And the earth!
 And God is Witness
 To all things.

10. Those who persecute (or draw
 into temptation)
 The Believers, men and women,
 And do not turn
 In repentance, will have
 The Penalty of Hell:
 They will have the Penalty
 Of the Burning Fire.

11. For those who believe
 And do righteous deeds,
 Will be Gardens,
 Beneath which Rivers flow:
 That is the great Salvation,
 (The fulfilment of all desires),

12. Truly strong is the Grip
 (And Power) of thy Lord.

13. It is He Who creates
 From the very beginning,
 And He can restore (life).

14. And He is the Oft-Forgiving,
 Full of loving-kindness,

15. Lord of the Throne of Glory,

16. Doer (without let)
 Of all that He intends.

17. Has the story
 Reached thee,
 Of the Forces--

18. Of Pharaoh
 And the Thamud?

19. And yet the Unbelievers
 (Persist) in rejecting
 (The Truth)!

20. But God doth
 Encompass them
 From behind!

21. Nay, this is
 A Glorious Qur-an,

22. (Inscribed) in
 A Tablet Preserved!



  

Sura LXXXVI.

  

Tariq, or The Night-Visitant.



1. By the Sky
 And the Night-Visitant
 (Therein);--

2. And what will explain to thee
 What the Night-Visitant is?--

3. (It is) the Star
 Of piercing brightness;--

4. There is no soul but has
 A protector over it.

5. Now let man but think
 From what he is created!

6. He is created from
 A drop emitted--

7. Proceeding from between
 The backbone and the ribs:

8. Surely (God) is able
 To bring him back
 (To life)!

9. The Day that
 (All) things secret
 Will be tested,

10. (Man) will have
 No power,
 And no helper.

11. By the Firmament
 Which returns (in its round),

12. And by the Earth
 Which opens out
 (For the gushing of springs
 Or the sprouting of vegetation),--

13. Behold this is the Word
 That distinguishes (Good
 From Evil):

14. It is not a thing
 For amusement.

15. As for them, they
 Are but plotting a scheme,

16. And I am planning
 A scheme.

17. Therefore grant a delay
 To the unbelievers:
 Give respite to them
 Gently (for awhile).



  

Sura LXXXVII.

  

A'la, or The Most High.


1. Glorify the name
 Of' thy Guardian-Lord
 Most High,

2. Who hath created,
 And further, given
 Order and proportion;

3. Who hath ordained laws.
 And granted guidance;

4. And Who bringeth out
 The (green and luscious) pasture,

5. And then doth make it
 (But) swarthy stubble.

6. By degrees shall We
 Teach thee to declare

(The Message), so thou
 Shalt not forget,

7. Except as God wills:
 For He knoweth
 What is manifest
 And what is hidden.

8. And We will make it
 Easy for thee (to follow)
 The simple (Path).

9. Therefore give admonition
 In case the admonition
 Profits (the hearer).

10. The admonition will be received
 By those who fear (God):

11. But it will be avoided
 By those most unfortunate ones,

12. Who will enter
 The Great Fire,

13. In which they will then
 Neither die nor live.

14. But those will prosper
 Who purify themselves,

15. And glorify the name
 Of their Guardian-Lord,
 And (lift their hearts)
 In Prayer.

16. Nay (behold), ye prefer
 The life of this world;

17. But the Hereafter
 Is better and more enduring.

18. And this is
 In the Books
 Of the earliest (Revelations),--

19. The Books of
 Abraham and Moses.



  

Sura LXXXVIII.

  

Gashiya, or The Overwhelming Event.



1. Has the story
 Reached thee, of
 The Overwhelming (Event)?

2. Some faces, that Day,
 Will be humiliated,

3. Labouring (hard), weary,--

4. The while they enter
 The Blazing Fire,--

5. The while they are given,
 To drink, of a bailing hot spring,

6. No food will there be
 For them but a bitter Dhari'

7. Which will neither nourish
 Nor satisfy hunger.

8. (Other) faces that Day
 Will be joyful,

9. Pleased with their Striving,--

10. In a Garden on high,

11. Where they shall hear
 No (word) of vanity:

12. Therein will be
 A bubbling spring:

13. Therein will be Thrones
 (Of dignity), raised on high,

14. Goblets placed (ready),

15. And Cushions set in rows,

16. And rich carpets
 (All) spread out.

17. Do they not look
 At the Camels,
 How they are made?--

18. And at the Sky,
 How it is raised high?--

19. And at the Mountains,
 How they are fixed firm?--

20. And at the Earth,
 How it is spread out?

21. Wherefore do thou give
 Admonition, for thou art
 One to admonish.

22. Thou art not one
 To manage (men's) affairs.

23. But if any turn away
 And reject God,--

24. God will punish him
 With a mighty Punishment,

25. For to Us will be
 Their Return;

26. Then it will be for Us
 To call them to account.



  

Sura LXXXIX.

  

Fajr, or The Break of Day.



1. By the Break of Day;

2. By the Nights twice five;

3. By the Even
 And Odd (contrasted);

4. And by the Night
 When it passeth away;--

5. Is there (not) in these
 An adjuration (or evidence)
 For those who understand?

6. Seest thou not
 How thy Lord dealt
 With the 'Ad (people),--

7. Of the (city of) Iram,
 With lofty pillars,

8. The like of which
 Were not produced
 In (all) the land?

9. And with the Thamud
 (People), who cut out
 (Huge) rocks in the-valley?--

10. And with Pharaoh,
 Lord of Stakes?

11. (All) these transgressed
 Beyond bounds in the lands.

12. And heaped therein
 Mischief (on mischief).

13. Therefore did thy Lord
 Pour on them a scourge
 Of diverse chastisements:

14. For thy Lord is
 (As a Guardian)
 On a watch-tower.

15. Now, as for man,
 When his Lord trieth him,
 Giving him honour and gifts,
 Then saith he, (puffed up),
 "My Lord hath honoured me"

16. But when he trieth him,
 Restricting his subsistence
 For him, then saith he
 (In despair), "My Lord
 Hath humiliated me I."

17. Nay, nay! But ye
 Honour not the orphans!

18. Nor do ye encourage
 One another
 To feed the poor!--

19. And ye devour Inheritance--
 All with greed,

20. And ye love wealth
 With inordinate love!

21. Nay! When the earth
 Is pounded to powder,

22. And thy Lord cometh,
 And His angels,
 Rank upon rank,

23. And Hell, that Day,
 Is brought (face to face),--
 On that Day will man
 Remember, but how will
 That remembrance profit him?

24. He will say: "Ah!
 Would that I had
 Sent forth (Good Deeds)
 For (this) my (Future) Life!"

25. For, that Day,
 His Chastisement will be

Such as none (else)
 Can inflict,

26. And His bonds
 Will be such as
 None (other) can bind.

27. (To the righteous soul
 Will be said:)
 "O (thou) soul,
 In (complete) rest
 And satisfaction!

28. "Come back thou
 To thy Lord,--
 Well pleased (thyself),
 And well-pleasing
 Unto Him!

29. "Enter thou, then,
 Among my Devotees!

30. "Yea, enter thou
 My Heaven!



  

Sura XC.

  

Balad, or The City.



1. I do call to witness
 This City;--

2. And thou art a freeman
 Of this City;--

3. And (the mystic ties
 of) Parent and Child;--

4. Verily We have created
 Man into toil and struggle.

5. Thinketh he, that none
 Hath power over him?

6. He may say (boastfully):
 "Wealth have I squandered
 In abundance!"

7. Thinketh he that none
 Beholdeth him?

8. Have We not made
 For him a pair of eyes?--

9. And a tongue,
 And a pair of lips?--

10. And shown him
 The two highways?

11. But he hath made no haste
 On the path that is steep.

12. And what will explain
 To thee the path that is steep?--

13. (It is:) freeing the bondman;

14. Or the giving of food
 In a day of privation

15. To the orphan
 With claims of relationship,

16. Or to the indigent
 (Down) in the dust.

17. Then will he be
 Of those who believe,
 And enjoin patience, (constancy,
 And self-restraint), and enjoin
 Deeds of kindness and compassion.

18. Such are the Companions
 Of the Right Hand.

19. But those who reject
 Our Signs, they are
 The (unhappy) Companions
 Of the Left Hand.

20. On them will be Fire
 Vaulted over (all round).



  

Sura XCI.

  

Shams, or The Sun.



1. By the Sun
 And his (glorious) splendour;

2. By the Moon
 As she follows him;

3. By the Day as it
 Shows up (the Sun's) glory;

4. By the Night as it
 Conceals it;

5. By the Firmament
 And its (wonderful) structure;

6. By the Earth
 And its (wide) expanse;

7. By the Soul,
 And the proportion and order
 Given to it;

8. And its enlightenment
 As to its wrong
 And its right;--

9. Truly he succeeds
 That purifies it,

10. And he fails
 That corrupts it!

11. The Thamud (people)
 Rejected (their prophet)
 Through their inordinate
 Wrong-doing.

12. Behold, the most wicked
 Man among them was
 Deputed (for impiety).

13. But the apostle of God
 Said to them: "It is

A She-camel of God!
 And (bar her not
 From) having her drink!"

14. Then they rejected him
 (As a false prophet),
 And they hamstrung her.
 So their Lord, on account
 Of their crime, obliterated
 Their traces and made them
 Equal (in destruction,
 High and low)!

15. And for Him
 Is no fear
 Of its consequences.



  

Sura XCII.

  

Lail, or The Night.



1. By the Night as it
 Conceals (the light);

2. By the Day as it
 Appears in glory;

3. By (the mystery of)
 The creation of male
 And female;--

4. Verily, (the ends) ye
 Strive for are diverse.

5. So he who gives
 (In charity) and fears (God),

6. And (in all sincerity)
 Testifies to the Best,--

7. We will indeed
 Make smooth for him
 The path to Bliss,

8. But he who is
 A greedy miser
 And thinks himself
 Self-sufficient,

9. And gives the lie
 To the Best,--

10. We will indeed
 Make smooth for him
 The Path to Misery;

11. Nor will his wealth
 Profit him when he
 Falls headlong (into the Pit).

12. Verily We take
 Upon Ourselves to guide,

13. And verily unto Us
 (Belong) the End
 And the Beginning,

14. Therefore do I warn you
 Of a Fire blazing fiercely;

15. None shall reach it
 But those most unfortunate ones

16. Who give the lie to Truth
 And turn their backs.

17. But those most devoted
 To God shall be
 Removed far from it,--

18. Those who spend their wealth
 For increase in self-purification,

19. And have in their minds
 No favour from anyone
 For which a reward
 Is expected in return,

20. But only the desire
 To seek for the Countenance
 Of their Lord Most High;

21. And soon will they
 Attain (complete) satisfaction.



  

Sura XCIII.

  

Dhuha, or The Glorious Morning Light.



1. By the Glorious
 Morning Light,

2. And by the Night
 When it is still,--

3. Thy Guardian-Lord
 Hath not forsaken thee,
 Nor is He displeased,

4. And verily the hereafter
 Will be better for thee
 Than the present.

5. And soon will thy
 Guardian-Lord give thee
 (That wherewith) thou
 Shalt be well-pleased.

6. Did He not find thee
 An orphan and give thee
 Shelter (and care)?

7. And He found thee
 Wandering, and He gave
 Thee guidance.

8. And He found thee
 In need, and made
 Thee independent.

9. Therefore, treat not
 The orphan with harshness,

10. Nor repulse the petitioner
 (Unheard);

11. But the Bounty
 Of thy Lord--
 Rehearse and proclaim!



  

Sura XCIV.

  

Inshirah, or The Expansion.



1. Have We not
 Expanded thee thy breast?--

2. And removed from thee
 Thy burden

3. The which did gall
 Thy back?--

4. And raised high the esteem
 (In which) thou (art held)?

5. So, verily,
 With every difficulty,
 There is relief:

6. Verily, with every difficulty
 There is relief.

7. Therefore, when thou art
 Free (from thine immediate task),
 Still labour hard,

8. And to thy Lord
 Turn (all) thy attention.



  

Sura XCV.

  

Tin, or The Fig.



1. By the Fig
 And the Olive,

2. And the Mount
 Of Sinai,

3. And this City
 Of security,--

4. We have  created man
 In the best of moulds,

5. Then do We abase him
 (To be) the lowest
 Of the low,--

6. Except such as believe
 And do righteous deeds:
 For they shall have
 A reward unfailing.

7. Then what can,
 After this, contradict thee
 As to the Judgment
 (To come)?

8. Is not God
 The wisest of Judges?



  

Sura XCVI.

  

Iqraa, or Read! or Proclaim! 



1. Proclaim! (or Read!)
 In the name
 Of thy Lord and Cherisher,
 Who created--

2. Created man, out of
 A (mere) clot
 Of congealed blood:

3. Proclaim! And thy Lord
 Is Most Bountiful,--

4. He Who taught
 (The use of) the Pen,--

5. Taught man that
 Which he knew not.

6. Nay, but man doth
 Transgress all bounds,

7. In that he looketh
 Upon himself as self-sufficient.

8. Verily, to thy Lord
 Is the return (of all).

9. Seest thou one
 Who forbids--

10. A votary when he
 (Turns) to pray?

11. Seest thou if
 He is on (the road
 Of) Guidance?--

12. Or enjoins Righteousness?

13. Seest thou if he
 Denies (Truth) and turns away?

14. Knoweth he not
 That God doth see?

15. Let him beware! If he
 Desist not, We will
 Drag him by the forelock,--

16. A lying, sinful forelock!

17. Then, let him call
 (For help) to his council
 (Of comrades):

18. We will call
 On the angels of punishment
 (To deal with him)!

19. Nay, heed him not:
 But bow down in adoration,
 And bring thyself
 The closer (to God)!



  

Sura XCVII.

  

Qadr, or The Night of Power (or Honour).



1. We have indeed revealed
 This (Message)
 In the Night of Power:

2. And what will explain
 To thee what the Night
 Of Power is?

3. The Night of Power
 Is better than
 A thousand Months,

4. Therein come dawn
 The angels and the Spirit
 By God's permission,
 On every errand:

5. Peace!...This
 Until the rise of Morn!



  

Sura XCVIII.

  

Baiyina, or The Clear Evidence.



1. Those who reject (Truth),
 Among the People of the Book
 And among the Polytheists,
 Were not going to depart
 (From their ways) until
 There should come to them
 Clear Evidence,--

2. An apostle from God,
 Rehearsing scriptures
 Kept pure and holy:

3. Wherein are laws (or decrees)
 Right and straight.

4. Nor did the People
 Of the Book

Make schisms,
 Until after there came
 To them Clear Evidence.

5. And they have been commanded
 No more than this:
 To worship God,
 Offering Him sincere devotion,
 Being True (in faith);
 To establish regular Prayer;
 And to practise regular Charity;
 And that is the Religion
 Right and Straight.

6. Those who reject (Truth),
 Among the People of the Book
 And among the Polytheists,
 Will be in hell-fire,
 To dwell therein (for aye).
 They are the worst
 Of creatures.

7. Those who have faith
 And do righteous deeds,--
 They are the best
 Of creatures.

8. Their reward is with God:
 Gardens of Eternity,
 Beneath which rivers flow;
 They will dwell therein
 For ever; God well pleased
 With them, and they with Him;
 All this for such as
 Fear their Lord and Cherisher.



  

Sura XCIX.

  

Zilzal, or The Convulsion.



1. When the Earth is
 Shaken to her (utmost)
 convulsion,

2. And the Earth throws up
 Her burdens (from within),

3. And man cries (distressed):
 "What is the matter with her?"--

4. On that Day will she
 Declare her tidings:

5. For that thy Lord will
 Have given her inspiration,

6. On that Day will men
 Proceed in companies sorted out,

To be shown the Deeds
 That they (had done).

7. Then shall anyone who
 Has done an atom's weight
 Of good, see it!

8. And anyone who
 Has done an atom's weight
 Of evil, shall see it.



  

Sura C.

  

'Adiyat, or Those that run.



1. By the (Steeds)
 That run, with panting (breath),

2. And strike sparks of fire,

3. And push home the charge
 In the morning,

4. And raise the dust
 In clouds the while,

5. And penetrate forthwith
 Into the midst (of the foe)
 En masse;--

6. Truly Man is,
 To his Lord,
 Ungrateful;

7. And to that (fact)
 He bears witness
 (By his deeds);

8. And violent is he
 In his love of wealth.

9. Does he not know,--
 When that which is
 In the graves is
 Scattered abroad

10. And that which is
 (Locked up) in (human) breasts
 Is made manifest--

11. That their Lord had been
 Well-acquainted with them,
 (Even to) that Day?



  

Sura CI.

  

Al-Qari'a, or The Day of Noise and Clamour.



1. The (Day) of
 Noise and Clamour:

2. What is the (Day)
 Of Noise and Clamour?

3. And what will explain
 To thee what the (Day)
 Of Noise and Clamour is?

4. (It is) a Day whereon
 Men will be like moths
 Scattered about,

5. And the mountains
 Will be like carded wool.

6. Then, he whose
 Balance (of good deeds)
 Will be (found) heavy,

7. Will be in a Life
 Of good pleasure and
 satisfaction.

8. But he whose
 Balance (of good deeds)
 Will be (found) light,--

9. Will have his home
 In a (bottomless) Pit.

10. And what will explain
 To thee what this is?

11. (It is) a Fire
 Blazing fiercely!



  

Sura CII.

  

Takathur or Piling Up.



1. The mutual rivalry
 For piling up (the good things
 Of this world) diverts you
 (From the more serious things),

2. Until ye visit the graves.

3. But nay, ye soon shall
 Know (the reality).

4. Again, ye soon shall know!

5. Nay, were ye to know
 With certainty of mind,
 (Ye would beware!)

6. Ye shall certainly see
 Hell-fire!

7. Again, ye shall see it
 With certainty of sight!

8. Then, shall ye be
 Questioned that Day
 About the joy
 (Ye indulged in!)

 Patience and Constancy.



  

Sura CIV.

  

Humaza, or the Scandal-monger.



1. Woe to every
 (Kind of) scandal-monger
 And backbiter,

2. Who pileth up wealth
 And layeth it by,

3. Thinking that his wealth
 Would make him last
 For ever!

4. By no means! He will
 Be sure to be thrown into
 That which Breaks to Pieces.

5. And what will explain
 To thee That which Breaks
 To Pieces?

6. (It is) the Fire
 Of (the Wrath of) God
 Kindled (to a blaze),

7. The which doth mount
 (Right) to the Hearts:

8. It shall be made
 Into a vault over them,

9. In columns outstretched.



  

Sura CV.

  

Fil, or The Elephant.



1. Seest thou not
 How thy Lord dealt
 With the Companions
 Of the Elephant?

2. Did He not make
 Their treacherous plan
 Go astray?

3. And He sent against them
 Flights of Birds,

4. Striking them with stones
 Of baked clay.

5. Then did He make them
 Like an empty field
 Of stalks and straw,
 (Of which the corn)
 Has been eaten up.

1. Seest thou one
 Who denies the Judgment
 (To come)?

 Who repulses the orphan
 (With harshness),

 The feeding of the indigent.

 To be seen (of men),

 (Even) neighbourly needs.

Kafirun, or Those who reject Faith.



1. Say: O ye
 That reject Faith!

 Which ye worship,

3. Nor will ye worship
 That which I worship.

 That which ye have been
 Wont to worship,

 That which I worship.

 And to me mine.

 Of palm-leaf fibre
 Round her (own) neck!

 With the Lord
 And Cherisher of Mankind,

2. The King (or Ruler)
 Of Mankind,

3. The God (or Judge)
 Of Mankind,--

4. From the mischief
 Of the Whisperer
 (Of Evil), who withdraws
 (After his whisper),--

5. (The same) who whispers
 Into the hearts of Mankind,--

6. Among Jinns
 And among Men.
