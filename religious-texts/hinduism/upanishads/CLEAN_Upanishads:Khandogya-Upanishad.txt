First Prapathaka
Section 1
First Khanda
1-1:1. Let a man meditate on the syllable Om, called the
udgitha; for the udgitha (a portion of the Samaveda) is sung, beginning with Om.
The full account, however, of Om is this:
1-1:2. The essence of all beings is the earth, the essence
of the earth is water, the essence of water the
plants, the essence of plants man, the essence of man
speech, the essence of speech the Rig-veda, the
essence of the Rig-veda the Sama-veda, the essence of
the Sama-veda the udgitha (which is Om).
1-1:3. That udgitha (Om) is the best of all essences, the
highest, deserving the highest place, the eighth.
1-1:4. What then is the Rik? What is the Saman? What
is the udgitha? This is the question.
1-1:5. The Rik indeed is speech, Saman is breath, the
udgitha is the syllable Om. Now speech and
breath, or Rik and Saman, form one couple.
1-1:6. And that couple is joined together in the syllable
Om. When two people come together, they fulfil
each other's desire.
1-1:7. Thus he who knowing this, meditates on the
syllable (Om), the udgitha, becomes indeed a fulfiller 
of desires.
1-1:8. That syllable is a syllable of permission, for
whenever we permit anything, we say Om, yes. Now
permission is gratification. He who knowing this
meditates on the syllable (Om), the udgitha, becomes
indeed a gratifier of desires.
1-1:9. By that syllable does the threefold knowledge (the
sacrifice, more particularly the Soma-sacrifice,
as founded on the three Vedas) proceed. When the
Adhvaryu priest gives an order, he says Om. When
the Hotri priest recites, he says Om. When the Udgatri
priest sings, he says Om, all for the glory of
that syllable. The threefold knowledge (the sacrifice)
proceeds by the greatness of that syllable (the vital
breaths), and by its essence (the oblations).
1-1:10. Now therefore it would seem to follow, that both
he who knows this (the true meaning of the
syllable Om), and he who does not, perform the same
sacrifice. But this is not so, for knowledge and
ignorance are different. The sacrifice which a man
performs with knowledge, faith, and the Upanishad is
more powerful. This is the full account of the syllable Om.
Section 2
Second Khanda
1-2:1. When the Devas and Asuras struggled together,
both of the race of Pragapati, the Devas took the
udgitha (Om), thinking they would vanquish the Asuras
with it.
1-2:2. They meditated on the udgitha (Om) as the breath
(scent) in the nose, but the Asuras pierced it (the
breath) with evil. Therefore we smell by the breath in the
nose both what is good-smelling and what is
bad-smelling. For the breath was pierced by evil.
1-2:3. Then they meditated on the udgitha (Om) as
speech, but the Asuras pierced it with evil. Therefore
we speak both truth and falsehood. For speech is
pierced by evil. 
1-2:4. Then they meditated on the udgitha (Om) as the
eye, but the Asuras pierced it with evil. Therefore
we see both what is sightly and unsightly. For the eye is
pierced by evil.
1-2:5. Then they meditated on the udgitha (Om) as the
ear, but the Asuras pierced it with evil. Therefore
we hear both what should be heard and what should not
be heard. For the ear is pierced by evil.
1-2:6. Then they meditated on the udgitha (Om) as the
mind, but the Asuras pierced it with evil.
Therefore we conceive both what should be conceived
and what should not be conceived. For the mind is
pierced by evil.
1-2:7. Then comes this breath (of life) in the mouth. They
meditated on the udgitha (Om) as that breath.
When the Asuras came to it, they were scattered, as (a
ball of earth) would be scattered when hitting a
solid stone.
1-2:8. Thus, as a ball of earth is scattered when hitting
on a solid stone, will he be scattered who wishes
evil to one who knows this, or who persecutes him; for he
is a solid stone.
1-2:9. By it (the breath in the mouth) he distinguishes
neither what is good nor what is bad-smelling, for
that breath is free from evil. What we eat and drink with it
supports the other vital breaths (i.e. the
senses, such as smell, &c.) When at the time of death he
does not find that breath (in the mouth, through
which he eats and drinks lives), then he departs. He
opens the mouth at the time of death (as if wishing to
eat).
1-2:10. Angiras meditated on the udgitha (Om) as that
breath, and people hold it to be Angiras, i.e. the
essence of the members (anganam rasah);
1-2:11. Therefore Brihaspati meditated on udgitha (Om)
as that breath, and people hold it to be
Brihaspati, for speech is brihati, and he (that breath) is
the lord (pati) of speech; 
1-2:12. Therefore Ayasya meditated on the udgitha (Om)
as that breath, and people hold it to be Ayasya,
because it comes (ayati) from the mouth (asya);
1-2:13. Therefore Vaka Dalbhya knew it. He was the
Udgatri (singer) of the Naimishiya-sacrificers, and
by singing he obtained for them their wishes.
1-2:14. He who knows this, and meditates on the syllable
Om (the imperishable udgitha) as the breath of
life in the mouth, he obtains all wishes by singing. So
much for the udgitha (Om) as meditated on with
reference to the body.
Section 3
Third Khanda
1-3:1. Now follows the meditation on the udgitha with
reference to the gods. Let a man meditate on the
udgitha (Om) as he who sends warmth (the sun in the
sky). When the sun rises it sings as Udgatri for the
sake of all creatures. When it rises it destroys the fear of
darkness. He who knows this, is able to destroy
the fear of darkness (ignorance).
1-3:2. This (the breath in the mouth) and that (the sun)
are the same. This is hot and that is hot. This
they call svara (sound), and that they call pratyasvara
(reflected sound). Therefore let a man meditate on
the udgitha (Om) as this and that (as breath and as sun).
1-3:3. Then let a man meditate on the udgitha (Om) as
vyana indeed. If we breathe up, that is prana, the
up-breathing. If we breathe down, that is apana, the
down-breathing. The combination of prana and
apana is vyana, back-breathing or holding in of the
breath. This vyana is speech. Therefore when we
utter speech, we neither breathe up nor down.
1-3:4. Speech is Rik, and therefore when a man utters a
Rik verse he neither breathes up nor down.
Rik is Saman, and therefore when a man utters a
Saman verse he neither breathes up nor down. 
Saman is udgitha, and therefore when a man sings (the
udgitha, Om) he neither breathes up nor down.
1-3:5. And other works also which require strength, such
as the production of fire by rubbing, running a
race, stringing a strong bow, are performed without
breathing up or down. Therefore let a man meditate
on the udgitha (Om) as vyana.
1-3:6. Let a man meditate on the syllables of the udgitha,
i.e. of the word udgitha. Ut is breath (prana),
for by means of breath a man rises (uttishthati). Gi is
speech, for speeches are called girah. Tha is food,
for by means of food all subsists (sthita).
1-3:7. Ut is heaven, gi the sky, tha the earth. Ut is the
sun, gi the air, tha the fire. Ut is the Sama-veda, gi
the Yagur-veda, tha the Rig-veda.
Speech yields the milk, which is the milk of speech itself,
to him who thus knowing meditates on those
syllables of the name of udgitha, he becomes rich in food
and able to eat food.
1-3:8. Next follows the fulfilment of prayers. Let a man
thus meditate on the Upasaranas, i.e. the objects
which have to be approached by meditation: Let him (the
Udgatri) quickly reflect on the Saman with
which he is going to praise;
1-3:9. Let him quickly reflect on the Rik in which that
Saman occurs; on the Rishi (poet) by whom it was
seen or composed; on the Devata (object) which he is
going to praise;
1-3:10. On the metre in which he is going to praise; on
the tune with which he is going to sing for
himself;
1-3:11. On the quarter of the world which he is going to
praise. Lastly, having approached himself (his
name, family, &c.) by meditation, let him sing the hymn of
praise, reflecting on his desire, and avoiding
all mistakes in pronunciation, &c. Quickly will the desire
be then fulfilled to him, for the sake of which he 
may have offered his hymn of praise, yea, for which he
may have offered his hymn of praise.
Section 4
Fourth Khanda
1-4:1. Let a man meditate on the syllable Om, for the
udgitha is sung beginning with Om. And this is
the full account of the syllable Om:
1-4:2. The Devas, being afraid of death, entered upon
(the performance of the sacrifice prescribed in) the
threefold knowledge (the three Vedas). They covered
themselves with the metrical hymns. Because they
covered (khad) themselves with the hymns, therefore the
hymns are called khandas.
1-4:3. Then, as a fisherman might observe a fish in the
water, Death observed the Devas in the Rik,
Yagus, and Saman-(sacrifices). And the Devas seeing
this, rose from the Rik, Yagus, and Samansacrifices, and entered the Svara, i.e. the Om (they
meditated on the Om).
1-4:4. When a man has mastered the Rig-veda, he says
quite loud Om; the same, when he has mastered
the Saman and the Yagus. This Svara is the
imperishable (syllable), the immortal, free from fear.
Because the Devas entered it, therefore they became
immortal, and free from fear.
1-4:5. He who knowing this loudly pronounces (pranauti)
that syllable, enters the same (imperishable)
syllable, the Svara, the immortal, free from fear, and
having entered it, becomes immortal, as the Devas
are immortal.
Section 5
Fifth Khanda
1-5:1. The udgitha is the pranava, the pranava is the
udgitha. And as the udgitha is the sun, so is the
pranava, for he (the sun) goes sounding Om. 
1-5:2. `Him I sang praises to, therefore art thou my only
one,' thus said Kaushitaki to his son. `Do thou
revolve his rays, then thou wilt have many sons.' So
much in reference to the Devas.
1-5:3. Now with reference to the body. Let a man
meditate on the udgitha as the breath (in the mouth),
for he goes sounding Om.
1-5:4. `Him I sang praises to, therefore art thou my only
son,' thus said Kaushitaki to his son. `Do thou
therefore sing praises to the breath as manifold, if thou
wishest to have many sons.'
1-5:5. He who knows that the udgitha is the pranava, and
the pranava the udgitha, rectifies from the seat
of the Hotri priest any mistake committed by the Udgatri
priest in performing the udgitha, yea, in
performing the udgitha.
Section 6
Sixth Khanda
1-6:1. The Rik (veda) is this earth, the Saman (veda) is
fire. This Saman (fire) rests on that Rik (earth).
Therefore the Saman is sung as resting on the Rik. Sa is
this earth, ama is fire, and that makes Sama.
1-6:2. The Rik is the sky, the Saman air. This Saman
(air) rests on that Rik (sky). Therefore the Saman
is sung as resting on the Rik. Sa is the sky, ama the air,
and that makes Sama.
1-6:3. Rik is heaven, Saman the sun. This Saman (sun)
rests on that Rik (heaven). Therefore the Saman
is sung as resting on the Rik. Sa is heaven, ama the sun,
and that makes Sama.
1-6:4. Rik is the stars, Saman the moon. This Saman
(moon) rests on that Rik (stars). Therefore the
Saman is sung as resting on the Rik. Sa is the stars, ama
the moon, and that makes Sama.
1-6:5. Rik is the white light of the sun, Saman the blue
exceeding darkness (in the sun). This Saman 
(darkness) rests on that Rik (brightness). Therefore the
Saman is sung as resting on the Rik.
1-6:6. Sa is the white light of the sun, ama the blue
exceeding darkness, and that makes Sama.
Now that golden person, who is seen within the sun,
with golden beard and golden hair, golden
altogether to the very tips of his nails,
1-6:7. Whose eyes are like blue lotus's, his name is ut,
for he has risen (udita) above all evil. He also who
knows this, rises above all evil.
1-6:8. Rik and Saman are his joints, and therefore he is
udgitha. And therefore he who praises him (the
ut) is called the Ud-gatri (the out-singer). He (the golden
person, called ut) is lord of the worlds beyond
that (sun), and of all the wishes of the Devas (inhabiting
those worlds). So much with reference to the
Devas.
Section 7
Seventh Khanda
1-7:1. Now with reference to the body. Rik is speech,
Saman breath. This Saman (breath) rests on that
Rik (speech). Therefore the Saman is sung as resting on
the Rik. Sa is speech, ama is breath, and that
makes Sama.
1-7:2. Rik is the eye, Saman the self. This Saman
(shadow) rests on that Rik (eye). Therefore the Saman
is sung as resting on the Rik. Sa is the eye, ama the self,
and that makes Sama.
1-7:3. Rik is the ear, Saman the mind. This Saman
(mind) rests on that Rik (ear). Therefore the Saman
is sung as resting on the Rik. Sa is the ear, ama the
mind, and that makes Sama.
1-7:4. Rik is the white light of the eye, Saman the blue
exceeding darkness. This Saman (darkness) rests
on the Rik (brightness). Therefore the Saman is sung as
resting on the Rik. Sa is the white light of the 
eye, ama the blue exceeding darkness, and that makes
Sama.
1-7:5. Now the person who is seen in the eye, he is Rik,
he is Saman, Uktha, Yagus, Brahman. The form
of that person (in the eye) is the same as the form of the
other person (in the sun), the joints of the one
(Rik and Saman) are the joints of the other, the name of
the one (ut) is the name of the other.
1-7:6. He is lord of the worlds beneath that (the self in
the eye), and of all the wishes of men. Therefore
all who sing to the vina (lyre), sing him, and from him also
they obtain wealth.
1-7:7. He who knowing this sings a Saman, sings to both
(the adhidaivata and adhyatma self, the person
in the sun and the person in the eye, as one and the
same person). He obtains through the one, yea, he
obtains the worlds beyond that, and the wishes of the
Devas;
1-7:8. And he obtains through the other the worlds
beneath that, and the wishes of men.
Therefore an Udgatri priest who knows this, may say (to
the sacrificer for whom he officiates);
1-7:9. `What wish shall I obtain for you by my songs?'
For he who knowing this sings a Saman is able to
obtain wishes through his song, yea, through his song.
Section 8
Eighth Khanda
1-8:1. There were once three men, well-versed in
udgitha, Silaka Salavatya, Kaikitayana Dalbhya, and
Pravahana Gaivali. They said: `We are well-versed in
udgitha. Let us have a discussion on udgitha.'
1-8:2. They all agreed and sat down. Then Pravahana
Gaivali said: `Sirs, do you both speak first, for I
wish to hear what two Brahmanas have to say.'
1-8:3. Then Silaka Salavatya said to Kaikitayana
Dalbhya: `Let me ask you.'
`Ask,' he replied.
1-8:4. `What is the origin of the Saman?' `Tone (svara),'
he replied.
`What is the origin of tone?' `Breath,' he replied.
`What is the origin of breath?' `Food,' he replied.
`What is the origin of food?' `Water,' he replied.
1-8:5. `What is the origin of water?' `That world
(heaven),' he replied.
`And what is the origin of that world?'
He replied: `Let no man carry the Saman beyond the
world of svarga (heaven). We place (recognise) the
Saman in the world of svarga, for the Saman is extolled
as svarga (heaven).'
1-8:6. Then said Silaka Salavatya to Kaikitayana
Dalbhya: `O Dalbhya, thy Saman is not firmly
established. And if any one were to say, Your head shall
fall off (if you be wrong), surely your head would
now fall.'
1-8:7. `Well then, let me know this from you, Sir,' said
Dalbhya.
`Know it,' replied Silaka Salavatya.
`What is the origin of that world (heaven)?' `This world,'
he replied.
`And what is the origin of this world?'
He replied: `Let no man carry the Saman beyond this
world as its rest. We place the Saman in this world
as its rest, for the Saman is extolled as rest.'
1-8:8. Then said Pravahana Gaivali to Silaka Salavatya:
`Your Saman (the earth), O Salavatya, has an 
end. And if any one were to say, Your head shall fall off
(if you be wrong), surely your head would now
fall.'
`Well then, let me know this from you, Sir,' said
Salavatya.
`Know it,' replied Gaivali.
Section 9
Ninth Khanda
1-9:1. `What is the origin of this world?' `Ether,' he
replied. For all these beings take their rise from the
ether, and return into the ether. Ether is older than these,
ether is their rest.
1-9:2. He is indeed the udgitha (Om = Brahman), greater
than great (parovariyas), he is without end.
He who knowing this meditates on the udgitha, the
greater than great, obtains what is greater than great,
he conquers the worlds which are greater than great.
1-9:3. Atidhanvan Saunaka, having taught this udgitha to
Udara-sandilya, said: `As long as they will
know in your family this udgitha, their life in this world will
be greater than great.
1-9:4. `And thus also will be their state in the other world.'
He who thus knows the udgitha, and
meditates on it thus, his life in this world will be greater
than great, and also his state in the other world,
yea, in the other world.
Section 10
Tenth Khanda
1-10:1. When the Kurus had been destroyed by (hail)
stones, Ushasti Kakrayana lived as a beggar with
his virgin wife at Ibhyagrama.
1-10:2. Seeing a chief eating beans, he begged of him.
The chief said: `I have no more, except those 
which are put away for me here.'
1-10:3. Ushasti said: `Give me to eat of them.' He gave
him the beans, and said: `There is something to
drink also.' Then said Ushasti: `If I drank of it, I should
have drunk what was left by another, and is
therefore unclean.'
1-10:4. The chief said: `Were not those beans also left
over and therefore unclean?'
`No,' he replied; `for I should not have lived, if I had not
eaten them, but the drinking of water would be
mere pleasure.'
1-10:5. Having eaten himself, Ushasti gave the
remaining beans to his wife. But she, having eaten
before, took them and put them away.
1-10:6. Rising the next morning, Ushasti said to her:
`Alas, if we could only get some food, we might
gain a little wealth. The king here is going to offer a
sacrifice, he should choose me for all the priestly
offices.'
1-10:7. His wife said to him: `Look, here are those beans
of yours.' Having eaten them, he went to the
sacrifice which was being performed.
1-10:8. He went and sat down on the orchestra near the
Udgatris, who were going to sing their hymns of
praise. And he said to the Prastotri (the leader):
1-10:9. `Prastotri, if you, without knowing the deity which
belongs to the prastava (the hymns &c. of the
Prastotri), are going to sing it, your head will fall off.'
1-10:10. In the same manner he addressed the Udgatri:
`Udgatri, if you, without knowing the deity which
belongs to the udgitha (the hymns of the Udgatri), are
going to sing it, your head will fall off.'
1-10:11. In the same manner he addressed the
Pratihartri: `Pratihartri, if you, without knowing the deity
which belongs to the pratihara (the hymns of the
Pratihartri), are going to sing it, your head will fall off.' 
They stopped, and sat down in silence.
Section 11
Eleventh Khanda
1-11:1. Then the sacrificer said to him: `I should like to
know who you are, Sir.' He replied: `I am
Ushasti Kakrayana.'
1-11:2. He said: `I looked for you, Sir, for all these
sacrificial offices, but not finding you, I chose others.'
1-11:3. `But now, Sir, take all the sacrificial offices.'
Ushasti said: `Very well; but let those, with my
permission, perform the hymns of praise. Only as much
wealth as you give to them, so much give to me also.'
The sacrificer assented.
1-11:4. Then the Prastotri approached him, saying: `Sir,
you said to me, "Prastotri, if you, without
knowing the deity which belongs to the prastava, are
going to sing it, your head will fall off," which
then is that deity?'
1-11:5. He said: `Breath (prana). For all these beings
merge into breath alone, and from breath they
arise. This is the deity belonging to the prastava. If,
without knowing that deity, you had sung forth your
hymns, your head would have fallen off, after you had
been warned by me.'
1-11:6. Then the Udgatri approached him, saying: `Sir,
you said to me, "Udgatri, if you, without knowing
the deity which belongs to the udgitha, are going to sing
it, your head will fall off," which then is that
deity?'
1-11:7. He said: `The sun (Aditya). For all these beings
praise the sun when it stands on high. This is
the deity belonging to the udgitha. If, without knowing
that deity, you had sung out your hymns, your 
head would have fallen off, after you had been warned by
me.'
1-11:8. Then the Pratihartri approached him, saying: `Sir,
you said to me, "Pratihartri, if you, without
knowing the deity belonging to the pratihara, are going to
sing it, your head will fall off," which then
is that deity?'
1-11:9. He said: `Food (anna). For all these beings live
when they partake of food. This is the deity
belonging to the pratihara. If, without knowing that deity,
you had sung your hymns, your head would
have fallen off, after you had been warned by me.'
Section 12
Twelfth Khanda
1-12:1. Now follows the udgitha of the dogs. Vaka
Dalbhya, or, as he was also called, Glava Maitreya,
went out to repeat the Veda (in a quiet place).
1-12:2. A white (dog) appeared before him, and other
dogs gathering round him, said to him: `Sir, sing
and get us food, we are hungry.'
1-12:3. The white dog said to them: `Come to me tomorrow morning.' Vaka Dalbhya, or, as he was also
called, Glava Maitreya, watched.
1-12:4. The dogs came on, holding together, each dog
keeping the tail of the preceding dog in his mouth,
as the priests do when they are going to sing praises with
the Vahishpavamana hymn. After they had
settled down, they began to say Hin.
1-12:5. `Om, let us eat! Om, let us drink! Om, may the
divine Varuna, Pragapati, Savitri bring us food!
Lord of food, bring hither food, bring it, Om!'
Section 13
Thirteenth Khanda
1-13:1. The syllable Hau is this world (the earth), the
syllable Hai the air, the syllable Atha the moon, the
syllable Iha the self, the syllable I is Agni, fire.
1-13:2. The syllable U is the sun, the syllable E is the
Nihava or invocation, the syllable Auhoi is the
Visve Devas, the syllable Hin is Pragapati, Svara (tone) is
breath (prana), the syllable Ya is food, the
syllable Vag is Virag.
1-13:3. The thirteenth stobha syllable, viz. the indistinct
syllable Hun, is the Undefinable (the Highest
Brahman).
1-13:4. Speech yields the milk, which is the milk of
speech itself to him who knows this Upanishad
(secret doctrine) of the Samans in this wise. He becomes
rich in food, and able to eat food, yea, able to
eat food.

~ Chapter 2 ~
Second Prapathaka
Section 1
First Khanda
2-1:1. Meditation on the whole of the Saman is good, and
people, when anything is good, say it is Saman;
when it is not good, it is not Saman.
2-1:2. Thus they also say, he approached him with
Saman, i.e. becomingly; and he approached him
without Saman, i.e. unbecomingly.
2-1:3. And they also say, truly this is Saman for us, i.e. it
is good for us, when it is good; and truly that is
not Saman for us, i.e. it is not good for us, when it is not
good.
2-1:4. If any one knowing this meditates on the Saman
as good, depend upon it all good qualities will
approach quickly, aye, they will become his own. 
Section 2
Second Khanda
2-2:1. Let a man meditate on the fivefold Saman as the
five worlds. The hinkara is the earth, the
prastava the fire, the udgitha the sky, the pratihara the
sun, the nidhana heaven; so in an ascending line.
2-2:2. In a descending line, the hinkara is heaven, the
prastava the sun, the udgitha the sky, the pratihara
the fire, the nidhana the earth.
2-2:3. The worlds in an ascending and in a descending
line belong to him who knowing this meditates on
the fivefold Saman as the worlds.
Section 3
Third Khanda
2-3:1. Let a man meditate on the fivefold Saman as rain.
The hinkara is wind (that brings the rain); the
prastava is, `the cloud is come;' the udgitha is, `it rains;'
the pratihara, `it flashes, it thunders;'
2-3:2. The nidhana is, `it stops.' There is rain for him,
and he brings rain for others who thus knowing
meditates on the fivefold Saman as rain.
Section 4
Fourth Khanda
2-4:1. Let a man meditate on the fivefold Saman in all
waters. When the clouds gather, that is the
hinkara; when it rains, that is the prastava; that which
flows in the east, that is the udgitha; that which
flows in the west, that is the pratihara; the sea is the
nidhana.
2-4:2. He does not die in water, nay, he is rich in water
who knowing this meditates on the fivefold
Saman as all waters. 
Section 5
Fifth Khanda
2-5:1. Let a man meditate on the fivefold Saman as the
seasons. The hinkara is spring, the prastava
summer (harvest of yava, &c.), the udgitha the rainy
season, the pratihara autumn, the nidhana winter.
2-5:2. The seasons belong to him, nay, he is always in
season (successful) who knowing this meditates on
the fivefold Saman as the seasons.
Section 6
Sixth Khanda
2-6:1. Let a man meditate on the fivefold Saman in
animals. The hinkara is goats, the prastava sheep,
the udgitha cows, the pratihara horses, the nidhana man.
2-6:2. Animals belong to him, nay, he is rich in animals
who knowing this meditates on the fivefold
Saman as animals.
Section 7
Seventh Khanda
2-7:1. Let a man meditate on the fivefold Saman, which
is greater than great, as the pranas (senses). The
hinkara is smell (nose), the prastava speech (tongue), the
udgitha sight (eye), the pratihara hearing (ear),
the nidhana mind. These are one greater than the other.
2-7:2. What is greater than great belongs to him, nay, he
conquers the worlds which are greater than
great, who knowing this meditates on the fivefold Saman,
which is greater than great, as the pranas
(senses).
Section 8
Eighth Khanda
2-8:1. Next for the sevenfold Saman. Let a man
meditate on the sevenfold Saman in speech. Whenever
there is in speech the syllable hun, that is hinkara, pra is
the prastava, a is the adi, the first, i.e. Om,
2-8:2. Ud is the udgitha, pra the pratihara, upa the
upadrava, ni the nidhana.
2-8:3. Speech yields the milk, which is the milk of speech
itself, to him who knowing this meditates on
the sevenfold Saman in speech. He becomes rich in
food, and able to eat food.
Section 9
Ninth Khanda
2-9:1. Let a man meditate on the sevenfold Saman as
the sun. The sun is Saman, because he is always
the same (sama); he is Saman because he is the same,
everybody thinking he looks towards me, he looks
towards me.
2-9:2. Let him know that all beings are dependent on him
(the sun). What he is before his rising, that is
the hinkara. On it animals are dependent. Therefore
animals say hin (before sunrise), for they share the
hinkara of that Saman (the sun).
2-9:3. What he is when first risen, that is the prastava.
On it men are dependent. Therefore men love
praise (prastuti) and celebrity, for they share the prastava
of that Saman.
2-9:4. What he is at the time of the sangava, that is the
adi, the first, the Om. On it birds are dependent.
Therefore birds fly about in the sky without support,
holding themselves, for they share the adi (the Om)
of that Saman.
2-9:5. What he is just at noon, that is the udgitha. On it
the Devas are dependent (because they are
brilliant). Therefore they are the best of all the
descendants of Pragapati, for they share the udgitha of
that
Saman. 
2-9:6. What he is after midday and before afternoon, that
is the pratihara. On it all germs are dependent.
Therefore these, having been conceived (pratihrita), do
not fall, for they share the pratihara of that Saman.
2-9:7. What he is after the afternoon and before sunset,
that is the upadrava. On it the animals of the
forest are dependent. Therefore, when they see a man,
they run (upadravanti) to the forest as a safe
hiding-place, for they share the upadrava of that Saman.
2-9:8. What he is when he first sets, that is the nidhana.
On it the fathers are dependent. Therefore they
put them down (nidadhati), for they share the nidhana of
that Saman. Thus a man meditates on the
sevenfold Saman as the sun.
Section 10
Tenth Khanda
2-10:1. Next let a man meditate on the sevenfold Saman
which is uniform in itself and leads beyond
death. The word hinkara has three syllables, the word
prastava has three syllables: that is equal (sama).
2-10:2. The word adi (first, Om) has two syllables, the
word pratihara has four syllables. Taking one
syllable from that over, that is equal (sama).
2-10:3. The word udgitha has three syllables, the word
upadrava has four syllables. With three and three
syllables it should be equal. One syllable being left over,
it becomes trisyllabic. Hence it is equal.
2-10:4. The word nidhana has three syllables, therefore it
is equal. These make twenty-two syllables.
2-10:5. With twenty-one syllables a man reaches the sun
(and death), for the sun is the twenty-first from
here; with the twenty-second he conquers what is beyond
the sun: that is blessedness, that is freedom from
grief.
2-10:6. He obtains here the victory over the sun (death),
and there is a higher victory than the victory
over the sun for him, who knowing this meditates on the
sevenfold Saman as uniform in itself, which
leads beyond death, yea, which leads beyond death.
Section 11
Eleventh Khanda
2-11:1. The hinkara is mind, the prastava speech, the
udgitha sight, the pratihara hearing, the nidhana
breath. That is the Gayatra Saman, as interwoven in the
(five) pranas.
2-11:2. He who thus knows this Gayatra interwoven in
the pranas, keeps his senses, reaches the full life,
he lives long, becomes great with children and cattle,
great by fame. The rule of him who thus meditates
on the Gayatra is, `Be not high-minded.'
Section 12
Twelfth Khanda
2-12:1. The hinkara is, he rubs (the fire-stick); the
prastava, smoke rises; the udgitha, it burns; the
pratihara, there are glowing coals; the nidhana, it goes
down; the nidhana, it is gone out. This is the
Rathantara Saman as interwoven in fire.
2-12:2. He who thus knows this Rathantara interwoven in
fire, becomes radiant and strong. He reaches
the full life, he lives long, becomes great with children and
cattle, great by fame. The rule is, `Do not
rinse the mouth or spit before the fire.'
Section 13
Thirteenth Khanda
2-13:1. 2. Next follows the Vamadevya as interwoven in
generation.
Section 14 
Fourteenth Khanda
2-14:1. Rising, the sun is the hinkara, risen, he is the
prastava, at noon he is the udgitha, in the afternoon
he is the pratihara, setting, he is the nidhana. That is the
Brihat Saman as interwoven in the sun.
2-14:2. He who thus knows the Brihat as interwoven in
the sun, becomes refulgent and strong, he reaches
the full life, he lives long, becomes great with children and
cattle, great by fame. His rule is, `Never
complain of the heat of the sun.'
Section 15
Fifteenth Khanda
2-15:1. The mists gather, that is the hinkara; the cloud
has risen, that is the prastava; it rains, that is the
udgitha; it flashes and thunders, that is the pratihara; it
stops, that is the nidhana. That is the Vairupa
Saman, as interwoven in Parganya, the god of rain.
2-15:2. He who thus knows the Vairupa as interwoven in
Parganya, obtains all kinds of cattle (virupa), he
reaches the full life, he lives long, becomes great with
children and cattle, great by fame. His rule is,
`Never complain of the rain.'
Section 16
Sixteenth Khanda
2-16:1. The hinkara is spring, the prastava summer, the
udgitha the rainy season, the pratihara autumn,
the nidhana winter. That is the Vairaga Saman, as
interwoven in the seasons.
2-16:2. He who thus knows the Vairaga, as interwoven in
the seasons, shines (viragati) through children,
cattle, and glory of countenance. He reaches the full life,
he lives long, becomes great with children and
cattle, great by fame. His rule is, `Never complain of the
seasons.'
Section 17 
Seventeenth Khanda
2-17:1. The hinkara is the earth, the prastava the sky, the
udgitha heaven, the pratihara the regions, the
nidhana the sea. These are the Sakvari Samans, as
interwoven in the worlds.
2-17:2. He who thus knows the Sakvaris, as interwoven
in the worlds, becomes possessed of the worlds,
he reaches the full life, he lives long, becomes great with
children and cattle, great by fame. His rule is,
`Never complain of the worlds.'
Section 18
Eighteenth Khanda
2-18:1. The hinkara is goats, the prastava sheep, the
udgitha cows, the pratihara horses, the nidhana
man. These are the Revati Samans, as interwoven in
animals.
2-18:2. He who thus knows these Revatis, as interwoven
in animals, becomes rich in animals, he reaches
the full life, he lives long, becomes great with children and
cattle, great by fame. His rule is, `Never
complain of animals.'
Section 19
Nineteenth Khanda
2-19:1. The hinkara is hair, the prastava skin, the udgitha
flesh, the pratihara bone, the nidhana marrow.
That is the Yagnayagniya Saman, as interwoven in the
members of the body.
2-19:2. He who thus knows the Yagnayagniya, as
interwoven in the members of the body, becomes
possessed of strong limbs, he is not crippled in any limb,
he reaches the full life, he lives long, becomes
great with children and cattle, great by fame. His rule is,
`Do not eat marrow for a year,' or `Do not eat
marrow at all.' 
Section 20
Twentieth Khanda
2-20:1. The hinkara is fire, the prastava air, the udgitha
the sun, the pratihara the stars, the nidhana the
moon. That is the Ragana Saman, as interwoven in the
deities.
2-20:2. He who thus knows the Ragana, as interwoven in
the deities, obtains the same world, the same
happiness, the same company as the gods, he reaches
the full life, he lives long, becomes great with
children and cattle, great by fame. His rule is, `Do not
speak evil of the Brahmanas.'
Section 21
Twenty-First Khanda
2-21:1. The hinkara is the threefold knowledge, the
prastava these three worlds, the udgitha Agni (fire),
Vayu (air), and Aditya (sun), the pratihara the stars, the
birds, and the rays, the nidhana the serpents,
Gandharvas, and fathers. That is the Saman, as
interwoven in everything.
2-21:2. He who thus knows this Saman, as interwoven in
everything, he becomes everything.
2-21:3. And thus it is said in the following verse: `There
are the fivefold three (the three kinds of
sacrificial knowledge, the three worlds &c. in their fivefold
form, i.e. as identified with the hinkara, the
prastava, &c.), and the other forms of the Saman.
Greater than these there is nothing else besides.'
2-21:4. He who knows this, knows everything. All
regions offer him gifts. His rule is, `Let him meditate
(on the Saman), knowing that he is everything, yea, that
he is everything.'
Section 22
Twenty-Second Khanda 
2-22:1. The udgitha, of which a poet said, I choose the
deep sounding note of the Saman as good for
cattle, belongs to Agni; the indefinite note belongs to
Pragapati, the definite note to Soma, the soft and
smooth note to Vayu, the smooth and strong note to
Indra, the heron-like note to Brihaspati, the dull note
to Varuna. Let a man cultivate all of these, avoiding,
however, that of Varuna.
2-22:2. Let a man sing, wishing to obtain by his song
immortality for the Devas. `May I obtain by my
song oblations (svadha) for the fathers, hope for men,
fodder and water for animals, heaven for the
sacrificer, food for myself,' thus reflecting on these in his
mind, let a man (Udgatri priest) sing praises,
without making mistakes in pronunciation, &c.
2-22:3. All vowels (svara) belong to Indra, all sibilants
(ushman) to Pragapati, all consonants (sparsa) to
Mrityu (death). If somebody should reprove him for his
vowels, let him say, `I went to Indra as my refuge
(when pronouncing my vowels): he will answer thee.'
2-22:4. And if somebody should reprove him for his
sibilants, let him say, `I went to Pragapati as my
refuge: he will smash thee.' And if somebody should
reprove him for his consonants, let him say, `I went
to Mrityu as my refuge: he will reduce thee to ashes.'
2-22:5. All vowels are to be pronounced with voice
(ghosha) and strength (bala), so that the Udgatri may
give strength to Indra. All sibilants are to be pronounced,
neither as if swallowed (agrasta), nor as if
thrown out (nirasta), but well opened (vivrita), so that the
Udgatri may give himself to Pragapati. All
consonants are to be pronounced slowly, and without
crowding them together, so that the Udgatri may
withdraw himself from Mrityu.
Section 23
Twenty-Third Khanda
2-23:1. There are three branches of the law. Sacrifice,
study, and charity are the first, 
2-23:2. Austerity the second, and to dwell as a
Brahmakarin in the house of a tutor, always mortifying the
body in the house of a tutor, is the third. All these obtain
the worlds of the blessed; but the
Brahmasamstha alone (he who is firmly grounded in
Brahman) obtains immortality.
2-23:3. Pragapati brooded on the worlds. From them,
thus brooded on, the threefold knowledge
(sacrifice) issued forth. He brooded on it, and from it,
thus brooded on, issued the three syllables, Bhuh,
Bhuvah, Svah.
2-23:4. He brooded on them, and from them, thus
brooded on, issued the Om. As all leaves are attached
to a stalk, so is all speech (all words) attached to the Om
(Brahman). Om is all this, yea, Om is all this.
Section 24
Twenty-Fourth Khanda
2-24:1. The teachers of Brahman (Veda) declare, as the
Pratah-savana (morning-oblation) belongs to the
Vasus, the Madhyandina-savana (noon-libation) to the
Rudras, the third Savana (evening-libation) to the
Adityas and the Visve Devas,
2-24:2. Where then is the world of the sacrificer? He
who does not know this, how can he perform the
sacrifice? He only who knows, should perform it.
2-24:3. Before the beginning of the Prataranuvaka
(matin-chant), the sacrificer, sitting down behind the
household altar (garhapatya), and looking towards the
north, sings the Saman, addressed to the Vasus:
2-24:4. `Open the door of the world (the earth), let us see
thee, that we may rule (on earth).'
2-24:5. Then he sacrifices, saying: `Adoration to Agni,
who dwells on the earth, who dwells in the world!
Obtain that world for me, the sacrificer! That is the world
for the sacrificer!'
2-24:6. `I (the sacrificer) shall go thither, when this life is
over. Take this! (he says, in offering the
libation.) Cast back the bolt!' Having said this, he rises.
For him the Vasus fulfil the morning-oblation.
2-24:7. Before the beginning of the Madhyandinasavana, the noon-oblation, the sacrificer, sitting down
behind the Agnidhriya altar, and looking towards the
north, sings the Saman, addressed to the Rudras:
2-24:8. `Open the door of the world (the sky), let us see
thee, that we may rule wide (in the sky).'
2-24:9. Then he sacrifices, saying: `Adoration to Vayu
(air), who dwells in the sky, who dwells in the
world. Obtain that world for me, the sacrificer! That is the
world for the sacrificer!'
2-24:10. `I (the sacrificer) shall go thither, when this life is
over. Take this! Cast back the bolt!' Having
said this, he rises. For him the Rudras fulfil the noonoblation.
2-24:11. Before the beginning of the third oblation, the
sacrificer, sitting down behind the Ahavaniya
altar, and looking towards the north, sings the Saman,
addressed to the Adityas and Visve Devas:
2-24:12. `Open the door of the world (the heaven), let us
see thee, that we may rule supreme (in heaven).'
This is addressed to the Adityas.
2-24:13. Next the Saman addressed to the Visve Devas:
`Open the door of the world (heaven), let us see
thee, that we may rule supreme (in heaven).'
2-24:14. Then he sacrifices, saying: `Adoration to the
Adityas and to the Visve Devas, who dwell in
heaven, who dwell in the world. Obtain that world for me,
the sacrificer!'
2-24:15. `That is the world for the sacrificer! I (the
sacrificer) shall go thither, when this life is over.
Take this! Cast back the bolt!' Having said this, he rises.
2-24:16. For him the Adityas and the Visve Devas fulfil
the third oblation. He who knows this, knows
the full measure of the sacrifice, yea, he knows it.

~ Chapter 3 ~
Third Prapathaka
Section 1
First Khanda
3-1:1. The sun is indeed the honey of the Devas. The
heaven is the cross-beam (from which) the sky
(hangs as) a hive, and the bright vapours are the eggs of
the bees.
3-1:2. The eastern rays of the sun are the honey-cells in
front. The Rik verses are the bees, the Rig-veda
(sacrifice) is the flower, the water (of the sacrificial
libations) is the nectar (of the flower).
3-1:3. Those very Rik verses then (as bees) brooded
over the Rig-veda sacrifice (the flower); and from it,
thus brooded on, sprang as its (nectar) essence, fame,
glory of countenance, vigour, strength, and health.
3-1:4. That (essence) flowed forth and went towards the
sun. And that forms what we call the red
(rohita) light of the rising sun.
Section 2
Second Khanda
3-2:1. The southern rays of the sun are the honey-cells
on the right. The Yagus verses are the bees, the
Yagur-veda sacrifice is the flower, the water (of the
sacrificial libations) is the nectar (of the flower).
3-2:2. Those very Yagus verses (as bees) brooded over
the Yagur-veda sacrifice (the flower); and from it,
thus brooded on, sprang as its (nectar) essence, fame,
glory of countenance, vigour, strength, and health. 
3-2:3. That flowed forth and went towards the sun. And
that forms what we call the white (sukla) light
of the sun.
Section 3
Third Khanda
3-3:1. The western rays of the sun are the honey-cells
behind. The Saman verses are the bees, the Samaveda sacrifice is the flower, the water is the nectar.
3-3:2. Those very Saman verses (as bees) brooded over
the Sama-veda sacrifice; and from it, thus brooded
on, sprang as its (nectar) essence, fame, glory of
countenance, vigour, strength, and health.
3-3:3. That flowed forth and went towards the sun. And
that forms what we call the dark (krishna) light
of the sun.
Section 4
Fourth Khanda
3-4:1. The northern rays of the sun are the honey-cells
on the left. The (hymns of the) Atharvangiras are
the bees, the Itihasa-purana (the reading of the old
stories) is the flower, the water is the nectar.
3-4:2. Those very hymns of the Atharvangiras (as bees)
brooded over the Itihasa-purana; and from it,
thus brooded on, sprang as its (nectar) essence, fame,
glory of countenance, vigour, strength, and health.
3-4:3. That flowed forth, and went towards the sun. And
that forms what we call the extreme dark (parah
krishnam) light of the sun.
Section 5
Fifth Khanda
3-5:1. The upward rays of the sun are the honey-cells
above. The secret doctrines are the bees, Brahman 
(the Om) is the flower, the water is the nectar.
3-5:2. Those secret doctrines (as bees) brooded over
Brahman (the Om); and from it, thus brooded on,
sprang as its (nectar) essence, fame, glory of
countenance, brightness, vigour, strength, and health.
3-5:3. That flowed forth, and went towards the sun. And
that forms what seems to stir in the centre of
the sun.
3-5:4. These (the different colours in the sun) are the
essences of the essences. For the Vedas are
essences (the best things in the world); and of them (after
they have assumed the form of sacrifice) these
(the colours rising to the sun) are again the essences.
They are the nectar of the nectar. For the Vedas are
nectar (immortal), and of them these are the nectar.
Section 6
Sixth Khanda
3-6:1. On the first of these nectars (the red light, which
represents fame, glory of countenance, vigour,
strength, health) the Vasus live, with Agni at their head.
True, the Devas do not eat or drink, but they
enjoy by seeing the nectar.
3-6:2. They enter into that (red) colour, and they rise from
that colour.
3-6:3. He who thus knows this nectar, becomes one of
the Vasus, with Agni at their head, he sees the
nectar and rejoices. And he, too, having entered that
colour, rises again from that colour.
3-6:4. So long as the sun rises in the east and sets in the
west, so long does he follow the sovereign
supremacy of the Vasus.
Section 7
Seventh Khanda
3-7:1. On the second of these nectars the Rudras live,
with Indra at their head. True, the Devas do not
eat or drink, but they enjoy by seeing the nectar.
3-7:2. They enter into that white colour, and they rise
from that colour.
3-7:3. He who thus knows this nectar, becomes one of
the Rudras, with Indra at their head, he sees the
nectar and rejoices. And he, having entered that colour,
rises again from that colour.
3-7:4. So long as the sun rises in the east and sets in the
west, twice as long does it rise in the south and
set in the north; and so long does he follow the sovereign
supremacy of the Rudras.
Section 8
Eighth Khanda
3-8:1. On the third of these nectars the Adityas live, with
Varuna at their head. True, the Devas do not
eat or drink, but they enjoy by seeing the nectar.
3-8:2. They enter into that (dark) colour, and they rise
from that colour.
3-8:3. He who thus knows this nectar, becomes one of
the Adityas, with Varuna at their head, he sees the
nectar and rejoices. And he, having entered that colour,
rises again from that colour.
3-8:4. So long as the sun rises in the south and sets in
the north, twice as long does it rise in the west and
set in the east; and so long does he follow the sovereign
supremacy of the Adityas.
Section 9
Ninth Khanda
3-9:1. On the fourth of these nectars the Maruts live, with
Soma at their head. True, the Devas do not eat
or drink, but they enjoy by seeing the nectar. 
3-9:2. They enter in that (very dark) colour, and they rise
from that colour.
3-9:3. He who thus knows this nectar, becomes one of
the Maruts, with Soma at their head, he sees the
nectar and rejoices. And he, having entered that colour,
rises again from that colour.
3-9:4. So long as the sun rises in the west and sets in the
east, twice as long does it rise in the north and
set in the south; and so long does he follow the sovereign
supremacy of the Maruts.
Section 10
Tenth Khanda
3-10:1. On the fifth of these nectars the Sadhyas live,
with Brahman at their head. True, the Devas do
not eat or drink, but they enjoy by seeing the nectar.
3-10:2. They enter into that colour, and they rise from
that colour.
3-10:3. He who thus knows this nectar, becomes one of
the Sadhyas, with Brahman at their head; he sees
the nectar and rejoices. And he, having entered that
colour, rises again from that colour.
3-10:4. So long as the sun rises in the north and sets in
the south, twice as long does it rise above, and set
below; and so long does he follow the sovereign power of
the Sadhyas.
Section 11
Eleventh Khanda
3-11:1. When from thence he has risen upwards, he
neither rises nor sets. He is alone, standing in the
centre. And on this there is this verse:
3-11:2. `Yonder he neither rises nor sets at any time. If
this is not true, ye gods, may I lose Brahman.'
3-11:3. And indeed to him who thus knows this Brahmaupanishad (the secret doctrine of the Veda) the
sun does not rise and does not set. For him there is day,
once and for all.
3-11:4. This doctrine (beginning with 3, 1, 1) Brahman
(m. Hiranyagarbha) told to Pragapati (Virag),
Pragapati to Manu, Manu to his offspring (Ikshvaku, &c.)
And the father told that (doctrine of) Brahman
(n.) to Uddalaka Aruni.
3-11:5. A father may therefore tell that doctrine of
Brahman to his eldest son, or to a worthy pupil.
But no one should tell it to anybody else, even if he gave
him the whole sea-girt earth, full of treasure, for
this doctrine is worth more than that, yea, it is worth more.
Section 12
Twelfth Khanda
3-12:1. The Gayatri (verse) is everything whatsoever
here exists. Gayatri indeed is speech, for speech
sings forth (gaya-ti) and protects (traya-te) everything that
here exists.
3-12:2. That Gayatri is also the earth, for everything that
here exists rests on the earth, and does not go
beyond.
3-12:3. That earth again is the body in man, for in it the
vital airs (pranas, which are everything) rest,
and do not go beyond.
3-12:4. That body again in man is the heart within man,
for in it the pranas (which are everything) rest,
and do not go beyond.
3-12:5. That Gayatri has four feet and is sixfold. And this
is also declared by a Rik verse (Rig-veda X,
90, 3):
3-12:6. `Such is the greatness of it (of Brahman, under
the disguise of Gayatri); greater than it is the 
Person (purusha). His feet are all things. The immortal
with three feet is in heaven (i.e. in himself).'
3-12:7. The Brahman which has been thus described (as
immortal with three feet in heaven, and as
Gayatri) is the same as the ether which is around us;
3-12:8. And the ether which is around us, is the same as
the ether which is within us. And the ether
which is within us,
3-12:9. That is the ether within the heart. That ether in
the heart (as Brahman) is omnipresent and
unchanging. He who knows this obtains omnipresent and
unchangeable happiness.
Section 13
Thirteenth Khanda
3-13:1. For that heart there are five gates belonging to
the Devas (the senses). The eastern gate is the
Prana (up-breathing), that is the eye, that is Aditya (the
sun). Let a man meditate on that as brightness
(glory of countenance) and health. He who knows this,
becomes bright and healthy.
3-13:2. The southern gate is the Vyana (back-breathing),
that is the ear, that is the moon. Let a man
meditate on that as happiness and fame. He who knows
this, becomes happy and famous.
3-13:3. The western gate is the Apana (down-breathing),
that is speech, that is Agni (fire). Let a man
meditate on that as glory of countenance and health. He
who knows this, becomes glorious and healthy.
3-13:4. The northern gate is the Samana (on-breathing),
that is mind, that is Parganya (rain). Let a man
meditate on that as celebrity and beauty. He who knows
this, becomes celebrated and beautiful.
3-13:5. The upper gate is the Udana (out-breathing), that
is air, that is ether. Let a man meditate on that
as strength and greatness. He who knows this, becomes
strong and great. 
3-13:6. These are the five men of Brahman, the doorkeepers of the Svarga (heaven) world. He who
knows these five men of Brahman, the door-keepers of
the Svarga world, in his family a strong son is
born. He who thus knows these five men of Brahman, as
the door-keepers of the Svarga world, enters
himself the Svarga world.
3-13:7. Now that light which shines above this heaven,
higher than all, higher than everything, in the
highest world, beyond which there are no other worlds,
that is the same light which is within man. And
of this we have this visible proof:
3-13:8. Namely, when we thus perceive by touch the
warmth here in the body. And of it we have this
audible proof: Namely, when we thus, after stopping our
ears, listen to what is like the rolling of a
carriage, or the bellowing of an ox, or the sound of a
burning fire (within the ears). Let a man meditate
on this as the (Brahman) which is seen and heard. He
who knows this, becomes conspicuous and
celebrated, yea, he becomes celebrated.
Section 14
Fourteenth Khanda
3-14:1. All this is Brahman (n.) Let a man meditate on
that (visible world) as beginning, ending, and
breathing in it (the Brahman).
Now man is a creature of will. According to what his will
is in this world, so will he be when he has
departed this life. Let him therefore have this will and
belief:
3-14:2. The intelligent, whose body is spirit, whose form
is light, whose thoughts are true, whose nature
is like ether (omnipresent and invisible), from whom all
works, all desires, all sweet odours and tastes
proceed; he who embraces all this, who never speaks,
and is never surprised,
3-14:3. He is my self within the heart, smaller than a corn
of rice, smaller than a corn of barley, smaller
than a mustard seed, smaller than a canary seed or the
kernel of a canary seed. He also is my self within
the heart, greater than the earth, greater than the sky,
greater than heaven, greater than all these worlds.
3-14:4. He from whom all works, all desires, all sweet
odours and tastes proceed, who embraces all this,
who never speaks and who is never surprised, he, my
self within the heart, is that Brahman (n.) When I
shall have departed from hence, I shall obtain him (that
Self). He who has this faith has no doubt; thus
said Sandilya, yea, thus he said.
Section 15
Fifteenth Khanda
3-15:1. The chest which has the sky for its circumference
and the earth for its bottom, does not decay, for
the quarters are its sides, and heaven its lid above. That
chest is a treasury, and all things are within it.
3-15:2. Its eastern quarter is called Guhu, its southern
Sahamana, its western Ragni, its northern
Subhuta. The child of those quarters is Vayu, the air, and
he who knows that the air is indeed the child of
the quarters, never weeps for his sons. `I know the wind
to be the child of the quarters, may I never weep
for my sons.'
3-15:3. `I turn to the imperishable chest with such and
such and such.'
`I turn to the Prana (life) with such and such and such.'
`I turn to Bhuh with such and such and such.'
`I turn to Bhuvah with such and such and such.'
`I turn to Svah with such and such and such.'
3-15:4. `When I said, I turn to Pran, then Pran means all
whatever exists here to that I turn.' 
3-15:5. `When I said, I turn to Bhuh, what I said is, I turn
to the earth, the sky, and heaven.'
3-15:6. `When I said, I turn to Bhuvah, what I said is, I
turn to Agni (fire), Vayu (air), Aditya (sun).'
3-15:7. `When I said, I turn to Svah, what I said is, I turn
to the Rig-veda, Yagur-veda, and Sama-veda.
That is what I said, yea, that is what I said.'
Section 16
Sixteenth Khanda
3-16:1. Man is sacrifice. His (first) twenty-four years are
the morning-libation. The Gayatri has twentyfour syllables, the morning-libation is offered with Gayatri
hymns. The Vasus are connected with that
part of the sacrifice. The Pranas (the five senses) are the
Vasus, for they make all this to abide
(vasayanti).
3-16:2. If anything ails him in that (early) age, let him say:
`Ye Pranas, ye Vasus, extend this my
morning-libation unto the midday-libation, that I, the
sacrificer, may not perish in the midst of the Pranas
or Vasus.' Thus he recovers from his illness, and
becomes whole.
3-16:3. The next forty-four years are the midday-libation.
The Trishtubh has forty-four syllables, the
midday-libation is offered with Trishtubh hymns. The
Rudras are connected with that part of it. The
Pranas are the Rudras, for they make all this to cry
(rodayanti).
3-16:4. If anything ails him in that (second) age, let him
say: `Ye Pranas, ye Rudras, extend this my
midday-libation unto the third libation, that I, the sacrificer,
may not perish in the midst of the Pranas or
Rudras.' Thus he recovers from his illness, and becomes
whole.
3-16:5. The next forty-eight years are the third libation.
The Gagati has forty-eight syllables, the third 
libation is offered with Gagati hymns. The Adityas are
connected with that part of it. The Pranas are the
Adityas, for they take up all this (adadate).
3-16:6. If anything ails him in that (third) age, let him say:
`Ye Pranas, ye Adityas, extend this my third
libation unto the full age, that I, the sacrificer, may not
perish in the midst of the Pranas or Adityas.' Thus
he recovers from his illness, and becomes whole.
3-16:7. Mahidasa Aitareya (the son of Itara), who knew
this, said (addressing a disease): `Why dost thou
afflict me, as I shall not die by it?' He lived a hundred and
sixteen years (i.e. 24 + 44 + 48). He, too, who
knows this lives on to a hundred and sixteen years.
Section 17
Seventeenth Khanda
3-17:1. When a man (who is the sacrificer) hungers,
thirsts, and abstains from pleasures, that is the
Diksha (initiatory rite).
3-17:2. When a man eats, drinks, and enjoys pleasures,
he does it with the Upasadas (the sacrificial days
on which the sacrificer is allowed to partake of food).
3-17:3. When a man laughs, eats, and delights himself,
he does it with the Stuta-sastras (hymns sung and
recited at the sacrifices).
3-17:4. Penance, liberality, righteousness, kindness,
truthfulness, these form his Dakshinas (gifts
bestowed on priests, &c.)
3-17:5. Therefore when they say, `There will be a birth,'
and `there has been a birth' (words used at the
Soma-sacrifice, and really meaning, `He will pour out the
Soma-juice,' and `he has poured out the Somajuice'), that is his new birth. His death is the Avabhritha
ceremony (when the sacrificial vessels are
carried away to be cleansed).
3-17:6. Ghora Angirasa, after having communicated this
(view of the sacrifice) to Krishna, the son of 
Devaki and he never thirsted again (after other
knowledge) said: `Let a man, when his end
approaches, take refuge with this Triad:
"Thou art the imperishable,"
"Thou art the unchangeable,"
"Thou art the edge of Prana."'
On this subject there are two Rik verses (Rig-veda VIII, 6,
30):
3-17:7. `Then they see (within themselves) the everpresent light of the old seed (of the world, the Sat),
the highest, which is lighted in the brilliant (Brahman).'
Rig-veda 1, 50, 10:
`Perceiving above the darkness (of ignorance) the
higher light (in the sun), as the higher light within the
heart, the bright source (of light and life) among the gods,
we have reached the highest light, yea, the
highest light.'
Section 18
Eighteenth Khanda
3-18:1. Let a man meditate on mind as Brahman (n.), this
is said with reference to the body. Let a man
meditate on the ether as Brahman (n.), this is said with
reference to the Devas. Thus both the meditation
which has reference to the body, and the meditation
which has reference to the Devas, has been taught.
3-18:2. That Brahman (mind) has four feet (quarters).
Speech is one foot, breath is one foot, the eye is
one foot, the ear is one foot so much with reference to
the body. Then with reference to the gods, Agni
(fire) is one foot, Vayu (air) is one foot, Aditya (sun) is one
foot, the quarters are one foot. Thus both the
worship which has reference to the body, and the worship
which has reference to the Devas, has been
taught.
3-18:3. Speech is indeed the fourth foot of Brahman.
That foot shines with Agni (fire) as its light, and
warms. He who knows this, shines and warms through
his celebrity, fame, and glory of countenance.
3-18:4. Breath is indeed the fourth foot of Brahman. That
foot shines with Vayu (air) as its light, and
warms. He who knows this, shines and warms through
his celebrity, fame, and glory of countenance.
3-18:5. The eye is indeed the fourth foot of Brahman.
That foot shines with Aditya (sun) as its light, and
warms. He who knows this, shines and warms through
his celebrity, fame, and glory of countenance.
3-18:6. The ear is indeed the fourth foot of Brahman.
That foot shines with the quarters as its light, and
warms. He who knows this, shines and warms through
his celebrity, fame, and glory of countenance.
Section 19
Nineteenth Khanda
3-19:1. Aditya (the sun) is Brahman, this is the doctrine,
and this is the fuller account of it:
In the beginning this was non-existent. It became
existent, it grew. It turned into an egg. The egg lay for
the time of a year. The egg broke open. The two halves
were one of silver, the other of gold.
3-19:2. The silver one became this earth, the golden one
the sky, the thick membrane (of the white) the
mountains, the thin membrane (of the yoke) the mist with
the clouds, the small veins the rivers, the fluid
the sea.
3-19:3. And what was born from it that was Aditya, the
sun. When he was born shouts of hurrah arose,
and all beings arose, and all things which they desired.
Therefore whenever the sun rises and sets, shouts
of hurrah arise, and all beings arise, and all things which
they desire.
3-19:4. If any one knowing this meditates on the sun as
Brahman, pleasant shouts will approach him and
will continue, yea, they will continue.

~ Chapter 4 ~
Fourth Prapathaka
Section 1
First Khanda
4-1:1. There lived once upon a time Ganasruti
Pautrayana (the great-grandson of Ganasruta), who was
a
pious giver, bestowing much wealth upon the people, and
always keeping open house. He built places of
refuge everywhere, wishing that people should
everywhere eat of his food.
4-1:2. Once in the night some Hamsas (flamingoes) flew
over his house, and one flamingo said to
another: `Hey, Bhallaksha, Bhallaksha (short-sighted
friend). The light (glory) of Ganasruti Pautrayana
has spread like the sky. Do not go near, that it may not
burn thee.'
4-1:3. The other answered him: `How can you speak of
him, being what he is (a raganya, noble), as if he
were like Raikva with the car?'
4-1:4. The first replied: `How is it with this Raikva with the
car of whom thou speakest?'
The other answered: `As (in a game of dice) all the lower
casts belong to him who has conquered with the
Krita cast, so whatever good deeds other people perform,
belong to that Raikva. He who knows what he
knows, he is thus spoken of by me.'
4-1:5. Ganasruti Pautrayana overheard this
conversation, and as soon as he had risen in the
morning, he 
said to his door-keeper (kshattri): `Friend, dost thou speak
of (me, as if I were) Raikva with the car?'
He replied: `How is it with this Raikva with the car?'
4-1:6. The king said: `As (in a game of dice), all the lower
casts belong to him who has conquered with
the Krita cast, so whatever good deeds other people
perform, belong to that Raikva. He who knows what
he knows, he is thus spoken of by me.'
4-1:7. The door-keeper went to look for Raikva, but
returned saying, `I found him not.' Then the king
said: `Alas! where a Brahmana should be searched for (in
the solitude of the forest), there go for him.'
4-1:8. The door-keeper came to a man who was lying
beneath a car and scratching his sores. He
addressed him, and said: `Sir, are you Raikva with the
car?'
He answered: `Here I am.'
Then the door-keeper returned, and said: `I have found
him.'
Section 2
Second Khanda
4-2:1. Then Ganasruti Pautrayana took six hundred
cows, a necklace, and a carriage with mules, went to
Raikva and said:
4-2:2. `Raikva, here are six hundred cows, a necklace,
and a carriage with mules; teach me the deity
which you worship.'
4-2:3. The other replied: `Fie, necklace and carriage be
thine, O Sudra, together with the cows.'
The Ganasruti Pautrayana took again a thousand cows, a
necklace, a carriage with mules, and his own
daughter, and went to him.
4-2:4. He said to him: `Raikva, there are a thousand
cows, a necklace, a carriage with mules, this wife,
and this village in which thou dwellest. Sir, teach me!'
4-2:5. He, opening her mouth, said: `You have brought
these (cows and other presents), O Sudra, but
only by that mouth did you make me speak.'
These are the Raikva-parna villages in the country of the
Mahavrishas (mahapunyas) where Raikva dwelt
under him. And he said to him:
Section 3
Third Khanda
4-3:1. `Air (vayu) is indeed the end of all. For when fire
goes out, it goes into air. When the sun goes
down, it goes into air. When the moon goes down, it
goes into air.
4-3:2. `When water dries up, it goes into air. Air indeed
consumes them all. So much with reference to
the Devas.
4-3:3. `Now with reference to the body. Breath (prana) is
indeed the end of all. When a man sleeps,
speech goes into breath, so do sight, hearing, and mind.
Breath indeed consumes them all.
4-3:4. `These are the two ends, air among the Devas,
breath among the senses (pranah).'
4-3:5. Once while Saunaka Kapeya and Abhipratarin
Kakshaseni were being waited on at their meal, a
religious student begged of them. They gave him
nothing.
4-3:6. He said: `One god who is he? swallowed the
four great ones, he, the guardian of the world.
O Kapeya, mortals see him not, O Abhipratarin, though
he dwells in many places. He to whom this food
belongs, to him it has not been given.' 
4-3:7. Saunaka Kapeya, pondering on that speech, went
to the student and said: `He is the self of the
Devas, the creator of all beings, with golden tusks, the
eater, not without intelligence. His greatness is
said to be great indeed, because, without being eaten, he
eats even what is not food. Thus do we, O
Brahmakarin, meditate on that Being.' Then he said:
`Give him food.'
4-3:8. They gave him food. Now these five (the eater
Vayu (air), and his food, Agni (fire), Aditya (sun),
Kandramas (moon), Ap (water)) and the other five (the
eater Prana (breath), and his food, speech, sight,
hearing, mind) make ten, and that is the Krita (the
highest) cast (representing the ten, the eaters and the
food). Therefore in all quarters those ten are food (and)
Krita (the highest cast). These are again the
Virag (of ten syllables) which eats the food. Through this
all this becomes seen. He who knows this sees
all this and becomes an eater of food, yea, he becomes
an eater of food.
Section 4
Fourth Khanda
4-4:1. Satyakama, the son of Gabala, addressed his
mother and said: `I wish to become a Brahmakarin
(religious student), mother. Of what family am I?'
4-4:2. She said to him: `I do not know, my child, of what
family thou art. In my youth when I had to
move about much as a servant (waiting on the guests in
my father's house), I conceived thee. I do not
know of what family thou art. I am Gabala by name, thou
art Satyakama (Philalethes). Say that thou art
Satyakama Gabala.'
4-4:3. He going to Gautama Haridrumata said to him, `I
wish to become a Brahmakarin with you, Sir.
May I come to you, Sir?'
4-4:4. He {Gautama} said to him: `Of what family are you,
my friend?' He {Satyakama} replied: `I do
not know, Sir, of what family I am. I asked my mother,
and she answered: "In my youth when I had to 
move about much as a servant, I conceived thee. I do
not know of what family thou art. I am Gabala by
name, thou art Satyakama," I am therefore Satyakama
Gabala, Sir.'
4-4:5. He said to him: `No one but a true Brahmana
would thus speak out. Go and fetch fuel, friend, I
shall initiate you. You have not swerved from the truth.'
Having initiated him, he chose four hundred lean and
weak cows, and said: `Tend these, friend.' He drove
them out and said to himself, `I shall not return unless I
bring back a thousand.' He dwelt a number of
years (in the forest), and when the cows had become a
thousand,
Section 5
Fifth Khanda
4-5:1. The bull of the herd (meant for Vayu) said to him:
`Satyakama!' He replied: `Sir!' The bull said:
`We have become a thousand, lead us to the house of
the teacher;
4-5:2. `And I will declare to you one foot of Brahman.'
`Declare it, Sir,' he replied.
He said to him: `The eastern region is one quarter, the
western region is one quarter, the southern region
is one quarter, the northern region is one quarter. This is
a foot of Brahman, consisting of the four
quarters, and called Prakasavat (endowed with
splendour).
4-5:3. `He who knows this and meditates on the foot of
Brahman, consisting of four quarters, by the name
of Prakasavat, becomes endowed with splendour in this
world. He conquers the resplendent worlds,
whoever knows this and meditates on the foot of
Brahman, consisting of the four quarters, by the name of
Prakasavat.
Section 6 
Sixth Khanda
4-6:1. `Agni will declare to you another foot of Brahman.'
(After these words of the bull), Satyakama, on the
morrow, drove the cows (toward the house of the
teacher). And when they came towards the evening, he
lighted a fire, penned the cows, laid wood on the
fire, and sat down behind the fire, looking to the east.
4-6:2. Then Agni (the fire) said to him: `Satyakama!' He
replied: `Sir.'
4-6:3. Agni said: `Friend, I will declare unto you one foot
of Brahman.'
`Declare it, Sir,' he replied.
He said to him: `The earth is one quarter, the sky is one
quarter, the heaven is one quarter, the ocean is
one quarter. This is a foot of Brahman, consisting of four
quarters, and called Anantavat (endless).
4-6:4. `He who knows this and meditates on the foot of
Brahman, consisting of four quarters, by the name
of Anantavat, becomes endless in this world. He
conquers the endless worlds, whoever knows this and
meditates on the foot of Brahman, consisting of four
quarters, by the name of Anantavat.
Section 7
Seventh Khanda
4-7:1. `A Hamsa (flamingo, meant for the sun) will
declare to you another foot of Brahman.'
(After these words of Agni), Satyakama, on the morrow,
drove the cows onward. And when they came
towards the evening, he lighted a fire, penned the cows,
laid wood on the fire, and sat down behind the
fire, looking toward the east.
4-7:2. Then a Hamsa flew near and said to him:
`Satyakama.' He replied: `Sir.' 
4-7:3. The Hamsa said: `Friend, I will declare unto you
one foot of Brahman.'
`Declare it, Sir,' he replied.
He said to him: `Fire is one quarter, the sun is one
quarter, the moon is one quarter, lightning is one
quarter. This is a foot of Brahman, consisting of four
quarters, and called Gyotishmat (full of light).
4-7:4. `He who knows this and meditates on the foot of
Brahman, consisting of four quarters, by the name
of Gyotishmat, becomes full of light in this world. He
conquers the worlds which are full of light,
whoever knows this and meditates on the foot of
Brahman, consisting of four quarters, by the name of
Gyotishmat.
Section 8
Eighth Khanda
4-8:1. `A diver-bird (Madgu, meant for Pran) will declare
to you another foot of Brahman.'
(After these words of the Hamsa), Satyakama, on the
morrow, drove the cows onward. And when they
came towards the evening, he lighted a fire, penned the
cows, laid wood on the fire, and sat down behind
the fire, looking toward the east.
4-8:2. Then a diver flew near and said to him:
`Satyakama.' He replied: `Sir.'
4-8:3. The diver said: `Friend, I will declare unto you one
foot of Brahman.'
`Declare it, Sir,' he replied.
He said to him: `Breath is one quarter, the eye is one
quarter, the ear is one quarter, the mind is one
quarter. This is a foot of Brahman, consisting of four
quarters, and called Ayatanavat (having a home).
`He who knows this and meditates on the foot of
Brahman, consisting of four quarters, by the name of 
Ayatanavat, becomes possessed of a home in this world.
He conquers the worlds which offer a home,
whoever knows this and meditates on the foot of
Brahman, consisting of four quarters, by the name of
Ayatanavat.'
Section 9
Ninth Khanda
4-9:1. Thus he reached the house of his teacher. The
teacher said to him: `Satyakama.' He replied: `Sir.'
4-9:2. The teacher said: `Friend, you shine like one who
knows Brahman. Who then has taught you?' He
replied: `Not men. But you only, Sir, I wish, should teach
me;
4-9:3. `For I have heard from men like you, Sir, that only
knowledge which is learnt from a teacher
(Akarya), leads to real good.' Then he taught him the
same knowledge. Nothing was left out, yea,
nothing was left out.
Section 10
Tenth Khanda
4-10:1. Upakosala Kamalayana dwelt as a Brahmakarin
(religious student) in the house of Satyakama
Gabala. He tended his fires for twelve years. But the
teacher, though he allowed other pupils (after they
had learnt the sacred books) to depart to their own
homes, did not allow Upakosala to depart.
4-10:2. Then his wife said to him: `This student, who is
quite exhausted (with austerities), has carefully
tended your fires. Let not the fires themselves blame
you, but teach him.' The teacher, however, went
away on a journey without having taught him.
4-10:3. The student from sorrow was not able to eat.
Then the wife of the teacher said to him: `Student,
eat! Why do you not eat?' He said: `There are many
desires in this man here, which lose themselves in 
different directions. I am full of sorrows, and shall take no
food.'
4-10:4. Thereupon the fires said among themselves:
`This student, who is quite exhausted, has carefully
tended us. Well, let us teach him.' They said to him:
4-10:5. `Breath is Brahman, Ka (pleasure) is Brahman,
Kha (ether) is Brahman.'
He said: `I understand that breath is Brahman, but I do
not understand Ka or Kha.'
They said: `What is Ka is Kha, what is Kha is Ka.' They
therefore taught him Brahman as breath, and as
the ether (in the heart).
Section 11
Eleventh Khanda
4-11:1. After that the Garhapatya fire taught him: `Earth,
fire, food, and the sun (these are my forms, or
forms of Brahman). The person that is seen in the sun, I
am he, I am he indeed.
4-11:2. `He who knowing this meditates on him, destroys
sin, obtains the world (of Agni Garhapatya),
reaches his full age, and lives long; his descendants do
not perish. We guard him in this world and in the
other, whosoever knowing this meditates on him.'
Section 12
Twelfth Khanda
4-12:1. Then the Anvaharya fire taught him: `Water, the
quarters, the stars, the moon (these are my
forms). The person that is seen in the moon, I am he, I
am he indeed.
4-12:2. `He who knowing this meditates on him, destroys
sin, obtains the world (of Agni Anvaharya),
reaches his full age, and lives long; his descendants do
not perish. We guard him in this world and in the
other, whosoever knowing this meditates on him.' 
Section 13
Thirteenth Khanda
4-13:1. Then the Ahavaniya fire taught him: `Breath,
ether, heaven, and lightning (these are my forms).
The person that is seen in the lightning, I am he, I am he
indeed.
4-13:2. `He who knowing this meditates on him, destroys
sin, obtains the world (of Agni Ahavaniya),
reaches his full age, and lives long; his descendants do
not perish. We guard him in this world and in the
other, whosoever knowing this meditates on him.'
Section 14
Fourteenth Khanda
4-14:1. Then they all said: `Upakosala, this is our
knowledge, our friend, and the knowledge of the Self,
but the teacher will tell you the way (to another life).'
4-14:2. In time his teacher came back, and said to him:
`Upakosala.' He answered: `Sir.' The teacher
said: `Friend, your face shines like that of one who knows
Brahman. Who has taught you?'
`Who should teach me, Sir?' he said. He denies, as it
were. And he said (pointing) to the fires: `Are these
fires other than fires?'
The teacher said: `What, my friend, have these fires told
you?'
4-14:3. He answered: `This' (repeating some of what
they had told him).
The teacher said: `My friend, they have taught you about
the worlds, but I shall tell you this; and as water
does not cling to a lotus leaf, so no evil deed clings to one
who knows it.' He said: `Sir, tell it {to} me.'
Section 15 
Fifteenth Khanda
4-15:1. He said: `The person that is seen in the eye, that
is the Self. This is the immortal, the fearless,
this is Brahman. Even though they drop melted butter or
water on him, it runs away on both sides.
4-15:2. `They call him Samyadvama, for all blessings
(vama) go towards him (samyanti). All blessings
go towards him who knows this.
4-15:3. `He is also Vamani, for he leads (nayati) all
blessings (vama). He leads all blessings who knows
this.
4-15:4. `He is also Bhamani, for he shines (bhati) in all
worlds. He who knows this, shines in all worlds.
4-15:5. `Now (if one who knows this, dies), whether
people perform obsequies for him or no, he goes to
light (arkis), from light to day, from day to the light half of
the moon, from the light half of the moon to
the six months during which the sun goes to the north,
from the months to the year, from the year to the
sun, from the sun to the moon, from the moon to the
lightning. There is a person not human,
4-15:6. `He leads them to Brahman. This is the path of
the Devas, the path that leads to Brahman.
Those who proceed on that path, do not return to the life
of man, yea, they do not return.'
Section 16
Sixteenth Khanda
4-16:1. Verily, he who purifies (Vayu) is the sacrifice, for
he (the air) moving along, purifies everything.
Because moving along he purifies everything, therefore
he is the sacrifice. Of that sacrifice there are two
ways, by mind and by speech.
4-16:2. The Brahman priest performs one of them in his
mind, the Hotri, Adhvaryu, and Udgatri priests
perform the other by words. When the Brahman priest,
after the Prataranuvaka ceremony has begun, but 
before the recitation of the Paridhaniya hymn, has (to
break his silence and) to speak,
4-16:3. He performs perfectly the one way only (that by
words), but the other is injured. As a man
walking on one foot, or a carriage going on one wheel, is
injured, his sacrifice is injured, and with the
injured sacrifice the sacrificer is injured; yes, having
sacrificed, he becomes worse.
4-16:4. But when after the Prataranuvaka ceremony has
begun, and before the recitation of the
Paridhaniya hymn, the Brahman priest has not (to break
his silence and) to speak, they perform both ways
perfectly, and neither of them is injured.
4-16:5. As a man walking on two legs and a carriage
going on two wheels gets on, so his sacrifice gets
on, and with the successful sacrifice the sacrificer gets
on; yes, having sacrificed, he becomes better.
Section 17
Seventeenth Khanda
4-17:1. Pragapati brooded over the worlds, and from
them thus brooded on he squeezed out the essences,
Agni (fire) from the earth, Vayu (air) from the sky, Aditya
(the sun) from heaven.
4-17:2. He brooded over these three deities, and from
them thus brooded on he squeezed out the essences,
the Rik verses from Agni, the Yagus verses from Vayu,
the Saman verses from Aditya.
4-17:3. He brooded over the threefold knowledge (the
three Vedas), and from it thus brooded on he
squeezed out the essences, the sacred interjection Bhus
from the Rik verses, the sacred interjection Bhuvas
from the Yagus verses, the sacred interjection Svar from
the Saman verses.
4-17:4. If the sacrifice is injured from the Rig-veda side,
let him offer a libation in the Garhapatya fire,
saying, Bhuh, Svaha! Thus does he bind together and
heal, by means of the essence and the power of the 
Rik verses themselves, whatever break the Rik sacrifice
may have suffered.
4-17:5. If the sacrifice is injured from the Yagur-veda
side, let him offer a libation in the Dakshina fire,
saying, Bhuvah, Svaha! Thus does he bind together and
heal, by means of the essence and the power of
the Yagus verses themselves, whatever break the Yagus
sacrifice may have suffered.
4-17:6. If the sacrifice is injured by the Sama-veda side,
let him offer a libation in the Ahavaniya fire,
saying, Svah, Svaha! Thus does he bind together and
heal, by means of the essence and the power of the
Saman verses themselves, whatever break the Saman
sacrifice may have suffered.
4-17:7. As one binds (softens) gold by means of lavana
(borax), and silver by means of gold, and tin by
means of silver, and lead by means of tin, and iron (loha)
by means of lead, and wood by means of iron, or
also by means of leather,
4-17:8. Thus does one bind together and heal any break
in the sacrifice by means of (the Vyahritis or
sacrificial interjections which are) the essence and
strength of the three worlds, of the deities, and of the
threefold knowledge. That sacrifice is healed in which
there is a Brahman priest who knows this.
4-17:9. That sacrifice is inclined towards the north (in the
right way) in which there is a Brahman priest
who knows this. And with regard to such a Brahman
priest there is the following Gatha: `Wherever it
falls back, thither the man goes,' viz. the Brahman only,
as one of the Ritvig priests. `He saves the
Kurus as a mare' (viz. a Brahman priest who knows this,
saves the sacrifice, the sacrificer, and all the
other priests). Therefore let a man make him who knows
this his Brahman priest, not one who does not
know it, who does not know it.

Fifth Prapathaka
Section 1
First Khanda
5-1:1. He who knows the oldest and the best becomes
himself the oldest and the best. Breath indeed is
the oldest and the best.
5-1:2. He who knows the richest, becomes himself the
richest. Speech indeed is the richest.
5-1:3. He who knows the firm rest, becomes himself firm
in this world and in the next. The eye indeed is
the firm rest.
5-1:4. He who knows success, his wishes succeed, both
his divine and human wishes. The ear indeed is
success.
5-1:5. He who knows the home, becomes a home of his
people. The mind indeed is the home.
5-1:6. The five senses quarrelled together, who was the
best, saying, I am better, I am better.
5-1:7. They went to their father Pragapati and said: `Sir,
who is the best of us?' He replied: `He by whose
departure the body seems worse than worst, he is the
best of you.'
5-1:8. The tongue (speech) departed, and having been
absent for a year, it came round and said: `How
have you been able to live without me?' They replied:
`Like mute people, not speaking, but breathing with
the breath, seeing with the eye, hearing with the ear,
thinking with the mind. Thus we lived.' Then
speech went back.
5-1:9. The eye (sight) departed, and having been absent
for a year, it came round and said: `How have
you been able to live without me?' They replied: `Like
blind people, not seeing, but breathing with the
breath, speaking with the tongue, hearing with the ear,
thinking with the mind. Thus we lived.' Then the 
eye went back.
5-1:10. The ear (hearing) departed, and having been
absent for a year, it came round and said: `How have
you been able to live without me?' They replied: `Like
deaf people, not hearing, but breathing with the
breath, speaking with the tongue, thinking with the mind.
Thus we lived.' Then the ear went back.
5-1:11. The mind departed, and having been absent for a
year, it came round and said: `How have you
been able to live without me?' They replied: `Like
children whose mind is not yet formed, but breathing
with the breath, speaking with the tongue, seeing with the
eye, hearing with the ear. Thus we lived.'
Then the mind went back.
5-1:12. The breath, when on the point of departing, tore
up the other senses, as a horse, going to start,
might tear up the pegs to which he is tethered. They
came to him and said: `Sir, be thou (our lord); thou
art the best among us. Do not depart from us!'
5-1:13. Then the tongue said to him: `If I am the richest,
thou art the richest.' The eye said to him: `If I
am the firm rest, thou art the firm rest.'
5-1:14. The ear said to him: `If I am success, thou art
success.' The mind said to him: `If I am the home,
thou art the home.'
5-1:15. And people do not call them, the tongues, the
eyes, the ears, the minds, but the breaths (prana,
the senses). For breath are all these.
Section 2
Second Khanda
5-2:1. Breath said: `What shall be my food?' They
answered: `Whatever there is, even unto dogs and
birds.' Therefore this is food for Ana (the breather). His
name is clearly Ana. To him who knows this
there is nothing that is not (proper) food.
5-2:2. He said: `What shall be my dress?' They
answered: `Water.' Therefore wise people, when they are
going to eat food, surround their food before and after
with water.' He (prana) thus gains a dress, and is
no longer naked.
5-2:3. Satyakama Gabala, after he had communicated
this to Gosruti Vaiyaghrapadya, said to him: `If
you were to tell this to a dry stick, branches would grow,
and leaves spring from
it.'
5-2:4. If a man wishes to reach greatness, let him
perform the Diksha (preparatory rite) on the day of the
new moon, and then, on the night of the full moon, let him
stir a mash of all kinds of herbs with curds and
honey, and let him pour ghee on the fire (avasathya
laukika), saying, `Svaha to the oldest and the best.'
After that let him throw all that remains (of the ghee) into
the mash.
5-2:5. In the same manner let him pour ghee on the fire,
saying, `Svaha to the richest.' After that let him
throw all that remains together into the mash.
In the same manner let him pour ghee on the fire, saying,
`Svaha to the firm rest.' After that let him
throw all that remains together into the mash.
In the same manner let him pour ghee on the fire, saying,
`Svaha to success.' After that let him throw all
that remains together into the mash.
5-2:6. Then going forward and placing the mash in his
hands, he recites: `Thou (Pran) art Ama by name,
for all this together exists in thee. He is the oldest and
best, the king, the sovereign. May he make me the
oldest, the best, the king, the sovereign. May I be all this.'
5-2:7. Then he eats with the following Rik verse at every
foot: `We choose that food' here he swallows
`Of the divine Savitri (prana)' here he swallows `The
best and all-supporting food' here he
swallows `We meditate on the speed of Bhaga (Savitri,
prana)' here he drinks all. 
5-2:8. Having cleansed the vessel, whether it be a kamsa
or a kamasa, he sits down behind the fire on a
skin or on the bare ground, without speaking or making
any other effort. If in his dream he sees a
woman, let him know this to be a sign that his sacrifice
has succeeded.
5-2:9. On this there is a Sloka: `If during sacrifices which
are to fulfil certain wishes he sees in his
dreams a woman, let him know success from this vision in
a dream, yea, from this vision in a dream.'
Section 3
Third Khanda
5-3:1. Svetaketu Aruneya went to an assembly of the
Pankalas. Pravahana Gaivali said to him: `Boy, has
your father instructed you?' `Yes, Sir,' he replied.
5-3:2. `Do you know to what place men go from here?'
`No, Sir,' he replied.
`Do you know how they return again?' `No Sir,' he
replied.
`Do you know where the path of Devas and the path of
the fathers diverge?' `No, Sir,' he replied.
5-3:3. `Do you know why that world never becomes full?'
`No, Sir,' he replied.
`Do you know why in the fifth libation water is called
Man?' `No, Sir,' he replied.
5-3:4. `Then why did you say (you had been) instructed?
How could anybody who did not know these
things say that he had been instructed?' Then the boy
went back sorrowful to the place of his father, and
said: `Though you had not instructed me, Sir, you said
you had instructed me.
5-3:5. `That fellow of a Raganya asked me five
questions, and I could not answer one of them.' The
father said: `As you have told me these questions of his, I
do not know any one of them. If I knew these 
questions, how should I not have told you?'
5-3:6. Then Gautama went to the king's place, and when
he had come to him, the king offered him
proper respect. In the morning the king went out on his
way to the assembly. The king said to him: `Sir,
Gautama, ask a boon of such things as men possess.'
He replied: `Such things as men possess may remain
with you. Tell me the speech which you addressed to the
boy.'
5-3:7. The king was perplexed, and commanded him,
saying: `Stay with me some time.' Then he said:
`As (to what) you have said to me, Gautama, this
knowledge did not go to any Brahmana before you, and
therefore this teaching belonged in all the worlds to the
Kshatra class alone. Then he began:
Section 4
Fourth Khanda
5-4:1. `The altar (on which the sacrifice is supposed to
be offered) is that world (heaven), O Gautama; its
fuel is the sun itself, the smoke his rays, the light the day,
the coals the moon, the sparks the stars.
5-4:2. `On that altar the Devas (or pranas, represented
by Agni, &c.) offer the sraddha libation
(consisting of water). From that oblation rises Soma, the
king (the moon).
Section 5
Fifth Khanda
5-5:1. `The altar is Parganya (the god of rain), O
Gautama; its fuel is the air itself, the smoke the cloud,
the light the lightning, the coals the thunderbolt, the
sparks the thunderings.
5-5:2. `On that altar the Devas offer Soma, the king (the
moon). From that oblation rises rain.
Section 6 
Sixth Khanda
5-6:1. `The altar is the earth, O Gautama; its fuel is the
year itself, the smoke the ether, the light the
night, the coals the quarters, the sparks the intermediate
quarters.
5-6:2. `On that altar the Devas (pranas) offer rain. From
that oblation rises food (corn, &c.)
Section 7
Seventh Khanda
5-7:1. `The altar is man, O Gautama; its fuel speech
itself, the smoke the breath, the light the tongue, the
coals the eye, the sparks the ear.
5-7:2. `On that altar the Devas (pranas) offer food. From
that oblation rises seed.
Section 8
Eighth Khanda
5-8:1. `The altar is woman, O Gautama.
5-8:2. `On that altar the Devas (pranas) offer seed. From
that oblation rises the germ.
Section 9
Ninth Khanda
5-9:1. `For this reason is water in the fifth oblation called
Man. This germ, covered in the womb, having
dwelt there ten months, or more or less, is born.
5-9:2. `When born, he lives whatever the length of his life
may be. When he has departed, his friends
carry him, as appointed, to the fire (of the funeral pile)
from whence he came, from whence he sprang.
Section 10
Tenth Khanda 
5-10:1. `Those who know this (even though they still be
grihasthas, householders) and those who in the
forest follow faith and austerities (the vanaprasthas, and
of the parivragakas those who do not yet know
the Highest Brahman) go to light (arkis), from light to day,
from day to the light half of the moon, from
the light half of the moon to the six months when the sun
goes to the north, from the six months when the
sun goes to the north to the year, from the year to the
sun, from the sun to the moon, from the moon to the
lightning. There is a person not human,
5-10:2. `He leads them to Brahman (the conditioned
Brahman). This is the path of the Devas.
5-10:3. `But they who living in a village practise (a life of)
sacrifices, works of public utility, and alms,
they go to the smoke, from smoke to night, from night to
the dark half of the moon, from the dark half of
the moon to the six months when the sun goes to the
south. But they do not reach the year.
5-10:4. `From the months they go to the world of the
fathers, from the world of the fathers to the ether,
from the ether to the moon. That is Soma, the king. Here
they are loved (eaten) by the Devas, yes, the
Devas love (eat) them.
5-10:5. `Having dwelt there, till their (good) works are
consumed, they return again that way as they
came, to the ether, from the ether to the air. Then the
sacrificer, having become air, becomes smoke,
having become smoke, he becomes mist,
5-10:6. `Having become mist, he becomes a cloud,
having become a cloud, he rains down. Then he is
born as rice and corn, herbs and trees, sesamum, and
beans. From thence the escape is beset with most
difficulties. For whoever the persons may be that eat the
food, and beget offspring, he henceforth becomes
like unto them.
5-10:7. `Those whose conduct has been good, will
quickly attain some good birth, the birth of a 
Brahmana, or a Kshatriya, or a Vaisya. But those whose
conduct has been evil, will quickly attain an evil
birth, the birth of a dog, or a hog, or a Kandala.
5-10:8. `On neither of these two ways those small
creatures (flies, worms, &c.) are continually returning
of whom it may be said, Live and die. Theirs is a third
place.
`Therefore that world never becomes full (compare with
{Kh}. 5, 3, 2).
`Hence let a man take care to himself! And thus it is said
in the following Sloka:
5-10:9. `A man who steals gold, who drinks spirits, who
dishonours his Guru's bed, who kills a Brahman,
these four fall, and as a fifth he who associates with them.
5-10:10. `But he who thus knows the five fires is not
defiled by sin even though he associates with them.
He who knows this, is pure, clean, and obtains the world
of the blessed, yea, he obtains the world of the
blessed.'
Section 11
Eleventh Khanda
5-11:1. Prakinasala Aupamanyava, Satyayagna
Paulushi, Indradyumna Bhallaveya, Gana Sarkarakshya,
and Budila Asvatarasvi, these five great householders
and great theologians came once together and held
a discussion as to What is our Self, and what is Brahman.
5-11:2. They reflected and said: `Sirs, there is that
Uddalaka Aruni, who knows at present that Self,
called Vaisvanara. Well, let us go to him.' They went to
him.
5-11:3. But he reflected: `Those great householders and
great theologians will examine me, and I shall
not be able to tell them all; therefore I shall recommend
another teacher to them.'
5-11:4. He said to them: `Sirs, Asvapati Kaikeya knows
at present that Self, called Vaisvanara. Well, let
us go to him.' They went to him.
5-11:5. When they arrived (the king) ordered proper
presents to be made separately to each of them. And
rising the next morning he said: `In my kingdom there is
no thief, no miser, no drunkard, no man without
an altar in his house, no ignorant person, no adulterer,
much less an adulteress. I am going to perform a
sacrifice, Sirs, and as much wealth as I give to each
Ritvig priest, I shall give to you, Sirs. Please to stay
here.'
5-11:6. They replied: `Every man ought to say for what
purpose he comes. You know at present that
Vaisvanara Self, tell us that.'
5-11:7. He said: `To-morrow I shall give you an answer.'
Therefore on the next morning they approached
him, carrying fuel in their hands (like students), and he,
without first demanding any preparatory rites,
said to them:
Section 12
Twelfth Khanda
5-12:1. `Aupamanyava, whom do you meditate on as the
Self?' He replied: `Heaven only, venerable
king.' He said: `The Self which you meditate on is the
Vaisvanara Self, called Sutegas (having good light).
Therefore every kind of Soma libation is seen in your
house.
5-12:2. `You eat food, and see your desire (a son, &c.),
and whoever thus meditates on that Vaisvanara
Self, eats food, sees his desire, and has Vedic glory
(arising from study and sacrifice) in his house. That,
however, is but the head of the Self, and thus your head
would have fallen (in a discussion), if you had not
come to me.'
Section 13
Thirteenth Khanda 
5-13:1. Then he said to Satyayagna Paulushi: `O
Prakinayogya, whom do you meditate on as the Self?'
He replied: `The sun only, venerable king.' He said: `The
Self which you meditate on is the Vaisvanara
Self, called Visvarupa (multiform). Therefore much and
manifold wealth is seen in your house.
5-13:2. `There is a car with mules, full of slaves and
jewels. You eat food and see your desire, and
whoever thus meditates on that Vaisvanara Self, eats
food and sees his desire, and has Vedic glory in his
house.
`That, however, is but the eye of the Self, and you would
have become blind, if you had not come to me.'
Section 14
Fourteenth Khanda
5-14:1. Then he said to Indradyumna Bhallaveya: `O
Vaiyaghrapadya, whom do you meditate on as the
Self?' He replied: `Air only, venerable king.' He said:
`The Self which you meditate on is the Vaisvanara
Self, called Prithagvartman (having various courses).
Therefore offerings come to you in various ways,
and rows of cars follow you in various ways.
5-14:2. `You eat food and see your desire, and whoever
thus meditates on that Vaisvanara Self, eats food
and sees his desire, and has Vedic glory in his house.
`That, however, is but the breath of the Self, and your
breath would have left you, if you had not come to
me.'
Section 15
Fifteenth Khanda
5-15:1. Then he said to Gana Sarkarakshya: `Whom do
you meditate on as the Self?' He replied: `Ether
only, venerable king.' He said: `The Self which you
meditate on is the Vaisvanara Self, called Bahula
(full). Therefore you are full of offspring and wealth. 
5-15:2. `You eat food and see your desire, and whoever
thus meditates on that Vaisvanara Self, eats food
and sees his desire, and has Vedic glory in his house.
`That, however, is but the trunk of the Self, and your trunk
would have perished, if you had not come to
me.'
Section 16
Sixteenth Khanda
5-16:1. Then he said to Budila Asvatarasvi, `O
Vaiyaghrapadya, whom do you meditate on as the Self?'
He replied: `Water only, venerable king.' He said; `The
Self which you meditate on is the Vaisvanara
Self, called Rayi (wealth). Therefore are you wealthy and
flourishing.
5-16:2. `You eat food and see your desire, and whoever
thus meditates on that Vaisvanara Self, eats food
and sees his desire, and has Vedic glory in his house.
`That, however, is but the bladder of the Self, and your
bladder would have burst, if you had not come to
me.'
Section 17
Seventeenth Khanda
5-17:1. Then he said to Auddalaka Aruni: `O Gautama,
whom do you meditate on as the Self?' He
replied: `The earth only, venerable king.' He said: `The
Self which you meditate on is the Vaisvanara
Self, called Pratishtha (firm rest). Therefore you stand
firm with offspring and cattle.
5-17:2. `You eat food and see your desire, and whoever
thus meditates on that Vaisvanara Self, eats food
and sees his desire, and has Vedic glory in his house.
`That, however, are but the feet of the Self, and your feet
would have given way, if you had not come to
me.' 
Section 18
Eighteenth Khanda
5-18:1. Then he said to them all: `You eat your food,
knowing that Vaisvanara Self as if it were many.
But he who worships the Vaisvanara Self as a span long,
and as identical with himself, he eats food in all
worlds, in all beings, in all Selfs.
5-18:2. `Of that Vaisvanara Self the head is Sutegas
(having good light), the eye Visvarupa (multiform),
the breath Prithagvartman (having various courses), the
trunk Bahula (full), the bladder Rayi (wealth), the
feet the earth, the chest the altar, the hairs the grass on
the altar, the heart the Garhapatya fire, the mind
the Anvaharya fire, the mouth the Ahavaniya fire.
Section 19
Nineteenth Khanda
5-19:1. `Therefore the first food which a man may take, is
in the place of Homa. And he who offers that
first oblation, should offer it to Prana (up-breathing),
saying Svaha. Then Prana (up-breathing) is
satisfied,
5-19:2. `If Prana is satisfied, the eye is satisfied, if the
eye is satisfied, the sun is satisfied, if the sun is
satisfied, heaven is satisfied, if heaven is satisfied,
whatever is under heaven and under the sun is
satisfied. And through their satisfaction he (the sacrificer
or eater) himself is satisfied with offspring,
cattle, health, brightness, and Vedic splendour.
Section 20
Twentieth Khanda
5-20:1. `And he who offers the second oblation, should
offer it to Vyana (back-breathing), saying Svaha.
Then Vyana is satisfied,
5-20:2. `If Vyana is satisfied, the ear is satisfied, if the
ear is satisfied, the moon is satisfied, if the moon
is satisfied, the quarters are satisfied, if the quarters are
satisfied, whatever is under the quarters and under
the moon is satisfied. And through their satisfaction he
(the sacrificer or eater) himself is satisfied with
offspring, cattle, health, brightness, and Vedic splendour.
Section 21
Twenty-First Khanda
5-21:1. `And he who offers the third oblation, should offer
it to Apana (down-breathing), saying Svaha.
Then Apana is satisfied. If Apana is satisfied, the tongue
is satisfied, if the tongue is satisfied, Agni (fire)
is satisfied, if Agni is satisfied, the earth is satisfied, if the
earth is satisfied, whatever is under the earth
and under fire is satisfied.
5-21:2. `And through their satisfaction he (the sacrificer
or eater) himself is satisfied with offspring,
cattle, health, brightness, and Vedic splendour.
Section 22
Twenty-First Khanda
5-22:1. `And he who offers the fourth oblation, should
offer it to Samana (on-breathing), saying Svaha.
Then Samana is satisfied,
5-22:2. `If Samana is satisfied, the mind is satisfied, if the
mind is satisfied, Parganya (god of rain) is
satisfied, if Parganya is satisfied, lightning is satisfied, if
lightning is satisfied, whatever is under
Parganya and under lightning is satisfied. And through
their satisfaction he (the sacrificer or eater)
himself is satisfied with offspring, cattle, health,
brightness, and Vedic splendour.
Section 23
Twenty-Third Khanda
5-23:1. `And he who offers the fifth oblation, should offer
it to Udana (out-breathing), saying Svaha.
Then Udana is satisfied,
5-23:2. `If Udana is satisfied, Vayu (air) is satisfied, if
Vayu is satisfied, ether is satisfied, if ether is
satisfied, whatever is under Vayu and under the ether is
satisfied. And through their satisfaction he (the
sacrificer or eater) himself is satisfied with offspring,
cattle, health, brightness, and Vedic splendour.
Section 24
Twenty-Fourth Khanda
5-24:1. `If, without knowing this, one offers an Agnihotra,
it would be as if a man were to remove the live
coals and pour his libation on dead ashes.
5-24:2. `But he who offers this Agnihotra with a full
knowledge of its true purport, he offers it (i.e. he
eats food) in all worlds, in all beings, in all Selfs.
5-24:3. `As the soft fibres of the Ishika reed, when thrown
into the fire, are burnt, thus all his sins are
burnt whoever offers this Agnihotra with a full knowledge
of its true purport.
5-24:4. `Even if he gives what is left of his food to a
Kandala, it would be offered in his (the Kandala's)
Vaisvanara Self. And so it is said in this Sloka:
5-24:5. `Even if he gives what is left of his food to a
`As hungry children here on earth sit (expectantly) round
their mother, so do all beings sit round the
Agnihotra, yea, round the Agnihotra.'

~ Chapter 6 ~
Sixth Prapathaka
Section 1 
First Khanda
6-1:1. Harih, Om. There lived once Svetaketu Aruneya
(the grandson of Aruna). To him his father
(Uddalaka, the son of Aruna) said: `Svetaketu, go to
school; for there is none belonging to our race,
darling, who, not having studied (the Veda), is, as it were,
a Brahmana by birth only.'
6-1:2. Having begun his apprenticeship (with a teacher)
when he was twelve years of age, Svetaketu
returned to his father, when he was twenty-four, having
then studied all the Vedas, conceited,
considering himself well-read, and stern.
6-1:3. His father said to him: `Svetaketu, as you are so
conceited, considering yourself so well-read, and
so stern, my dear, have you ever asked for that
instruction by which we hear what cannot be heard, by
which we perceive what cannot be perceived, by which
we know what cannot be known?'
6-1:4. `What is that instruction, Sir?' he asked.
The father replied: `My dear, as by one clod of clay all
that is made of clay is known, the difference being
only a name, arising from speech, but the truth being that
all is clay;
6-1:5. `And as, my dear, by one nugget of gold all that is
made of gold is known, the difference being
only a name, arising from speech, but the truth being that
all is gold?
6-1:6. `And as, my dear, by one pair of nail-scissors all
that is made of iron (karshnayasam) is known, the
difference being only a name, arising from speech, but
the truth being that all is iron, thus, my dear, is
that instruction.'
6-1:7. The son said: `Surely those venerable men (my
teachers) did not know that. For if they had known
it, why should they not have told it me? Do you, Sir,
therefore tell me that.' `Be it so,' said the father.
Section 2 
Second Khanda
6-2:1. `In the beginning,' my dear, `there was that only
which is {to on, [greek]} one only, without a
second. Others say, in the beginning there was that only
which is not {to me on, [greek]} one only,
without a second; and from that which is not, that which is
was born.
6-2:2. `But how could it be thus, my dear?' the father
continued. `How could that which is, be born of
that which is not? No, my dear, only that which is, was in
the beginning, one only, without a second.
6-2:3. `It thought, may I be many, may I grow forth. It
sent forth fire.
`That fire thought, may I be many, may I grow forth. It
sent forth water.
`And therefore whenever anybody anywhere is hot and
perspires, water is produced on him from fire
alone.
6-2:4. `Water thought, may I be many, may I grow forth.
It sent forth earth (food).
`Therefore whenever it rains anywhere, most food is then
produced. From water alone is eatable food
produced.
Section 3
Third Khanda
6-3:1. `Of all living things there are indeed three origins
only, that which springs from an egg
(oviparous), that which springs from a living being
(viviparous), and that which springs from a germ.
6-3:2. `That Being (i.e. that which had produced fire,
water, and earth) thought, let me now enter those
three beings (fire, water, earth) with this living Self (giva
atma), and let me then reveal (develop) names
and forms. 
6-3:3. `Then that Being having said, Let me make each
of these three tripartite (so that fire, water, and
earth should each have itself for its principal ingredient,
besides an admixture of the other two) entered
into those three beings (devata) with this living self only,
and revealed names and forms.
6-3:4. `He made each of these tripartite; and how these
three beings become each of them tripartite, that
learn from me now, my friend!
Section 4
Fourth Khanda
6-4:1. `The red colour of burning fire (agni) is the colour
of fire, the white colour of fire is the colour of
water, the black colour of fire the colour of earth. Thus
vanishes what we call fire, as a mere variety,
being a name, arising from speech. What is true (satya)
are the three colours (or forms).
6-4:2. `The red colour of the sun (aditya) is the colour of
fire, the white of water, the black of earth. Thus
vanishes what we call the sun, as a mere variety, being a
name, arising from speech. What is true are the
three colours.
6-4:3. `The red colour of the moon is the colour of fire,
the white of water, the black of earth. Thus
vanishes what we call the moon, as a mere variety, being
a name, arising from speech. What is true are
the three colours.
6-4:4. `The red colour of the lightning is the colour of fire,
the white of water, the black of earth. Thus
vanishes what we call the lightning, as a mere variety,
being a name, arising from speech. What is true
are the three colours.
6-4:5. `Great householders and great theologians of
olden times who knew this, have declared the same,
saying, "No one can henceforth mention to us anything
which we have not heard, perceived, or known."
Out of these (three colours or forms) they knew all. 
6-4:6. `Whatever they thought looked red, they knew was
the colour of fire. Whatever they thought
looked white, they knew was the colour of water.
Whatever they thought looked black, they knew was the
colour of earth.
6-4:7. `Whatever they thought was altogether unknown,
they knew was some combination of those three
beings (devata).
Now learn from me, my friend, how those three beings,
when they reach man, become each of them
tripartite.
Section 5
Fifth Khanda
6-5:1. `The earth (food) when eaten becomes threefold;
its grossest portion becomes feces, its middle
portion flesh, its subtilest portion mind.
6-5:2. `Water when drunk becomes threefold; its grossest
portion becomes water, its middle portion
blood, its subtilest portion breath.
6-5:3. `Fire (i.e. in oil, butter, &c.) when eaten becomes
threefold; its grossest portion becomes bone, its
middle portion marrow, its subtilest portion speech.
6-5:4. `For truly, my child, mind comes of earth, breath of
water, speech of fire.'
`Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.
`Be it so, my child,' the father replied.
Section 6
Sixth Khanda
6-6:1. `That which is the subtile portion of curds, when
churned, rises upwards, and becomes butter.
6-6:2. `In the same manner, my child, the subtile portion
of earth (food), when eaten, rises upwards, and
becomes mind.
6-6:3. `That which is the subtile portion of water, when
drunk, rises upwards, and becomes breath.
6-6:4. `That which is the subtile portion of fire, when
consumed, rises upwards, and becomes speech.
6-6:5. `For mind, my child, comes of earth, breath of
water, speech of fire.'
`Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.
`Be it so, my child,' the father replied.
Section 7
Seventh Khanda
6-7:1. `Man (purusha), my son, consists of sixteen parts.
Abstain from food for fifteen days, but drink as
much water as you like, for breath comes from water, and
will not be cut off, if you drink water.'
6-7:2. Svetaketu abstained from food for fifteen days.
Then he came to his father and said: `What shall I
say?' The father said: `Repeat the Rik, Yagus, and
Saman verses.' He replied: `They do not occur to me,
Sir.'
6-7:3. The father said to him: `As of a great lighted fire
one coal only of the size of a firefly may be left,
which would not burn much more than this (i.e. very little),
thus, my dear son, one part only of the sixteen
parts (of you) is left, and therefore with that one part you
do not remember the Vedas. Go and eat!
6-7:4. `Then wilt thou understand me.' Then Svetaketu
ate, and afterwards approached his father. And
whatever his father asked him, he knew it all by heart.
Then his father said to him:
6-7:5. `As of a great lighted fire one coal of the size of a
firefly, if left, may be made to blaze up again by 
putting grass upon it, and will thus burn more than this,
6-7:6. `Thus, my dear son, there was one part of the
sixteen parts left to you, and that, lighted up with
food, burnt up, and by it you remember now the Vedas.'
After that, he understood what his father meant
when he said: `Mind, my son, comes from food, breath
from water, speech from fire.' He understood what
he said, yea, he understood it.
Section 8
Eighth Khanda
6-8:1. Uddalaka Aruni said to his son Svetaketu: `Learn
from me the true nature of sleep (svapna). When
a man sleeps here, then, my dear son, he becomes
united with the True, he is gone to his own (Self).
Therefore they say, svapiti, he sleeps, because he is
gone (apita) to his own (sva).
6-8:2. `As a bird when tied by a string flies first in every
direction, and finding no rest anywhere, settles
down at last on the very place where it is fastened,
exactly in the same manner, my son, that mind (the
giva, or living Self in the mind, see {Kh.} 6, 3, 2), after
flying in every direction, and finding no rest
anywhere, settles down on breath; for indeed, my son,
mind is fastened to breath.
6-8:3. `Learn from me, my son, what are hunger and
thirst. When a man is thus said to be hungry, water
is carrying away (digests) what has been eaten by him.
Therefore as they speak of a cow-leader (go-naya),
a horse-leader (asva-naya), a man-leader (purushanaya), so they call water (which digests food and
causes hunger) food-leader (asa-naya). Thus (by food
digested &c.), my son, know this offshoot (the
body) to be brought forth, for this (body) could not be
without a root (cause).
6-8:4. `And where could its root be except in food
(earth)? And in the same manner, my son, as food
(earth) too is an offshoot, seek after its root, viz. water.
And as water too is an offshoot, seek after its root, 
viz. fire. And as fire too is an offshoot, seek after its root,
viz. the True. Yes, all these creatures, my son,
have their root in the True, they dwell in the True, they
rest in the True.
6-8:5. `When a man is thus said to be thirsty, fire carries
away what has been drunk by him. Therefore as
they speak of a cow-leader (go-naya), of a horse-leader
(asva-naya), of a man-leader (purusha-naya), so
they call fire udanya, thirst, i.e. water-leader. Thus (by
water digested &c.), my son, know this offshoot
(the body) to be brought forth: this (body) could not be
without a root (cause).
6-8:6. `And where could its root be except in water? As
water is an offshoot, seek after its root, viz. fire.
As fire is an offshoot, seek after its root, viz. the True.
Yes, all these creatures, O son, have their root in
the True, they dwell in the True, they rest in the True.
`And how these three beings (devata), fire, water, earth,
O son, when they reach man, become each of
them tripartite, has been said before (VI, 4, 7). When a
man departs from hence, his speech is merged in
his mind, his mind in his breath, his breath in heat (fire),
heat in the Highest Being.
6-8:7. `Now that which is that subtile essence (the root of
all), in it all that exists has its self. It is the
True. It is the Self, and thou, O Svetaketu, art it.'
`Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.
`Be it so, my child,' the father replied.
Section 9
Ninth Khanda
6-9:1. `As the bees, my son, make honey by collecting
the juices of distant trees, and reduce the juice into
one form,
6-9:2. `And as these juices have no discrimination, so
that they might say, I am the juice of this tree or 
that, in the same manner, my son, all these creatures,
when they have become merged in the True (either
in deep sleep or in death), know not that they are merged
in the True.
6-9:3. `Whatever these creatures are here, whether a
lion, or a wolf, or a boar, or a worm, or a midge, or a
gnat, or a musquito, that they become again and again.
6-9:4. `Now that which is that subtile essence, in it all
that exists has its self. It is the True. It is the Self,
and thou, O Svetaketu, art it.'
`Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.
`Be it so, my child,' the father replied.
Section 10
Tenth Khanda
6-10:1. `These rivers, my son, run, the eastern (like the
Ganga) toward the east, the western (like the
Sindhu) toward the west. They go from sea to sea (i.e.
the clouds lift up the water from the sea to the sky,
and send it back as rain to the sea). They become
indeed sea. And as those rivers, when they are in the
sea, do not know, I am this or that river,
6-10:2. `In the same manner, my son, all these creatures,
when they have come back from the True, know
not that they have come back from the True. Whatever
these creatures are here, whether a lion, or a wolf,
or a boar, or a worm, or a midge, or a gnat, or a musquito,
that they become again and again.
6-10:3. `That which is that subtile essence, in it all that
exists has its self. It is the True. It is the Self,
and thou, O Svetaketu, art it.'
`Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.
`Be it so, my child,' the father replied.
Section 11 
Eleventh Khanda
6-11:1. `If some one were to strike at the root of this
large tree here, it would bleed, but live. If he were to
strike at its stem, it would bleed, but live. If he were to
strike at its top, it would bleed, but live. Pervaded
by the living Self that tree stands firm, drinking in its
nourishment and rejoicing;
6-11:2. `But if the life (the living Self leaves one of its
branches, that branch withers; if it leaves a second,
that branch withers; if it leaves a third, that branch
withers. If it leaves the whole tree, the whole tree
withers. In exactly the same manner, my son, know this.'
Thus he spoke:
6-11:3. `This (body) indeed withers and dies when the
living Self has left it; the living Self dies not.
`That which is that subtile essence, in it all that exists has
its self. It is the True. It is the Self, and thou,
Svetaketu, art it.'
`Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.
`Be it so, my child,' the father replied.
Section 12
Twelfth Khanda
6-12:1. `Fetch me from thence a fruit of the Nyagrodha
tree.'
`Here is one, Sir.'
`Break it.'
`It is broken, Sir.'
`What do you see there?'
`These seeds, almost infinitesimal.'
`Break one of them.' 
`It is broken, Sir.'
`What do you see there?'
`Not anything, Sir.'
6-12:2. The father said: `My son, that subtile essence
which you do not perceive there, of that very
essence this great Nyagrodha tree exists.
6-12:3. `Believe it, my son. That which is the subtile
essence, in it all that exists has its self. It is the
True. It is the Self, and thou, O Svetaketu, art it.'
`Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.
`Be it so, my child,' the father replied.
Section 13
Thirteenth Khanda
6-13:1. `Place this salt in water, and then wait on me in
the morning.'
The son did as he was commanded.
The father said to him: `Bring me the salt, which you
placed in the water last night.'
The son having looked for it, found it not, for, of course, it
was melted.
6-13:2. The father said: `Taste it from the surface of the
water. How is it?'
The son replied: `It is salt.'
`Taste it from the middle. How is it?'
The son replied: `It is salt.'
`Taste it from the bottom. How is it?'
The son replied `It is salt.' 
The father said: `Throw it away and then wait on me.'
He did so; but salt exists for ever.
Then the father said: `Here also, in this body, forsooth,
you do not perceive the True (Sat), my son; but
there indeed it is.
6-13:3. `That which is the subtile essence, in it all that
exists has its self. It is the True. It is the Self,
and thou, O Svetaketu, art it.'
`Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.
`Be it so, my child,' the father replied.
Section 14
Fourteenth Khanda
6-14:1. `As one might lead a person with his eyes
covered away from the Gandharas, and leave him then
in a place where there are no human beings; and as that
person would turn towards the east, or the north,
or the west, and shout, "I have been brought here with my
eyes covered, I have been left here with my eyes
covered,"
6-14:2. `And as thereupon some one might loose his
bandage and say to him, "Go in that direction, it is
Gandhara, go in that direction;" and as thereupon, having
been informed and being able to judge for
himself, he would by asking his way from village to village
arrive at last at Gandhara, in exactly the
same manner does a man, who meets with a teacher to
inform him, obtain the true knowledge. For him
there is only delay so long as he is not delivered (from the
body); then he will be perfect.
6-14:3. `That which is the subtile essence, in it all that
exists has its self. It is the True. It is the Self,
and thou, O Svetaketu, art it.'
`Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.
`Be it so, my child,' the father replied. 
Section 15
Fifteenth Khanda
6-15:1. `If a man is ill, his relatives assemble round him
and ask: "Dost thou know me? Dost thou know
me?" Now as long as his speech is not merged in his
mind, his mind in breath, breath in heat (fire), heat
in the Highest Being (devata), he knows them.
6-15:2. `But when his speech is merged in his mind, his
mind in breath, breath in heat (fire), heat in the
Highest Being, then he knows them not.
`That which is the subtile essence, in it all that exists has
its self. It is the True. It is the Self, and thou, O
Svetaketu, art it.'
`Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.
`Be it so, my child,' the father replied.
Section 16
Sixteenth Khanda
6-16:1. `My child, they bring a man hither whom they
have taken by the hand, and they say: "He has
taken something, he has committed a theft." (When he
denies, they say), "Heat the hatchet for him." If
he committed the theft, then he makes himself to be what
he is not. Then the false-minded, having
covered his true Self by a falsehood, grasps the heated
hatchet he is burnt, and he is killed.
6-16:2. `But if he did not commit the theft, then he makes
himself to be what he is. Then the trueminded, having covered his true Self by truth, grasps the
heated hatchet he is not burnt, and he is
delivered.
`As that (truthful) man is not burnt, thus has all that exists
its self in That. It is the True. It is the Self,
and thou, O Svetaketu, art it.' He understood what he
said, yea, he understood it. 

~ Chapter 7 ~
Seventh Prapathaka
Section 1
First Khanda
7-1:1. Narada approached Sanatkumara and said,
`Teach me, Sir!' Sanatkumara said to him: `Please to
tell me what you know; afterward I shall tell you what is
beyond.'
7-1:2. Narada said: `I know the Rig-veda, Sir, the Yagurveda, the Sama-veda, as the fourth the
Atharvana, as the fifth the Itihasa-purana (the Bharata);
the Veda of the Vedas (grammar); the Pitrya (the
rules for the sacrifices for the ancestors); the Rasi (the
science of numbers); the Daiva (the science of
portents); the Nidhi (the science of time); the Vakovakya
(logic); the Ekayana (ethics); the Deva-vidya
(etymology); the Brahma-vidya (pronunciation, siksha,
ceremonial, kalpa, prosody, khandas); the Bhutavidya (the science of demons); the Kshatra-vidya (the
science of weapons); the Nakshatra-vidya
(astronomy); the Sarpa and Devagana-vidya (the science
of serpents or poisons, and the sciences of the
genii, such as the making of perfumes, dancing, singing,
playing, and other fine arts). All this I know, Sir.
7-1:3. `But, Sir, with all this I know the Mantras only, the
sacred books, I do not know the Self. I have
heard from men like you, that he who knows the Self
overcomes grief. I am in grief. Do, Sir, help me
over this grief of mine.'
Sanatkumara said to him: `Whatever you have read, is
only a name.
7-1:4. `A name is the Rig-veda, Yagur-veda, Sama-veda,
and as the fourth the Atharvana, as the fifth the
Itihasa-purana, the Veda of the Vedas, the Pitrya, the
Rasi, the Daiva, the Nidhi, the Vakovakya, the 
Ekayana, the Deva-vidya, the Brahma-vidya, the Bhutavidya, the Kshatra-vidya, the Nakshatra-vidya, the
Sarpa and Devagana-vidya. All these are a name only.
Meditate on the name.
7-1:5. `He who meditates on the name as Brahman, is,
as it were, lord and master as far as the name
reaches he who meditates on the name as Brahman.'
`Sir, is there something better than a name?'
`Yes, there is something better than a name.'
`Sir, tell it me.'
Section 2
Second Khanda
7-2:1. `Speech is better than a name. Speech makes us
understand the Rig-veda, Yagur-veda, Samaveda, and as the fourth the Atharvana, as the fifth the
Itihasa-purana, the Veda of the Vedas, the Pitrya,
the Rasi, the Daiva, the Nidhi, the Vakovakya, the
Ekayana, the Deva-vidya, the Brahma-vidya, the
Kshatra-vidya, the Nakshatra-vidya, the Sarpa and
Devagana-vidya; heaven, earth, air, ether, water, fire,
gods, men, cattle, birds, herbs, trees, all beasts down to
worms, midges, and ants; what is right and what
is wrong; what is true and what is false; what is good and
what is bad; what is pleasing and what is not
pleasing. For if there were no speech, neither right nor
wrong would be known, neither the true nor the
false, neither the good nor the bad, neither the pleasant
nor the unpleasant. Speech makes us understand
all this. Meditate on speech.
7-2:2. `He who meditates on speech as Brahman, is, as
it were, lord and master as far as speech reaches
he who meditates on speech as Brahman.'
`Sir, is there something better than speech?'
`Yes, there is something better than speech.'
`Sir, tell it me.' 
Section 3
Third Khanda
7-3:1. `Mind (manas) is better than speech. For as the
closed fist holds two amalaka or two kola or two
aksha fruits, thus does mind hold speech and name. For
if a man is minded in his mind to read the sacred
hymns, he reads them; if he is minded in his mind to
perform any actions, he performs them; if he is
minded to wish for sons and cattle, he wishes for them; if
he is minded to wish for this world and the
other, he wishes for them. For mind is indeed the self,
mind is the world, mind is Brahman. Meditate on
the mind.
7-3:2. `He who meditates on the mind as Brahman, is, as
it were, lord and master as far as the mind
reaches he who meditates on the mind as Brahman.'
`Sir, is there something better than mind?'
`Yes, there is something better than mind.'
`Sir, tell it me.'
Section 4
Fourth Khanda
7-4:1. `Will (sankalpa) is better than mind. For when a
man wills, then he thinks in his mind, then he
sends forth speech, and he sends it forth in a name. In a
name the sacred hymns are contained, in the
sacred hymns all sacrifices.
7-4:2. `All these therefore (beginning with mind and
ending in sacrifice) centre in will, consist of will,
abide in will. Heaven and earth willed, air and ether
willed, water and fire willed. Through the will of
heaven and earth &c. rain wills; through the will of rain
food wills; through the will of food the vital airs
will; through the will of the vital airs the sacred hymns will;
through the will of the sacred hymns the 
sacrifices will; through the will of the sacrifices the world
(as their reward) wills; through the will of the
world everything wills. This is will. Meditate on will.
7-4:3. `He who meditates on will as Brahman, he, being
himself safe, firm, and undistressed, obtains the
safe, firm, and undistressed worlds which he has willed;
he is, as it were, lord and master as far as will
reaches he who meditates on will as Brahman.'
`Sir, is there something better than will?'
`Yes, there is something better than will.'
`Sir, tell it me.'
Section 5
Fifth Khanda
7-5:1. `Consideration (kitta) is better than will. For when
a man considers, then he wills, then he thinks
in his mind, then he sends forth speech, and he sends it
forth in a name. In a name the sacred hymns are
contained, in the sacred hymns all sacrifices.
7-5:2. `All these (beginning with mind and ending in
sacrifice) centre in consideration, consist of
consideration, abide in consideration. Therefore if a man
is inconsiderate, even if he possesses much
learning, people say of him, he is nothing, whatever he
may know; for, if he were learned, he would not be
so inconsiderate. But if a man is considerate, even
though he knows but little, to him indeed do people
listen gladly. Consideration is the centre, consideration is
the self, consideration is the support of all
these. Meditate on consideration.
7-5:3. `He who meditates on consideration as Brahman,
he, being himself safe, firm, and undistressed,
obtains the safe, firm, and undistressed worlds which he
has considered; he is, as it were, lord and master
as far as consideration reaches he who meditates on
consideration as Brahman.'
`Sir, is there something better than consideration?' 
`Yes, there is something better than consideration.'
`Sir, tell it me.'
Section 6
Sixth Khanda
7-6:1. `Reflection (dhyana) is better than consideration.
The earth reflects, as it were, and thus does the
sky, the heaven, the water, the mountains, gods and
men. Therefore those who among men obtain
greatness here on earth, seem to have obtained a part of
the object of reflection (because they show a
certain repose of manner). Thus while small and vulgar
people are always quarrelling, abusive, and
slandering, great men seem to have obtained a part of
the reward of reflection. Meditate on reflection.
7-6:2. `He who meditates on reflection as Brahman, is
lord and master, as it were, as far as reflection
reaches he who meditates on reflection as Brahman.'
`Sir, is there something better than reflection?'
`Yes, there is something better than reflection.'
`Sir, tell it me.'
Section 7
Seventh Khanda
7-7:1. `Understanding (vignana) is better than reflection.
Through understanding we understand the Rigveda, the Yagur-veda, the Sama-veda, and as the fourth
the Atharvana, as the fifth the Itihasa-purana, the
Veda of the Vedas, the Pitrya, the Rasi, the Daiva, the
Nidhi, the Vakovakya, the Ekayana, the Devavidya, the Brahma-vidya, the Bhuta-vidya, the Kshatravidya the Nakshatra-vidya, the Sarpa and
Devagana-vidya, heaven, earth, air, ether, water, fire,
gods, men, cattle, birds, herbs, trees, all beasts down
to worms, midges, and ants; what is right and what is
wrong; what is true and what is false; what is good 
and what is bad; what is pleasing and what is not
pleasing; food and savour, this world and that, all this
we understand through understanding. Meditate on
understanding.
7-7:2. `He who meditates on understanding as Brahman,
reaches the worlds where there is understanding
and knowledge; he is, as it were, lord and master as far
as understanding reaches he who meditates on
understanding as Brahman.'
`Sir, is there something better than understanding?'
`Yes, there is something better than understanding.'
`Sir, tell it me.'
Section 8
Eighth Khanda
7-8:1. `Power (bala) is better than understanding. One
powerful man shakes a hundred men of
understanding. If a man is powerful, he becomes a rising
man. If he rises, he becomes a man who visits
wise people. If he visits, he becomes a follower of wise
people. If he follows them, he becomes a seeing, a
hearing, a perceiving, a knowing, a doing, an
understanding man. By power the earth stands firm, and
the sky, and the heaven, and the mountains, gods and
men, cattle, birds, herbs, trees, all beasts down to
worms, midges, and ants; by power the world stands firm.
Meditate on power.
7-8:2. `He who meditates on power as Brahman, is, as it
were, lord and master as far as power reaches
he who meditates on power as Brahman.'
`Sir, is there something better than power?'
`Yes, there is something better than power.'
`Sir, tell it me.'
Section 9 
Ninth Khanda
7-9:1. `Food (anna) is better than power. Therefore if a
man abstain from food for ten days, though he
live, he would be unable to see, hear, perceive, think, act,
and understand. But when he obtains food, he
is able to see, hear, perceive, think, act, and understand.
Meditate on food.
7-9:2. `He who meditates on food as Brahman, obtains
the worlds rich in food and drink; he is, as it were,
lord and master as far as food reaches he who
meditates on food as Brahman.'
`Sir, is there something better than food?'
`Yes, there is something better than food.'
`Sir, tell it me.'
Section 10
Tenth Khanda
7-10:1. `Water (ap) is better than food. Therefore if there
is not sufficient rain, the vital spirits fail from
fear that there will be less food. But if there is sufficient
rain, the vital spirits rejoice, because there will
be much food. This water, on assuming different forms,
becomes this earth, this sky, this heaven, the
mountains, gods and men, cattle, birds, herbs and trees,
all beasts down to worms, midges, and ants.
Water indeed assumes all these forms. Meditate on
water.
7-10:2. `He who meditates on water as Brahman, obtains
all wishes, he becomes satisfied; he is, as it
were, lord and master as far as water reaches he who
meditates on water as Brahman.'
`Sir, is there something better than water?'
`Yes, there is something better than water.'
`Sir, tell it me.' 
Section 11
Eleventh Khanda
7-11:1. `Fire (tegas) is better than water. For fire united
with air, warms the ether. Then people say, It is
hot, it burns, it will rain. Thus does fire, after showing this
sign (itself) first, create water. And thus
again thunderclaps come with lightnings, flashing
upwards and across the sky. Then people say, There is
lightning and thunder, it will rain. Then also does fire,
after showing this sign first, create water.
Meditate on fire.
7-11:2. `He who meditates on fire as Brahman, obtains,
resplendent himself, resplendent worlds, full of
light and free of darkness; he is, as it were, lord and
master as far as fire reaches he who meditates on
fire as Brahman.'
`Sir, is there something better than fire?'
`Yes, there is something better than fire.'
`Sir, tell it me.'
Section 12
Twelfth Khanda
7-12:1. `Ether (or space) is better than fire. For in the
ether exist both sun and moon, the lightning, stars,
and fire (agni). Through the ether we call, through the
ether we hear, through the ether we answer. In
the ether or space we rejoice (when we are together), and
rejoice not (when we are separated). In the ether
everything is born, and towards the ether everything
tends when it is born. Meditate on ether.
7-12:2. `He who meditates on ether as Brahman, obtains
the worlds of ether and of light, which are free
from pressure and pain, wide and spacious; he is, as it
were, lord and master as far as ether reaches he
who meditates on ether as Brahman.'
`Sir, is there something better than ether?' 
`Yes, there is something better than ether.'
`Sir, tell it me.'
Section 13
Thirteenth Khanda
7-13:1. `Memory (smara) is better than ether. Therefore
where many are assembled together, if they have
no memory, they would hear no one, they would not
perceive, they would not understand. Through
memory we know our sons, through memory our cattle.
Meditate on memory.
7-13:2. `He who meditates on memory as Brahman, is,
as it were, lord and master as far as memory
reaches he who meditates on memory as Brahman.'
`Sir, is there something better than memory?'
`Yes, there is something better than memory.'
`Sir, tell it me.'
Section 14
Fourteenth Khanda
7-14:1. `Hope (asa) is better than memory. Fired by
hope does memory read the sacred hymns, perform
sacrifices, desire sons and cattle, desire this world and
the other. Meditate on hope.
7-14:2. `He who meditates on hope as Brahman, all his
desires are fulfilled by hope, his prayers are not in
vain; he is, as it were, lord and master as far as hope
reaches he who meditates on hope as Brahman.'
`Sir, is there something better than hope?'
`Yes, there is something better than hope.'
`Sir, tell it me.' 
Section 15
Fifteenth Khanda
7-15:1. `Spirit (prana) is better than hope. As the spokes
of a wheel hold to the nave, so does all this
(beginning with names and ending in hope) hold to spirit.
That spirit moves by the spirit, it gives spirit to
the spirit. Father means spirit, mother is spirit, brother is
spirit, sister is spirit, tutor is spirit, Brahmana is
spirit.
7-15:2. `For if one says anything unbecoming to a father,
mother, brother, sister, tutor or Brahmana, then
people say, Shame on thee! thou hast offended thy
father, mother, brother, sister, tutor, or a Brahmana.
7-15:3. `But, if after the spirit has departed from them,
one shoves them together with a poker, and burns
them to pieces, no one would say, Thou offendest thy
father, mother, brother, sister, tutor or a Brahmana.
7-15:4. `Spirit then is all this. He who sees this,
perceives this, and understands this, becomes an
ativadin. If people say to such a man, Thou art an
ativadin, he may say, I am an ativadin; he need not
deny it.'
Section 16
Sixteenth Khanda
7-16:1. `But in reality he is an ativadin who declares the
Highest Being to be the True (Satya, {to ontos
on [greek]}).'
`Sir, may I become an ativadin by the True?'
`But we must desire to know the True.'
`Sir, I desire to know the True.'
Section 17
Seventeenth Khanda 
7-17:1. `When one understands the True, then one
declares the True. One who does not understand it,
does not declare the True. Only he who understands it,
declares the True. This understanding, however,
we must desire to understand.'
`Sir, I desire to understand it.'
Section 18
Eighteenth Khanda
7-18:1. `When one perceives, then one understands.
One who does not perceive, does not understand.
Only he who perceives, understands. This perception,
however, we must desire to understand.'
`Sir, I desire to understand it.'
Section 19
Nineteenth Khanda
7-19:1. `When one believes, then one perceives. One
who does not believe, does not perceive. Only he
who believes, perceives. This belief, however, we must
desire to understand.'
`Sir, I desire to understand it.'
Section 20
Twentieth Khanda
7-20:1. `When one attends on a tutor (spiritual guide),
then one believes. One who does not attend on a
tutor, does not believe. Only he who attends, believes.
This attention on a tutor, however, we must desire
to understand.'
`Sir, I desire to understand it.'
Section 21
Twenty-First Khanda 
7-21:1. `When one performs all sacred duties, then one
attends really on a tutor. One who does not
perform his duties, does not really attend on a tutor. Only
he who performs his duties, attends on his
tutor. This performance of duties, however, we must
desire to understand.'
`Sir, I desire to understand it.'
Section 22
Twenty-Second Khanda
7-22:1. `When one obtains bliss (in oneself), then one
performs duties. One who does not obtain bliss,
does not perform duties. Only he who obtains bliss,
performs duties. This bliss, however, we must desire
to understand.'
`Sir, I desire to understand it.'
Section 23
Twenty-Third Khanda
7-23:1. `The Infinite (bhuman) is bliss. There is no bliss
in anything finite. Infinity only is bliss. This
Infinity, however, we must desire to understand.'
`Sir, I desire to understand it.'
Section 24
Twenty-Fourth Khanda
7-24:1. `Where one sees nothing else, hears nothing
else, understands nothing else, that is the Infinite.
Where one sees something else, hears something else,
understands something else, that is the finite. The
Infinite is immortal, the finite is mortal.'
`Sir, in what does the Infinite rest?'
`In its own greatness or not even in greatness.'
7-24:2. `In the world they call cows and horses,
elephants and gold, slaves, wives, fields and houses
greatness. I do not mean this,' thus he spoke; `for in that
case one being (the possessor) rests in something
else, (but the Infinite cannot rest in something different
from itself.)
Section 25
Twenty-Fifth Khanda
7-25:1. `The Infinite indeed is below, above, behind,
before, right and left it is indeed all this.
`Now follows the explanation of the Infinite as the I: I am
below, I am above, I am behind, before, right
and left I am all this.
7-25:2. `Next follows the explanation of the Infinite as the
Self: Self is below, above, behind, before, right
and left Self is all this.
`He who sees, perceives, and understands this, loves the
Self, delights in the Self, revels in the Self,
rejoices in the Self he becomes a Svarag, (an autocrat
or self-ruler); he is lord and master in all the
worlds.
`But those who think differently from this, live in
perishable worlds, and have other beings for their
rulers.
Section 26
Twenty-Sixth Khanda
7-26:1. `To him who sees, perceives, and understands
this, the spirit (prana) springs from the Self, hope
springs from the Self, memory springs from the Self; so
do ether, fire, water, appearance and
disappearance, food, power, understanding, reflection,
consideration, will, mind, speech, names, sacred
hymns, and sacrifices aye, all this springs from the Self.
7-26:2. `There is this verse, "He who sees this, does not
see death, nor illness, nor pain; he who sees this, 
sees everything, and obtains everything everywhere.
`"He is one (before creation), he becomes three (fire,
water, earth), he becomes five, he becomes seven, he
becomes nine; then again he is called the eleventh, and
hundred and ten and one thousand and twenty."
`When the intellectual aliment has been purified, the
whole nature becomes purified. When the whole
nature has been purified, the memory becomes firm. And
when the memory (of the Highest Self) remains
firm, then all the ties (which bind us to a belief in anything
but the Self) are loosened.
`The venerable Sanatkumara showed to Narada, after his
faults had been rubbed out, the other side of
darkness. They call Sanatkumara Skanda, yea, Skanda
they call him.'

~ Chapter 8 ~
Eighth Prapathaka
Section 1
First Khanda
8-1:1. Harih, Om. There is this city of Brahman (the
body), and in it the palace, the small lotus (of the
heart), and in it that small ether. Now what exists within
that small ether, that is to be sought for, that is
to be understood.
8-1:2. And if they should say to him: `Now with regard to
that city of Brahman, and the palace in it, i.e.
the small lotus of the heart, and the small ether within the
heart, what is there within it that deserves to be
sought for, or that is to be understood?'
8-1:3. Then he should say: `As large as this ether (all
space) is, so large is that ether within the heart.
Both heaven and earth are contained within it, both fire
and air, both sun and moon, both lightning and 
stars; and whatever there is of him (the Self) here in the
world, and whatever is not (i.e. whatever has
been or will be), all that is contained within it.'
8-1:4. And if they should say to him: `If everything that
exists is contained in that city of Brahman, all
beings and all desires (whatever can be imagined or
desired), then what is left of it, when old age reaches
it and scatters it, or when it falls to pieces?'
8-1:5. Then he should say: `By the old age of the body,
that (the ether, or Brahman within it) does not
age; by the death of the body, that (the ether, or Brahman
within it) is not killed. That (the Brahman) is
the true Brahma-city (not the body). In it all desires are
contained. It is the Self, free from sin, free from
old age, from death and grief, from hunger and thirst,
which desires nothing but what it ought to desire,
and imagines nothing but what it ought to imagine. Now
as here on earth people follow as they are
commanded, and depend on the object which they are
attached to, be it a country or a piece of land,
8-1:6. `And as here on earth, whatever has been
acquired by exertion, perishes, so perishes whatever is
acquired for the next world by sacrifices and other good
actions performed on earth. Those who depart
from hence without having discovered the Self and those
true desires, for them there is no freedom in all
the worlds. But those who depart from hence, after
having discovered the Self and those true desires, for
them there is freedom in all the worlds.
Section 2
Second Khanda
8-2:1. `Thus he who desires the world of the fathers, by
his mere will the fathers come to receive him,
and having obtained the world of the fathers, he is happy.
8-2:2. `And he who desires the world of the mothers, by
his mere will the mothers come to receive him,
and having obtained the world of the mothers, he is
happy. 
8-2:3. `And he who desires the world of the brothers, by
his mere will the brothers come to receive him,
and having obtained the world of the brothers, he is
happy.
8-2:4. `And he who desires the world of the sisters, by
his mere will the sisters come to receive him, and
having obtained the world of the sisters, he is happy.
8-2:5. `And he who desires the world of the friends, by
his mere will the friends come to receive him, and
having obtained the world of the friends, he is happy.
8-2:6. `And he who desires the world of perfumes and
garlands (gandhamalya), by his mere will
perfumes and garlands come to him, and having obtained
the world of perfumes and garlands, he is
happy.
8-2:7. `And he who desires the world of food and drink,
by his mere will food and drink come to him,
and having obtained the world of food and drink, he is
happy.
8-2:8. `And he who desires the world of song and music,
by his mere will song and music come to him,
and having obtained the world of song and music, he is
happy.
8-2:9. `And he who desires the world of women, by his
mere will women come to receive him, and
having obtained the world of women, he is happy.
`Whatever object he is attached to, whatever object he
desires, by his mere will it comes to him, and
having obtained it, he is happy.
Section 3
Third Khanda
8-3:1. `These true desires, however, are hidden by what
is false; though the desires be true, they have a
covering which is false. Thus, whoever belonging to us
has departed this life, him we cannot gain back,
so that we should see him with our eyes. 
8-3:2. `Those who belong to us, whether living or
departed, and whatever else there is which we wish for
and do not obtain, all that we find there (if we descend
into our heart, where Brahman dwells, in the ether
of the heart). There are all our true desires, but hidden by
what is false. As people who do not know the
country, walk again and again over a gold treasure that
has been hidden somewhere in the earth and do
not discover it, thus do all these creatures day after day
go into the Brahma-world (they are merged in
Brahman, while asleep), and yet do not discover it,
because they are carried away by untruth (they do not
come to themselves, i.e. they do not discover the true
Self in Brahman, dwelling in the heart).
8-3:3. `That Self abides in the heart. And this is the
etymological explanation. The heart is called hridayam, instead of hridy-ayam, i.e. He who is in the heart.
He who knows this, that He is in the heart, goes
day by day (when in sushupti, deep sleep) into heaven
(svarga), i.e. into the Brahman of the heart.
8-3:4. `Now that serene being which, after having risen
from out this earthly body, and having reached
the highest light (self-knowledge), appears in its true
form, that is the Self,' thus he spoke (when asked by
his pupils). This is the immortal, the fearless, this is
Brahman. And of that Brahman the name is the
True, Satyam,
8-3:5. This name Sattyam consists of three syllables, satti-yam. Sat signifies the immortal, t, the mortal,
and with yam he binds both. Because he binds both, the
immortal and the mortal, therefore it is yam. He
who knows this goes day by day into heaven (svarga).
Section 4
Fourth Khanda
8-4:1. That Self is a bank, a boundary, so that these
worlds may not be confounded. Day and night do not
pass that bank, nor old age, death, and grief; neither
good nor evil deeds. All evil-doers turn back from it,
for the world of Brahman is free from all evil. 
8-4:2. Therefore he who has crossed that bank, if blind,
ceases to be blind; if wounded, ceases to be
wounded; if afflicted, ceases to be afflicted. Therefore
when that bank has been crossed, night becomes
day indeed, for the world of Brahman is lighted up once
for all.
8-4:3. And that world of Brahman belongs to those only
who find it by abstinence for them there is
freedom in all the worlds.
Section 5
Fifth Khanda
8-5:1. What people call sacrifice (yagna), that is really
abstinence (brahmakarya). For he who knows,
obtains that (world of Brahman, which others obtain by
sacrifice), by means of abstinence.
What people call sacrifice (ishta), that is really abstinence,
for by abstinence, having searched (ishtva), he
obtains the Self.
8-5:2. What people call sacrifice (sattrayana), that is
really abstinence, for by abstinence he obtains from
the Sat (the true), the safety (trana) of the Self.
What people call the vow of silence (mauna), that is really
abstinence, for he who by abstinence has found
out the Self, meditates (manute).
8-5:3. What people call fasting (anasakayana), that is
really abstinence, for that Self does not perish (na
nasyati), which we find out by abstinence.
What people call a hermit's life (aranyayana), that is really
abstinence. Ara and Nya are two lakes in the
world of Brahman, in the third heaven from hence; and
there is the lake Airammadiya, and the Asvattha
tree, showering down Soma, and the city of Brahman
(Hiranyagarbha) Aparagita, and the golden Prabhuvimita (the hall built by Prabhu, Brahman).
Now that world of Brahman belongs to those who find the
lakes Ara and Nya in the world of Brahman by
means of abstinence; for them there is freedom in all the
worlds.
Section 6
Sixth Khanda
8-6:1. Now those arteries of the heart consist of a brown
substance, of a white, blue, yellow, and red
substance, and so is the sun brown, white, blue, yellow,
and red.
8-6:2. As a very long highway goes to two places, to one
at the beginning, and to another at the end, so
do the rays of the sun go to both worlds, to this one and
to the other. They start from the sun, and enter
into those arteries; they start from those arteries, and
enter into the sun.
8-6:3. And when a man is asleep, reposing, and at
perfect rest, so that he sees no dream, then he has
entered into those arteries. Then no evil touches him, for
he has obtained the light (of the sun).
8-6:4. And when a man falls ill, then those who sit round
him, say, `Do you know me? Do you know
me?' As long as he has not departed from this body, he
knows them.
8-6:5. But when he departs from this body, then he
departs upwards by those very rays (towards the
worlds which he has gained by merit, not by knowledge);
or he goes out while meditating on Om (and
thus securing an entrance into the Brahma-loka). And
while his mind is failing, he is going to the sun.
For the sun is the door of the world (of Brahman). Those
who know, walk in; those who do not know, are
shut out. There is this verse:
8-6:6. `There are a hundred and one arteries of the
heart; one of them penetrates the crown of the head;
moving upwards by it a man reaches the immortal; the
others serve for departing in different directions,
yea, in different directions.' 
Section 7
Seventh Khanda
8-7:1. Pragapati said: `The Self which is free from sin,
free from old age, from death and grief, from
hunger and thirst, which desires nothing but what it ought
to desire, and imagines nothing but what it
ought to imagine, that it is which we must search out, that
it is which we must try to understand. He who
has searched out that Self and understands it, obtains all
worlds and all desires.'
8-7:2. The Devas (gods) and Asuras (demons) both
heard these words, and said: `Well, let us search for
that Self by which, if one has searched it out, all worlds
and all desires are obtained.'
Thus saying Indra went from the Devas, Virokana from
the Asuras, and both, without having
communicated with each other, approached Pragapati,
holding fuel in their hands, as is the custom for
pupils approaching their master.
8-7:3. They dwelt there as pupils for thirty-two years.
Then Pragapati asked them: `For what purpose
have you both dwelt here?'
They replied: `A saying of yours is being repeated, viz.
"the Self which is free from sin, free from old age,
from death and grief, from hunger and thirst, which
desires nothing but what it ought to desire, and
imagines nothing but what it ought to imagine, that it is
which we must search out, that it is which we
must try to understand. He who has searched out that
Self and understands it, obtains all worlds and all
desires." Now we both have dwelt here because we wish
for that Self.'
8-7:1. Pragapati said to them: `The person that is seen in
the eye, that is the Self. This is what I have
said. This is the immortal, the fearless, this is Brahman.'
They asked: `Sir, he who is perceived in the water, and
he who is perceived in a mirror, who is he?' 
He replied: `He himself indeed is seen in all these.'
Section 8
Eighth Khanda
8-8:1. `Look at your Self in a pan of water, and whatever
you do not understand of your Self, come and
tell me.'
They looked in the water-pan. Then Pragapati said to
them: `What do you see?'
They said: `We both see the self thus altogether, a picture
even to the very hairs and nails.'
8-8:2. Pragapati said to them: `After you have adorned
yourselves, have put on your best clothes and
cleaned yourselves, look again into the water-pan.'
They, after having adorned themselves, having put on
their best clothes and cleaned themselves, looked
into the water-pan.
Pragapati said: `What do you see?'
8-8:3. They said: `Just as we are, well adorned, with our
best clothes and clean, thus we are both there,
Sir, well adorned, with our best clothes and clean.'
Pragapati said: `That is the Self, this is the immortal, the
fearless, this is Brahman.'
Then both went away satisfied in their hearts.
8-8:4. And Pragapati, looking after them, said: `They
both go away without having perceived and without
having known the Self, and whoever of these two,
whether Devas or Asuras, will follow this doctrine
(upanishad), will perish.'
Now Virokana, satisfied in his heart, went to the Asuras
and preached that doctrine to them, that the self
(the body) alone is to be worshipped, that the self (the
body) alone is to be served, and that he who 
worships the self and serves the self, gains both worlds,
this and the next.
8-8:5. Therefore they call even now a man who does not
give alms here, who has no faith, and offers no
sacrifices, an Asura, for this is the doctrine (upanishad) of
the Asuras. They deck out the body of the dead
with perfumes, flowers, and fine raiment by way of
ornament, and think they will thus conquer that world.
Section 9
Ninth Khanda
8-9:1. But Indra, before he had returned to the Devas,
saw this difficulty. As this self (the shadow in the
water) is well adorned, when the body is well adorned,
well dressed, when the body is well dressed, well
cleaned, if the body is well cleaned, that self will also be
blind, if the body is blind, lame, if the body is
lame, crippled, if the body is crippled, and will perish in
fact as soon as the body perishes. Therefore I see
no good in this (doctrine).
8-9:2. Taking fuel in his hand he came again as a pupil to
Pragapati. Pragapati said to him: `Maghavat
(Indra), as you went away with Virokana, satisfied in your
heart, for what purpose did you come back?'
He said: `Sir, as this self (the shadow) is well adorned,
when the body is well adorned, well dressed, when
the body is well dressed, well cleaned, if the body is well
cleaned, that self will also be blind, if the body is
blind, lame, if the body is lame, crippled, if the body is
crippled, and will perish in fact as soon as the
body perishes. Therefore I see no good in this (doctrine).'
8-9:3. `So it is indeed, Maghavat,' replied Pragapati; `but
I shall explain him (the true Self) further to
you. Live with me another thirty-two years.'
He lived with him another thirty-two years, and then
Pragapati said:
Section 10 
Tenth Khanda
8-10:1. `He who moves about happy in dreams, he is the
Self, this is the immortal, the fearless, this is
Brahman.'
Then Indra went away satisfied in his heart. But before
he had returned to the Devas, he saw this
difficulty. Although it is true that that self is not blind,
even if the body is blind, nor lame, if the body is
lame, though it is true that that self is not rendered faulty
by the faults of it (the body),
8-10:2. Nor struck when it (the body) is struck, nor lamed
when it is lamed, yet it is as if they struck him
(the self) in dreams, as if they chased him. He becomes
even conscious, as it were, of pain, and sheds
tears. Therefore I see no good in this.
8-10:3. Taking fuel in his hands, he went again as a pupil
to Pragapati. Pragapati said to him:
`Maghavat, as you went away satisfied in your heart, for
what purpose did you come back?'
He said: `Sir, although it is true that that self is not blind
even if the body is blind, nor lame, if the body is
lame, though it is true that that self is not rendered faulty
by the faults of it (the body),
8-10:4. Nor struck when it (the body) is struck, nor lamed
when it is lamed, yet it is as if they struck him
(the self) in dreams, as if they chased him. He becomes
even conscious, as it were, of pain, and sheds
tears. Therefore I see no good in this.'
`So it is indeed, Maghavat,' replied Pragapati; `but I shall
explain him (the true Self) further to you. Live
with me another thirty-two years.'
He lived with him another thirty-two years. Then
Pragapati said:
Section 11
Eleventh Khanda 
8-11:1. `When a man being asleep, reposing, and at
perfect rest, sees no dreams, that is the Self, this is
the immortal, the fearless, this is Brahman.'
Then Indra went away satisfied in his heart. But before
he had returned to the Devas, he saw this
difficulty. In truth he thus does not know himself (his self)
that he is I, nor does he know anything that
exists. He is gone to utter annihilation. I see no good in
this.
8-11:2. Taking fuel in his hand he went again as a pupil
to Pragapati. Pragapati said to him: `Maghavat,
as you went away satisfied in your heart, for what
purpose did you come back?'
He said: `Sir, in that way he does not know himself (his
self) that he is I, nor does he know anything that
exists. He is gone to utter annihilation. I see no good in
this.'
8-11:3. `So it is indeed, Maghavat,' replied Pragapati; but
I shall explain him (the true Self ) further to
you, and nothing more than this. Live here other five
years.'
He lived there other five years. This made in all one
hundred and one years, and therefore it is said that
Indra Maghavat lived one hundred and one years as a
pupil with Pragapati. Pragapati said to him:
Section 12
Twelfth Khanda
8-12:1. `Maghavat, this body is mortal and always held
by death. It is the abode of that Self which is
immortal and without body. When in the body (by
thinking this body is I and I am this body) the Self is
held by pleasure and pain. So long as he is in the body,
he cannot get free from pleasure and pain. But
when he is free of the body (when he knows himself
different from the body), then neither pleasure nor
pain touches him.
8-12:2. `The wind is without body, the cloud, lightning,
and thunder are without body (without hands,
feet, &c.) Now as these, arising from this heavenly ether
(space), appear in their own form, as soon as
they have approached the highest light,
8-12:3. `Thus does that serene being, arising from this
body, appear in its own form, as soon as it has
approached the highest light (the knowledge of Self). He
(in that state) is the highest person (uttama
purusha). He moves about there laughing (or eating),
playing, and rejoicing (in his mind), be it with
women, carriages, or relatives, never minding that body
into which he was born.
`Like as a horse attached to a cart, so is the spirit (prana,
pragnatman) attached to this body.
8-12:4. `Now where the sight has entered into the void
(the open space, the black pupil of the eye), there
is the person of the eye, the eye itself is the instrument of
seeing. He who knows, let me smell this, he is
the Self, the nose is the instrument of smelling. He who
knows, let me say this, he is the Self, the tongue
is the instrument of saying. He who knows, let me hear
this, he is the Self, the ear is the instrument of
hearing.
8-12:5. `He who knows, let me think this, he is the Self,
the mind is his divine eye. He, the Self, seeing
these pleasures (which to others are hidden like a buried
treasure of gold) through his divine eye, i.e. the
mind, rejoices.
`The Devas who are in the world of Brahman meditate on
that Self (as taught by Pragapati to Indra, and
by Indra to the Devas). Therefore all worlds belong to
them, and all desires. He who knows that Self and
understands it, obtains all worlds and all desires.' Thus
said Pragapati, yea, thus said Pragapati.
Section 13
Thirteenth Khanda
8-13:1. From the dark (the Brahman of the heart) I come
to the nebulous (the world of Brahman), from
the nebulous to the dark, shaking off all evil, as a horse
shakes his hairs, and as the moon frees herself
from the mouth of Rahu. Having shaken off the body, I
obtain, self made and satisfied, the uncreated
world of Brahman, yea, I obtain it.
Section 14
Fourteenth Khanda
8-14:1. He who is called ether (akasa) is the revealer of
all forms and names. That within which these
forms and names are contained is the Brahman, the
Immortal, the Self.
I come to the hall of Pragapati, to the house; I am the
glorious among Brahmans, glorious among princes,
glorious among men. I obtained that glory, I am glorious
among the glorious. May I never go to the
white, toothless, yet devouring, white abode; may I never
go to it.
Section 15
Fifteenth Khanda
8-15:1. Brahma (Hiranyagarbha or Paramesvara) told
this to Pragapati (Kasyapa), Pragapati to Manu (his
son), Manu to mankind. He who has learnt the Veda from
a family of teachers, according to the sacred
rule, in the leisure time left from the duties to be
performed for the Guru, who, after receiving his
discharge, has settled in his own house, keeping up the
memory of what he has learnt by repeating it
regularly in some sacred spot, who has begotten virtuous
sons, and concentrated all his senses on the Self,
never giving pain to any creature, except at the tirthas
(sacrifices, &c.), he who behaves thus all his life,
reaches the world of Brahman, and does not return, yea,
he does not return.

5-10:8. Note: In this manner all the five questions have
been answered. First why in the fifth oblation
water is called man; secondly, to what place men go after
death, some by the path of the Devas, others by
the path of the fathers, others again by neither of these
paths; thirdly, how they return, some returning to
Brahman, others returning to the earth; fourthly, where
the paths of the Devas and the fathers diverge,
viz. when from the half-year the path of the Devas goes
on to the year, while that of the fathers branches
off to the world of the fathers; fifthly, why that world, the
other world, does never become full, viz.
because men either go on to Brahman or return again to
this world.
Many questions are raised among Indian philosophers on
the exact meaning of certain passages occuring
in the preceding paragraphs. First, as to who is admitted
to the path of the Devas? Householders, who
know the secret doctrine of the five fires or the five
libations of the Agnihotra, as described above, while
other householders, who only perform the ordinary
sacrifices, without a knowledge of their secret
meaning, go by the path of the fathers. Secondly, those
who have retired to the forest, and whose worship
there consists in faith and austerities, i.e. Vanaprasthas
and Parivragakas, before they arrive at a
knowledge of the true Brahman. The question then
arises, whether religious students also enter the path
of the Devas? This is affirmed, because Puranas and
Smritis assert it, or because our text, if properly
understood, does not exclude it. Those, on the contrary
who know not only a conditioned, but the highest
unconditioned Brahman, do not proceed on the path of
the Devas, but obtain Brahman immediately.
Again, there is much difference of opinion whether, after a
man has been in the moon, consuming his
works, he can be born again. Birth is the result of former
works, and if former works are altogether
consumed, there cna be no new birth. This, however, is
shown to be an erroneous view, because, besides
the good sacrificial works, the fruits of which are
consumed in the moon, there are other works which
have to be enjoyed or expiated, as the case may be, in a
new existence. 
The great difficulty or danger in the round of
transmigration arises when the rain has fructified the
earth,
and passes into herbs and trees, rice, corn, and beans.
For, first of all, some of the rain does not fructify at
once, but falls into rivers and into the sea, to be
swallowed up by the fishes and sea monsters. Then, only
after these have been dissolved in the sea, and after the
sea water has been attracted by the clouds, the rain
falls down again, it may be on desert or stony land. Here
it may be swallowed by snakes or deer, and these
may be swallowed by other animals, so that the round of
existence seems endless. Nor is this all. Some
rain may dry up, or be absorbed by bodies that cannot be
eaten. Then, if the rain is absorbed by rice, corn,
&c., and this be eaten, it may be eaten by children or by
men who have renounced marriage, and thus
again lose the chance of a new birth. Lastly there is the
danger arising from the nature of the being in
whom the food, such as rice and corn, becomes a new
seed, and likewise from the nature of the mother.
All these chances have to be met before a new birth as a
Brahmana, Kshatriya, or Vaisya can be secured.
Another curious distinction is here made by Sankara in
his commentary. There are some, he says, who
assume the form of rice, corn, &c., not in their descent
from the higher world, as described in the
Upanishad, but as a definite punishment for certain evil
deeds they have committed. These remain in that
state till the results of their evil deeds are over, and
assume then a new body, according to their work, like
caterpillars. With them there is also a consciousness of
these states, and the acts which caused them to
assume this or that body, leave impressions behind, like
dreams. This is not the case with those who in
their descent from the moon, pass, as we saw, through
an existence as rice, corn, &c. They have no
consciousness of such existences, at least not in their
descent. In their ascent to the moon, they have
consciousness, as a man who climbs up a tree knows
what he is about. But in their descent, that
consciouysness is gone, as it is when a man falls down
from a tree. Otherwise a man, who by his good 
works had deserved rewards in the moon, would while
corn is being ground, suffer tortures, as if he were
in hell, and the very object of good works, as taught by
the Veda, would be defeated. As we see that a
man struck by a hammer can be carried away
unconscious, so it is in the descent of souls, till they are
born
again as men, and gain a new start for attainment of the
Highest Brahman.
