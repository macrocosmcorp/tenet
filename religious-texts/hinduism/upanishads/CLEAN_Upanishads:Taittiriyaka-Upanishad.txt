First Valli Or, The Chapter on Siksha (pronunciation)
Section 1
First Anuvaka
1-1:1. HARIH, Om! May Mitra be propitious to us, and
Varuna, Aryaman also, Indra, Brihaspati, and 
the wide-striding Vishnu.
Adoration to Brahman! Adoration to thee, O Vayu (air)!
Thou indeed art the visible Brahman. I shall
proclaim thee alone as the visible Brahman. I shall
proclaim the right. I shall proclaim the true (scil.
Brahman).
(1-5) May it protect me! May it protect the teacher! yes,
may it protect me, and may it protect the
teacher! Om! Peace! peace! peace!
Section 2
Second Anuvaka
1-2:1. Om! Let us explain Siksha, the doctrine of
pronunciation, viz. letter, accent, quantity, effort (in the
formation of letters), modulation, and union of letters
(sandhi). This is the lecture on Siksha.
Section 3
Third Anuvaka
1-3:1. May glory come to both of us (teacher and pupil)
together! May Vedic light belong to both of us!
Now let us explain the Upanishad (the secret meaning) of
the union (samhita), under five heads, with
regard to the worlds, the heavenly lights, knowledge,
offspring, and self (body). People call these the
great Samhitas.
First, with regard to the worlds. The earth is the former
element, heaven the latter, ether their union;
1-3:2. That union takes place through Vayu (air). So
much with regard to the worlds.
Next, with regard to the heavenly lights. Agni (fire) is the
former element, Aditya (the sun) the latter,
water their union. That union takes place through
lightning. So much with regard to the heavenly lights.
Next, with regard to knowledge. The teacher is the
former element,
1-3:3. The pupil the latter, knowledge their union. That
union takes place through the recitation of the
Veda. So much with regard to knowledge.
Next, with regard to offspring. The mother is the former
element, the father the latter, offspring their
union. That union takes place through procreation. So
much with regard to offspring.
1-3:4. Next, with regard to the self (body). The lower jaw
is the former element, the upper jaw the latter,
speech their union. That union takes place through
speech. So much with regard to the Self. These are
the great Samhitas. He who knows these Samhitas
(unions), as here explained, becomes united with
offspring, cattle, Vedic light, food, and with the heavenly
world.
Section 4
Fourth Anuvaka
1-4:1. May he who is the strong bull of the Vedas,
assuming all forms, who has risen from the Vedas,
from the Immortal, may that Indra (lord) strengthen me
with wisdom! May I, O God, become an
upholder of the Immortal!
May my body be able, my tongue sweet, may I hear much
with my ears! Thou (Om) art the shrine (of
Brahman), covered by wisdom. Guard what I have learnt.
She (Sri, happiness) brings near and spreads,
1-4:2. And makes, without delay, garments for herself,
cows, food, and drink at all times; therefore bring
that Sri (happiness) hither to me, the woolly, with her
cattle! Svaha! May the Brahman-students come to
me, Svaha! May they come from all sides, Svaha! May
they come forth to me, Svaha! May they practise
restraint, Svaha! May they enjoy peace, Svaha!
1-4:3. May I be a glory among men, Svaha! May I be
better than the richest, Svaha! May I enter into
thee, O treasure (Om), Svaha! Thou, O treasure, enter
into me, Svaha! In thee, consisting of a thousand
branches, in thee, O treasure, I am cleansed, Svaha! As
water runs downward, as the months go to the
year, so, O preserver of the world, may Brahmanstudents always come to me from all sides, Svaha!
(1) Thou art a refuge! Enlighten me! Take possession of
me!
Section 5
Fifth Anuvaka
1-5:1. Bhu, Bhuvas, Suvas, these are the three sacred
interjections (vyahriti). Mahakamasya taught a
fourth, viz. Mahas, which is Brahman, which is the Self.
The others (devatas) are its members.
Bhu is this world, Bhuvas is the sky, Suvas is the other
world.
1-5:2. Mahas is the sun. All the worlds are increased by
the sun. Bhu is Agni (fire), Bhuvas is Vayu
(air), Suvas is Aditya (sun). Mahas is the moon. All the
heavenly lights are increased by the moon.
Bhu is the Rik-verses, Bhuvas is the Saman-verses,
Suvas is the Yagus-verses.
1-5:3. Mahas is Brahman. All the Vedas are increased
by the Brahman.
(1-2) Bhu is Prana (up-breathing), Bhuvas is Apana
(down-breathing), Suvas is Vyana (back-breathing).
Mahas is food. All breathings are increased by food.
Thus there are these four times four, the four and four
sacred interjections. He who knows these,
(1-2) Knows the Brahman. All Devas bring offerings to
him.
Section 6 
Sixth Anuvaka
1-6:1. There is the ether within the heart, and in it there is
the Person (purusha) consisting of mind,
immortal, golden.
Between the two palates there hangs the uvula, like a
nipple that is the starting-point of Indra (the
lord). Where the root of the hair divides, there he opens
the two sides of the head, and saying Bhu, he
enters Agni (the fire); saying Bhuvas, he enters Vayu
(air);
1-6:2. Saying Suvas, he enters Aditya (sun); saying
Mahas, he enters Brahman. He there obtains
lordship, he reaches the lord of the mind. He becomes
lord of speech, lord of sight, lord of hearing, lord
of knowledge. Nay, more than this. There is the
Brahman whose body is ether, whose nature is true,
rejoicing in the senses (prana), delighted in the mind,
perfect in peace, and immortal.
(1) Worship thus, O Prakinayogya!
Section 7
Seventh Anuvaka
1-7:1. `The earth, the sky, heaven, the four quarters, and
the intermediate quarters,' `Agni (fire), Vayu
(air), Aditya (sun), Kandramas (moon), and the stars,'
`Water, herbs, trees, ether, the universal Self
(virag),'- so much with reference to material objects
(bhuta).
Now with reference to the self (the body): `Prana (upbreathing), Apana (down-breathing), Vyana (backbreathing), Udana (out-breathing), and Samana (onbreathing),' `The eye, the ear, mind, speech, and
touch,'- `The skin, flesh, muscle, bone, and marrow.'
Having dwelt on this (fivefold arrangement of the
worlds, the gods, beings, breathings, senses, and
elements of the body), a Rishi said: `Whatever exists is
fivefold (pankta).' 
(1) By means of the one fivefold set (that referring to the
body) he completes the other fivefold set.
Section 8
Eighth Anuvaka
1-8:1. Om means Brahman.
1-8:2. Om means all this.
1-8:3. Om means obedience. When they have been told,
`Om, speak,' they speak.
1-8:4. After Om they sing Samans.
1-8:5. After Om they recite hymns.
1-8:6. After Om the Adhvaryu gives the response.
1-8:7. After Om the Brahman-priest gives orders.
1-8:8. After Om he (the sacrificer) allows the
performance of the Agnihotra.
1-8:9. When a Brahmana is going to begin his lecture, he
says,
1-8:10. `Om, may I acquire Brahman (the Veda).' He
thus acquires the Veda.
Section 9
Ninth Anuvaka
1-9:1. (What is necessary?) The right, and learning and
practising the Veda. The true, and learning and
practising the Veda. Penance, and learning and
practising the Veda. Restraint, and learning and
practising the Veda. Tranquillity, and learning and
practising the Veda. The fires (to be consecrated),
and learning and practising the Veda. The Agnihotra
sacrifice, and learning and practising the Veda.
Guests (to be entertained), and learning and practising
the Veda. Man's duty, and learning and 
practising the Veda. Children, and learning and
practising the Veda.
(1-6) Marriage, and learning and practising the Veda.
Children's children, and learning and practising
the Veda.
Satyavakas Rathitara thinks that the true only is
necessary. Taponitya Paurasishti thinks that penance
only is necessary. Naka Maudgalya thinks that learning
and practising the Veda only are necessary,
for that is penance, that is penance.
Section 10
Tenth Anuvaka
1-10:1. `I am he who shakes the tree (i.e. the tree of the
world, which has to be cut down by knowledge).
1-10:2. My glory is like the top of a mountain.
1-10:3. I, whose pure light (of knowledge) has risen high,
am that which is truly immortal, as it resides in
the sun.
1-10:4. I am the brightest treasure.
1-10:5. I am wise, immortal, imperishable.'
1-10:6. This is the teaching of the Veda, by the poet
Trisanku.
Section 11
Eleventh Anuvaka
1-11:1. After having taught the Veda, the teacher
instructs the pupil: `Say what is true! Do thy duty! Do
not neglect the study of the Veda! After having brought to
thy teacher his proper reward, do not cut off
the line of children! Do not swerve from the truth! Do not
swerve from duty! Do not neglect what is
useful! Do not neglect greatness! Do not neglect the
learning and teaching of the Veda! 
1-11:2. `Do not neglect the (sacrificial) works due to the
Gods and Fathers! Let thy mother be to thee
like unto a god! Let thy father be to thee like unto a god!
Let thy teacher be to thee like unto a god! Let
thy guest be to thee like unto a god! Whatever actions
are blameless, those should be regarded, not others.
Whatever good works have been performed by us, those
should be observed by thee,
1-11:3. `Not others. And there are some Brahmanas
better than we. They should be comforted by thee
by giving them a seat. Whatever is given should be given
with faith, not without faith, with joy, with
modesty, with fear, with kindness. If there should be any
doubt in thy mind with regard to any sacred act
or with regard to conduct,
1-11:4. `In that case conduct thyself as Brahmanas who
possess good judgment conduct themselves
therein, whether they be appointed or not, as long as they
are not too severe, but devoted to duty. And
with regard to things that have been spoken against, as
Brahmanas who possess good judgment conduct
themselves therein, whether they be appointed or not, as
long as they are not too severe, but devoted to
duty,
(1-7) Thus conduct thyself. `This is the rule. This is the
teaching. This is the true purport (Upanishad)
of the Veda. This is the command. Thus should you
observe. Thus should this be observed.'
Section 12
Twelfth Anuvaka
1-12:1. May Mitra be propitious to us, and Varuna,
Aryaman also, Indra, Brihaspati, and the widestriding Vishnu! Adoration to Brahman! Adoration to
thee, O Vayu! Thou indeed art the visible
Brahman. I proclaimed thee alone as the visible
Brahman.
(1-5) I proclaimed the right. I proclaimed the true. It
protected me. It protected the teacher. Yes, it 
protected me, it protected the teacher. Om! Peace!
peace! peace!

~ Chapter 2 ~
Second Valli Or, The Chapter on Ananda (bliss)
{Prayer}
Harih, Om! May it (the Brahman) protect us both (teacher
and pupil)! May it enjoy us both! May we
acquire strength together! May our knowledge become
bright! May we never quarrel! Peace! peace!
peace!
Section 1
First Anuvaka
He who knows the Brahman attains the highest
(Brahman). On this the following verse is recorded:
`He who knows Brahman, which is (i.e. cause, not
effect), which is conscious, which is without end, as
hidden in the depth (of the heart), in the highest ether, he
enjoys all blessings, at one with the omniscient
Brahman.'
From that Self (Brahman) sprang ether (akasa, that
through which we hear); from ether air (that through
which we hear and feel); from air fire (that through which
we hear, feel, and see); from fire water (that
through which we hear, feel, see, and taste); from water
earth (that through which we hear, feel, see, taste,
and smell). From earth herbs, from herbs food, from food
seed, from seed man. Man thus consists of the
essence of food. This is his head, this his right arm, this
his left arm, this his trunk (atman), this the seat
(the support).
On this there is also the following Sloka: 
Section 2
Second Anuvaka
`From food are produced all creatures which dwell on
earth. Then they live by food, and in the end they
return to food. For food is the oldest of all beings, and
therefore it is called panacea (sarvaushadha, i.e.
consisting of all herbs, or quieting the heat of the body of
all beings).'
They who worship food as Brahman, obtain all food. For
food is the oldest of all beings, and therefore it
is called panacea. From food all creatures are produced;
by food, when born, they grow. Because it is fed
on, or because it feeds on beings, therefore it is called
food (anna).
Different from this, which consists of the essence of food,
is the other, the inner Self, which consists of
breath. The former is filled by this. It also has the shape
of man. Like the human shape of the former is
the human shape of the latter. Prana (up-breathing) is its
head. Vyana (back-breathing) is its right arm.
Apana (down-breathing) is its left arm. Ether is its trunk.
The earth the seat (the support).
On this there is also the following Sloka:
Section 3
Third Anuvaka
`The Devas breathe after breath (prana), so do men and
cattle. Breath is the life of beings, therefore it is
called sarvayusha (all-enlivening).'
They who worship breath as Brahman, obtain the full life.
For breath is the life of all beings, and
therefore it is called sarvayusha. The embodied Self of
this (consisting of breath) is the same as that of the
former (consisting of food).
Different from this, which consists of breath, is the other,
the inner Self, which consists of mind. The 
former is filled by this. It also has the shape of man. Like
the human shape of the former is the human
shape of the latter. Yagus is its head. Rik is its right arm.
Saman is its left arm. The doctrine (adesa, i.e.
the Brahmana) is its trunk. The Athar-vangiras (Atharvahymns) the seat (the support).
On this there is also the following Sloka:
Section 4
Fourth Anuvaka
`He who knows the bliss of that Brahman, from whence
all speech, with the mind, turns away unable to
reach it, he never fears.' The embodied Self of this
(consisting of mind) is the same as that of the former
(consisting of breath).
Different from this, which consists of mind, is the other,
the inner Self, which consists of understanding.
The former is filled by this. It also has the shape of man.
Like the human shape of the former is the
human shape of the latter. Faith is its head. What is right
is its right arm. What is true is its left arm.
Absorption (yoga) is its trunk. The great (intellect?) is the
seat (the support).
On this there is also the following Sloka:
Section 5
Fifth Anuvaka
`Understanding performs the sacrifice, it performs all
sacred acts. All Devas worship understanding as
Brahman, as the oldest. If a man knows understanding
as Brahman, and if he does not swerve from it, he
leaves all evils behind in the body, and attains all his
wishes.' The embodied Self of this (consisting of
understanding) is the same as that of the former
(consisting of mind).
Different from this, which consists of understanding, is the
other inner Self, which consists of bliss. The 
former is filled by this. It also has the shape of man. Like
the human shape of the former is the human
shape of the latter. Joy is its head. Satisfaction its right
arm. Great satisfaction is its left arm. Bliss is its
trunk. Brahman is the seat (the support).
On this there is also the following Sloka:
Section 6
Sixth Anuvaka
`He who knows the Brahman as non-existing, becomes
himself non-existing. He who knows the Brahman
as existing, him we know himself as existing.' The
embodied Self of this (bliss) is the same as that of the
former (understanding).
Thereupon follow the questions of the pupil:
`Does any one who knows not, after he has departed this
life, ever go to that world? Or does he who
knows, after he has departed, go to that world?'
The answer is: He wished, may I be many, may I grow
forth. He brooded over himself (like a man
performing penance). After he had thus brooded, he sent
forth (created) all, whatever there is. Having
sent forth, he entered into it. Having entered it, he
became sat (what is manifest) and tyat (what is not
manifest), defined and undefined, supported and not
supported, (endowed with) knowledge and without
knowledge (as stones), real and unreal. The Sattya (true)
became all this whatsoever, and therefore the
wise call it (the Brahman) Sat-tya (the true).
On this there is also this Sloka:
Section 7
Seventh Anuvaka
`In the beginning this was non-existent (not yet defined by
form and name). From it was born what
exists. That made itself its Self, therefore it is called the
Self-made.' That which is Self-made is a flavour 
(can be tasted), for only after perceiving a flavour can any
one perceive pleasure. Who could breathe, who
could breathe forth, if that bliss (Brahman) existed not in
the ether (in the heart)? For he alone causes
blessedness.
When he finds freedom from fear and rest in that which is
invisible, incorporeal, undefined, unsupported,
then he has obtained the fearless. For if he makes but
the smallest distinction in it, there is fear for him.
But that fear exists only for one who thinks himself wise,
(not for the true sage.)
On this there is also this Sloka:
Section 8
Eighth Anuvaka
2-8:1 `From terror of it (Brahman) the wind blows, from
terror the sun rises; from terror of it Agni and
Indra, yea Death runs as the fifth.'
Now this is an examination of (what is meant by) Bliss
(ananda):
Let there be a noble young man, who is well read (in the
Veda), very swift, firm, and strong, and let the
whole world be full of wealth for him, that is one measure
of human bliss.
One hundred times that human bliss
2-8:2 is one measure of the bliss of human Gandharvas
(genii), and likewise of a great sage (learned in
the Vedas) who is free from desires.
One hundred times that bliss of human Gandharvas is
one measure of the bliss of divine Gandharvas
(genii), and likewise of a great sage who is free from
desires.
One hundred times that bliss of divine Gandharvas is one
measure of the bliss of the Fathers, enjoying
their long estate, and likewise of a great sage who is free
from desires. 
One hundred times that bliss of the Fathers is one
measure of the bliss of the Devas, born in the Agana
heaven (through the merit of their lawful works),
2-8:3 and likewise of a great sage who is free from
desires.
One hundred times that bliss of the Devas born in the
Agana heaven is one measure of the bliss of the
sacrificial Devas, who go to the Devas by means of their
Vaidik sacrifices, and likewise of a great sage
who is free from desires.
One hundred times that bliss of the sacrificial Devas is
one measure of the bliss of the (thirty-three)
Devas, and likewise of a great sage who is free from
desires.
One hundred times that bliss of the (thirty-three) Devas is
one measure of the bliss of Indra,
2-8:4 and likewise of a great sage who is free from
desires.
One hundred times that bliss of Indra is one measure of
the bliss of Brihaspati, and likewise of a great
sage who is free from desires.
One hundred times that bliss of Brihaspati is one
measure of the bliss of Pragapati, and likewise of a great
sage who is free from desires.
One hundred times that bliss of Pragapati is one measure
of the bliss of Brahman, and likewise of a great
sage who is free from desires.
2-8:5 He who is this (Brahman) in man, and he who is
that (Brahman) in the sun, both are one.
He who knows this, when he has departed this world,
reaches and comprehends the Self which consists of
food, the Self which consists of breath, the Self which
consists of mind, the Self which consists of
understanding, the Self which consists of bliss. 
On this there is also this Sloka:
Section 9
Ninth Anuvaka
`He who knows the bliss of that Brahman, from whence
all speech, with the mind, turns away unable to
reach it, he fears nothing.'
He does not distress himself with the thought, Why did I
not do what is good? Why did I do what is bad?
He who thus knows these two (good and bad), frees
himself. He who knows both, frees himself. This is
the Upanishad.

~ Chapter 3 ~
Third Valli Or, the Chapter of Bhrigu
Harih, Om! May it (the Brahman) protect us both! May it
enjoy us both! May we acquire strength
together! May our knowledge become bright! May we
never quarrel! Peace! peace! peace!
Section 1
First Anuvaka
Bhrigu Varuni went to his father Varuna, saying: `Sir,
teach me Brahman.' He told him this, viz. Food,
breath, the eye, the ear, mind, speech.
Then he said again to him: `That from whence these
beings are born, that by which, when born, they live,
that into which they enter at their death, try to know that.
That is Brahman.'
He performed penance. Having performed penance
Section 2 
Second Anuvaka
He perceived that food is Brahman, for from food these
beings are produced; by food, when born, they
live; and into food they enter at their death.
Having perceived this, he went again to his father Varuna,
saying: `Sir, teach me Brahman.' He said to
him: `Try to know Brahman by penance, for penance is
(the means of knowing) Brahman.'
He performed penance. Having performed penance
Section 3
Third Anuvaka
He perceived that breath is Brahman, for from breath
these beings are born; by breath, when born, they
live; into breath they enter at their death.
Having perceived this, he went again to his father Varuna,
saying: `Sir, teach me Brahman.' He said to
him: `Try to know Brahman by penance, for penance is
(the means of knowing) Brahman.'
He performed penance. Having performed penance
Section 4
Fourth Anuvaka
He perceived that mind (manas) is Brahman, for from
mind these beings are born; by mind, when born,
they live; into mind they enter at their death.
Having perceived this, he went again to his father Varuna,
saying: `Sir, teach me Brahman.' He said to
him: `Try to know Brahman by penance, for penance is
(the means of knowing) Brahman.'
He performed penance. Having performed penance
Section 5
Fifth Anuvaka 
He perceived that understanding (vignana) was Brahman,
for from understanding these beings are born;
by understanding, when born, they live; into
understanding they enter at their death.
Having perceived this, he went again to his father Varuna,
saying: `Sir, teach me Brahman.' He said to
him: `Try to know Brahman by penance, for penance is
(the means of knowing) Brahman.'
He performed penance. Having performed penance
Section 6
Sixth Anuvaka
He perceived that bliss is Brahman, for from bliss these
beings are born; by bliss, when born, they live;
into bliss they enter at their death.
This is the knowledge of Bhrigu and Varuna, exalted in
the highest heaven (in the heart). He who knows
this becomes exalted, becomes rich in food, and able to
eat food (healthy), becomes great by offspring,
cattle, and the splendour of his knowledge (of Brahman),
great by fame.
Section 7
Seventh Anuvaka
Let him never abuse food, that is the rule.
Breath is food, the body eats the food. The body rests on
breath, breath rests on the body. This is the food
resting on food. He who knows this food resting on food,
rests exalted, becomes rich in food, and able to
eat food (healthy), becomes great by offspring, cattle, and
the splendour of his knowledge (of Brahman),
great by fame.
Section 8
Eighth Anuvaka 
Let him never shun food, that is the rule. Water is food,
the light eats the food. The light rests on water,
water rests on light. This is the food resting on food. He
who knows this food resting on food, rests
exalted, becomes rich in food, and able to eat food
(healthy), becomes great by offspring, cattle, and the
splendour of his knowledge (of Brahman), great by fame.
Section 9
Ninth Anuvaka
Let him acquire much food, that is the rule. Earth is food,
the ether eats the food. The ether rests on the
earth, the earth rests on the ether. This is the food
resting on food. He who knows this food resting on
food, rests exalted, becomes rich in food, and able to eat
food (healthy), becomes great by offspring, cattle,
and the splendour of his knowledge (of Brahman), great
by fame.
Section 10
Tenth Anuvaka
3-10:1. Let him never turn away (a stranger) from his
house, that is the rule. Therefore a man should by
all means acquire much food, for (good) people say (to
the stranger): `There is food ready for him.'
If he gives food amply, food is given to him amply.
If he gives food fairly, food is given to him fairly.
If he gives food meanly, food is given to him meanly.
3-10:2. He who knows this, (recognises and worships
Brahman) as possession in speech, as acquisition
and possession in up-breathing (prana) and downbreathing (apana); as action in the hands; as walking in
the feet; as voiding in the anus. These are the human
recognitions (of Brahman as manifested in human
actions). Next follow the recognitions (of Brahman) with
reference to the Devas, viz. as satisfaction in
rain; as power in lightning; 
3-10:3. As glory in cattle; as light in the stars; as
procreation, immortality, and bliss in the member; as
everything in the ether. Let him worship that (Brahman)
as support, and he becomes supported. Let him
worship that (Brahman) as greatness (mahah), and he
becomes great. Let him worship that (Brahman) as
mind, and he becomes endowed with mind.
3-10:4. Let him worship that (Brahman) as adoration, and
all desires fall down before him in adoration.
Let him worship that (Brahman) as Brahman, and he will
become possessed of Brahman. Let him
worship this as the absorption of the gods in Brahman,
and the enemies who hate him will die all around
him, all around him will die the foes whom he does not
love.
He who is this (Brahman) in man, and he who is that
(Brahman) in the sun, both are one.
3-10:5. He who knows this, when he has departed this
world, after reaching and comprehending the Self
which consists of food, the Self which consists of breath,
the Self which consists of mind, the Self which
consists of understanding, the Self which consists of
bliss, enters and takes possession of these worlds, and
having as much food as he likes, and assuming as many
forms as he likes, he sits down singing this
Saman (of Brahman): `Havu, havu, havu!
3-10:6. `I am food (object), I am food, I am food! I am the
eater of food (subject), I am the eater of food, I
am the eater of food! I am the poet (who joins the two
together), I am the poet, I am the poet! I am the
first-born of the Right (rita). Before the Devas I was in the
centre of all that is immortal. He who gives
me away, he alone preserves me: him who eats food, I
eat as food.
`I overcome the whole world, I, endowed with golden
light. He who knows this, (attains all this).' This is
the Upanishad.
