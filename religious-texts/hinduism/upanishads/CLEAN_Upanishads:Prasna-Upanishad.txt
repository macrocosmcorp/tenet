~ Chapter 1 ~
First Question
1:1. Sukesas Bharadvaga, and Saivya Satyakama, and
Sauryayanin Gargya, and Kausalya Asvalayana,
and Bhargava Vaidarbhi, and Kabandhin Katyayana,
these were devoted to Brahman, firm in Brahman,
seeking for the Highest Brahman. They thought that the
venerable Pippalada could tell them all that, and
they therefore took fuel in their hands (like pupils), and
approached him.
1:2. That Rishi said to them: `Stay here a year longer,
with penance, abstinence, and faith; then you may
ask questions according to your pleasure, and if we know
them, we shall tell you all.'
1:3. Then Kabandhin Katyayana approached him and
asked: `Sir, from whence may these creatures be
born?'
1:4. He replied: `Pragapati (the lord of creatures) was
desirous of creatures (pragah). He performed
penance, and having performed penance, he produces a
pair, matter (rayi) and spirit (prana), thinking that
they together should produce creatures for him in many
ways.
1:5. The sun is spirit, matter is the moon. All this, what
has body and what has no body, is matter, and
therefore body indeed is matter. 
1:6. Now Aditya, the sun, when he rises, goes toward the
East, and thus receives the Eastern spirits into
his rays. And when he illuminates the South, the West,
the North, the Zenith, the Nadir, the intermediate
quarters, and everything, he thus receives all spirits into
his rays.
1:7. Thus he rises, as Vaisvanara, (belonging to all men,)
assuming all forms, as spirit, as fire. This has
been said in the following verse:
1:8. (They knew) him who assumes all forms, the golden,
who knows all things, who ascends highest,
alone in his splendour, and warms us; the thousandrayed, who abides in a hundred places, the spirit of all
creatures, the Sun, rises.
1:9. The year indeed is Pragapati, and there are two
paths thereof, the Southern and the Northern. Now
those who here believe in sacrifices and pious gifts as
work done, gain the moon only as their (future)
world, and return again. Therefore the Rishis who desire
offspring, go to the South, and that path of the
Fathers is matter (rayi).
1:10. But those who have sought the Self by penance,
abstinence, faith, and knowledge, gain by the
Northern path Aditya, the sun. This is the home of the
spirits, the immortal, free from danger, the
highest. From thence they do not return, for it is the end.
Thus says the Sloka:
1:11. Some call him the father with five feet (the five
seasons), and with twelve shapes (the twelve
months), the giver of rain in the highest half of heaven;
others again say that the sage is placed in the
lower half, in the chariot with seven wheels and six
spokes.
1:12. The month is Pragapati; its dark half is matter, its
bright half spirit. Therefore some Rishis perform
sacrifice in the bright half, others in the other half.
1:13. Day and Night are Pragapati; its day is spirit, its
night matter. Those who unite in love by day 
waste their spirit, but to unite in love by night is right.
1:14. Food is Pragapati. Hence proceeds seed, and
from it these creatures are born.
1:15. Those therefore who observe this rule of Pragapati
(as laid down in {verse} 13), produce a pair, and
to them belongs this Brahma-world here. But those in
whom dwell penance, abstinence, and truth,
1:16. To them belongs that pure Brahma-world, to them,
namely, in whom there is nothing crooked,
nothing false, and no guile.'

~ Chapter 2 ~
Second Question
2:1. Then Bhargava Vaidarbhi asked him: `Sir, How
many gods keep what has thus been created, how
many manifest this, and who is the best of them?'
2:2. He replied: `The ether is that god, the wind, fire,
water, earth, speech, mind, eye, and ear. These,
when they have manifested (their power), contend and
say: We (each of us) support this body and keep it.
2:3. Then Prana (breath, spirit, life), as the best, said to
them: Be not deceived, I alone, dividing myself
fivefold, support this body and keep it.
2:4. They were incredulous; so he, from pride, did as if
he were going out from above. Thereupon, as he
went out, all the others went out, and as he returned, all
the others returned. As bees go out when their
queen goes out, and return when she returns, thus (did)
speech, mind, eye, and ear; and, being satisfied,
they praise Prana, saying:
2:5. He is Agni (fire), he shines as Surya (sun), he is
Parganya (rain), the powerful (Indra), he is Vayu
(wind), he is the earth, he is matter, he is God he is what
is and what is not, and what is immortal. 
2:6. As spokes in the nave of a wheel, everything is fixed
in Prana, the verses of the Rig-veda, Yagurveda, Sama-veda, the sacrifice, the Kshatriyas, and the
Brahmans.
2:7. As Pragapati (lord of creatures) thou movest about
in the womb, thou indeed art born again. To thee,
the Prana, these creatures bring offerings, to thee who
dwellest with the other pranas (the organs of
sense).
2:8. Thou art the best carrier for the Gods, thou art the
first offering to the Fathers. Thou art the true
work of the Rishis, of the Atharvangiras.
2:9. O Prana, thou art Indra by thy light, thou art Rudra,
as a protector; thou movest in the sky, thou art
the sun, the lord of lights.
2:10. When thou showerest down rain, then, O Prana,
these creatures of thine are delighted, hoping that
there will be food, as much as they desire.
2:11. Thou art a Vratya, O Prana, the only Rishi, the
consumer of everything, the good lord. We are the
givers of what thou hast to consume, thou, O Matarisva,
art our father.
2:12. Make propitious that body of thine which dwells in
speech, in the ear, in the eye, and which
pervades the mind; do not go away!
2:13. All this is in the power of Prana, whatever exists in
the three heavens. Protect us like a mother her
sons, and give us happiness and wisdom.'

~ Chapter 3 ~
Third Question
3:1. Then Kausalya Asvalayana asked: `Sir, whence is
that Prana (spirit) born? How does it come into
this body? And how does it abide, after it has divided
itself? How does it go out? How does it support 
what is without, and how what is within?'
3:2. He replied: `You ask questions more difficult, but you
are very fond of Brahman, therefore I shall tell
it you.
3:3. This Prana (spirit) is born of the Self. Like the
shadow thrown on a man, this (the prana) is spread
out over it (the Brahman). By the work of the mind does it
come into this body.
3:4. As a king commands officials, saying to them: Rule
these villages or those, so does that Prana (spirit)
dispose the other pranas, each for their separate work.
3:5. The Apana (the down-breathing) in the organs of
excretion and generation; the Prana himself dwells
in eye and ear, passing through mouth and nose. In the
middle is the Samana (the on-breathing); it
carries what has been sacrificed as food equally (over the
body), and the seven lights proceed from it.
3:6. The Self is in the heart. There are the 101 arteries,
and in each of them there are a hundred (smaller
veins), and for each of these branches there are 72,000.
In these the Vyana (the back-breathing) moves.
3:7. Through one of them, the Udana (the out-breathing)
leads (us) upwards to the good world by good
work, to the bad world by bad work, to the world of men
by both.
3:8. The sun rises as the external Prana, for it assists the
Prana in the eye. The deity that exists in the
earth, is there in support of man's Apana (downbreathing). The ether between (sun and earth) is the
Samana (on-breathing), the air is Vyana (back-breathing).
3:9. Light is the Udana (out-breathing), and therefore he
whose light has gone out comes to a new birth
with his senses absorbed in the mind.
3:10. Whatever his thought (at the time of death) with
that he goes back to Prana, and the Prana, united
with light, together with the self (the givatma) leads on to
the world, as deserved. 
3:11. He who, thus knowing, knows Prana, his offspring
does not perish, and he becomes immortal.
Thus says the Sloka:
3:12. He who has known the origin, the entry, the place,
the fivefold distribution, and the internal state of
the Prana, obtains immortality, yes, obtains immortality.'

~ Chapter 4 ~
Fourth Question
4:1. Then Sauryayanin Gargya asked: `Sir, What are
they that sleep in this man, and what are they that
are awake in him? What power (deva) is it that sees
dreams? Whose is the happiness? On what do all
these depend?'
4:2. He replied: `O Gargya, As all the rays of the sun,
when it sets, are gathered up in that disc of light,
and as they, when the sun rises again and again, come
forth, so is all this (all the senses) gathered up in
the highest faculty (deva), the mind. Therefore at that
time that man does not hear, see, smell, taste,
touch, he does not speak, he does not take, does not
enjoy, does not evacuate, does not move about. He
sleeps, that is what people say.
4:3. The fires of the pranas are, as it were, awake in that
town (the body). The Apana is the Garhapatya
fire, the Vyana the Anvaharyapakana fire; and because it
is taken out of the Garhapatya fire, which is fire
for taking out, therefore the Prana is the Ahavaniya fire.
4:4. Because it carries equally these two oblations, the
out-breathing and the in-breathing, the Samana is
he (the Hotri priest). The mind is the sacrificer, the Udana
is the reward of the sacrifice, and it leads the
sacrificer every day (in deep sleep) to Brahman.
4:5. There that god (the mind) enjoys in sleep greatness.
What has been seen, he sees again; what has 
been heard, he hears again; what has been enjoyed in
different countries and quarters, he enjoys again;
what has been seen and not seen, heard and not heard,
enjoyed and not enjoyed, he sees it all; he, being
all, sees.
4:6. And when he is overpowered by light, then that god
sees no dreams, and at that time that happiness
arises in his body.
4:7. And, O friend, as birds go to a tree to roost, thus all
this rests in the Highest Atman,
4:8. The earth and its subtile elements, the water and its
subtile elements, the light and its subtile
elements, the air and its subtile elements, the ether and
its subtile elements; the eye and what can be seen,
the ear and what can be heard, the nose and what can be
smelled, the taste and what can be tasted, the
skin and what can be touched, the voice and what can be
spoken, the hands and what can be grasped, the
feet and what can be walked, the mind and what can be
perceived, intellect (buddhi) and what can be
conceived, personality and what can be personified,
thought and what can be thought, light and what can
be lighted up, the Prana and what is to be supported by it.
4:9. For he it is who sees, hears, smells, tastes,
perceives, conceives, acts, he whose essence is
knowledge,
the person, and he dwells in the highest, indestructible
Self,
4:10. He who knows that indestructible being, obtains
(what is) the highest and indestructible, he without
a shadow, without a body, without colour, bright, yes, O
friend, he who knows it, becomes all-knowing,
becomes all. On this there is this Sloka:
4:11. He, O friend, who knows that indestructible being
wherein the true knower, the vital spirits
(pranas), together with all the powers (deva), and the
elements rest, he, being all-knowing, has penetrated
all.'

~ Chapter 5 ~
Fifth Question
5:1. Then Saivya Satyakama asked him: `Sir, if some
one among men should meditate here until death on
the syllable Om, what would he obtain by it?'
5:2. He replied: `O Satyakama, the syllable Om (AUM) is
the highest and also the other Brahman;
therefore he who knows it arrives by the same means at
one of the two.
5:3. If he meditate on one Matra (the A), then, being
enlightened by that only, he arrives quickly at the
earth. The Rik-verses lead him to the world of men, and
being endowed there with penance, abstinence,
and faith, he enjoys greatness.
5:4. If he meditate with two Matras (A+U) he arrives at
the Manas, and is led up by the Yagus-verses to
the sky, to the Soma-world. Having enjoyed greatness in
the Soma-world, he returns again.
5:5. Again, he who meditates with this syllable AUM of
three Matras, on the Highest Person, he comes to
light and to the sun. And as a snake is freed from its skin,
so is he freed from evil. He is led up by the
Saman-verses to the Brahma-world; and from him, full of
life (Hiranyagarbha, the lord of the Satya-loka),
he learns to see the all-pervading, the Highest Person.
And there are these two Slokas:
5:6. The three Matris (A+U+M), if employed separate,
and only joined one to another, are mortal; but in
acts, external, internal, or intermediate, if well performed,
the sage trembles not.
5:7. Through the Rik-verses he arrives at this world,
through the Yagus-verses at the sky, through the
Saman-verses at that which the poets teach, he arrives
at this by means of the Onkara; the wise arrives
at that which is at rest, free from decay, from death, from
fear, the Highest.' 

~ Chapter 6 ~
Sixth Question
6:1. Then Sukesas Bharadvaga asked him, saying: `Sir,
Hiranyanabha, the prince of Kosala, came to me
and asked this question: Do you know the person of
sixteen parts, O Bharadvaga? I said to the prince: I
do not know him; if I knew him, how should I not tell you?
Surely, he who speaks what is untrue withers
away to the very root; therefore I will not say what is
untrue. Then he mounted his chariot and went away
silently. Now I ask you, where is that person?'
6:2. He replied: `Friend, that person is here within the
body, he in whom these sixteen parts arise.
6:3. He reflected: What is it by whose departure I shall
depart, and by whose staying I shall stay?
6:4. He sent forth (created) Prana (spirit); from Prana
Sraddha (faith), ether, air, light, water, earth,
sense, mind, food; from food came vigour, penance,
hymns, sacrifice, the worlds, and in the worlds the
name also.
6:5. As these flowing rivers that go towards the ocean,
when they have reached the ocean, sink into it,
their name and form are broken, and people speak of the
ocean only, exactly thus these sixteen parts of the
spectator that go towards the person (purusha), when
they have reached the person, sink into him, their
name and form are broken, and people speak of the
person only, and he becomes without parts and
immortal. On this there is this verse:
6:6. That person who is to be known, he in whom these
parts rest, like spokes in the nave of a wheel, you
know him, lest death should hurt you.'
6:7. Then he (Pippalada) said to them: `So far do I know
this Highest Brahman, there is nothing higher
than it.' 
6:8. And they praising him, said: `You, indeed, are our
father, you who carry us from our ignorance to
the other shore.'
Adoration to the highest Rishis!
Adoration to the highest Rishis!
Tat sat. Harih, Om!
