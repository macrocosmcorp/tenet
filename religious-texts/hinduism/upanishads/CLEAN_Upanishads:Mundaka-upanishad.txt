First Mundaka
Section 1
First Khanda
1-1:1. Brahma was the first of the Devas, the maker of
the universe, the preserver of the world. He told
the knowledge of Brahman, the foundation of all
knowledge, to his eldest son Atharva. 
1-1:2. Whatever Brahma told Atharvan, that knowledge
of Brahman Atharvan formerly told to Angir; he
told it to Satyavaha Bharadvaga, and Bharadvaga told it
in succession to Angiras.
1-1:3. Saunaka, the great householder, approached
Angiras respectfully and asked: `Sir, what is that
through which, if it is known, everything else becomes
known?'
1-1:4. He said to him: `Two kinds of knowledge must be
known, this is what all who know Brahman tell
us, the higher and the lower knowledge.'
1-1:5. `The lower knowledge is the Rig-veda, Yagurveda, Sama-veda, Atharva-veda, Siksha (phonetics),
Kalpa (ceremonial), Vyakarana (grammar), Nirukta
(etymology), Khandas (metre), Gyotisha (astronomy);
but the higher knowledge is that by which the
Indestructible (Brahman) is apprehended.'
1-1:6. `That which cannot be seen, nor seized, which has
no family and no caste, no eyes nor ears, no
hands nor feet, the eternal, the omnipresent (allpervading), infinitesimal, that which is imperishable, that
it is which the wise regard as the source of all beings.'
1-1:7. `As the spider sends forth and draws in its thread,
as plants grow on the earth, as from every man
hairs spring forth on the head and the body, thus does
everything arise here from the Indestructible.'
1-1:8. `The Brahman swells by means of brooding
(penance); hence is produced matter (food); from
matter breath, mind, the true, the worlds (seven), and
from the works (performed by men in the worlds),
the immortal (the eternal effects, rewards, and
punishments of works).'
1-1:9. `From him who perceives all and who knows all,
whose brooding (penance) consists of knowledge,
from him (the highest Brahman) is born that Brahman,
name, form, and matter (food).'
Section 2 
Second Khanda
1-2:1. This is the truth: the sacrificial works which they
(the poets) saw in the hymns (of the Veda) have
been performed in many ways in the Treta age. Practise
them diligently, ye lovers of truth, this is your
path that leads to the world of good works!
1-2:2. When the fire is lighted and the flame flickers, let a
man offer his oblations between the two
portions of melted butter, as an offering with faith.
1-2:3. If a man's Agnihotra sacrifice is not followed by the
new-moon and full-moon sacrifices, by the
four-months' sacrifices, and by the harvest sacrifice, if it is
unattended by guests, not offered at all, or
without the Vaisvadeva ceremony, or not offered
according to rule, then it destroys his seven worlds.
1-2:4. Kali (black), Karali (terrific), Manogava (swift as
thought), Sulohita (very red), Sudhumravarna
(purple), Sphulingini (sparkling), and the brilliant Visvarupi
(having all forms), all these playing about
are called the seven tongues (of fire).
1-2:5. If a man performs his sacred works when these
flames are shining, and the oblations follow at the
right time, then they lead him as sun-rays to where the
one Lord of the Devas dwells.
1-2:6. Come hither, come hither! the brilliant oblations
say to him, and carry the sacrificer on the rays of
the sun, while they utter pleasant speech and praise him,
saying: `This is thy holy Brahma-world (Svarga),
gained by thy good works.'
1-2:7. But frail, in truth, are those boats, the sacrifices,
the eighteen, in which this lower ceremonial has
been told. Fools who praise this as the highest good, are
subject again and again to old age and death.
1-2:8. Fools dwelling in darkness, wise in their own
conceit, and puffed up with vain knowledge, go
round and round staggering to and fro, like blind men led
by the blind."blind lead blind" 
1-2:9. Children, when they have long lived in ignorance,
consider themselves happy. Because those who
depend on their good works are, owing to their passions,
improvident, they fall and become miserable
when their life (in the world which they had gained by
their good works) is finished.
1-2:10. Considering sacrifice and good works as the
best, these fools know no higher good, and having
enjoyed (their reward) on the height of heaven, gained by
good works, they enter again this world or a
lower one.
1-2:11. But those who practise penance and faith in the
forest, tranquil, wise, and living on alms, depart
free from passion through the sun to where that immortal
Person dwells whose nature is imperishable.
1-2:12. Let a Brahmana, after he has examined all these
worlds which are gained by works, acquire
freedom from all desires. Nothing that is eternal (not
made) can be gained by what is not eternal (made).
Let him, in order to understand this, take fuel in his hand
and approach a Guru who is learned and dwells
entirely in Brahman.
1-2:13. To that pupil who has approached him
respectfully, whose thoughts are not troubled by any
desires, and who has obtained perfect peace, the wise
teacher truly told that knowledge of Brahman
through which he knows the eternal and true Person.

Second Mundka
Section 1
First Khanda
2-1:1. This is the truth. As from a blazing fire sparks,
being like unto fire, fly forth a thousandfold, thus
are various beings brought forth from the Imperishable,
my friend, and return thither also. 
2-1:2. That heavenly Person is without body, he is both
without and within, not produced, without breath
and without mind, pure, higher than the high
Imperishable.
2-1:3. From him (when entering on creation) is born
breath, mind, and all organs of sense, ether, air,
light, water, and the earth, the support of all.
2-1:4. Fire (the sky) is his head, his eyes the sun and the
moon, the quarters his ears, his speech the
Vedas disclosed, the wind his breath, his heart the
universe; from his feet came the earth; he is indeed the
inner Self of all things.
2-1:5. From him comes Agni (fire), the sun being the fuel;
from the moon (Soma) comes rain (Parganya);
from the earth herbs; and man gives seed unto the
woman. Thus many beings are begotten from the
Person (purusha).
2-1:6. From him come the Rik, the Saman, the Yagush,
the Diksha (initiatory rites), all sacrifices and
offerings of animals, and the fees bestowed on priests,
the year too, the sacrificer, and the worlds, in
which the moon shines brightly and the sun.
2-1:7. From him the many Devas too are begotten, the
Sadhyas (genii), men, cattle, birds, the up and
down breathings, rice and corn (for sacrifices), penance,
faith, truth, abstinence, and law.
2-1:8. The seven senses (prana) also spring from him,
the seven lights (acts of sensation), the seven kinds
of fuel (objects by which the senses are lighted), the
seven sacrifices (results of sensation), these seven
worlds (the places of the senses, the worlds determined
by the senses) in which the senses move, which
rest in the cave (of the heart), and are placed there seven
and seven.
2-1:9. Hence come the seas and all the mountains, from
him flow the rivers of every kind; hence come all
herbs and the juice through which the inner Self subsists
with the elements. 
2-1:10. The Person is all this, sacrifice, penance,
Brahman, the highest immortal; he who knows this
hidden in the cave (of the heart), he, O friend, scatters the
knot of ignorance here on earth.
Section 2
Second Khanda
2-2:1. Manifest, near, moving in the cave (of the heart) is
the great Being. In it everything is centred
which ye know as moving, breathing, and blinking, as
being and not-being, as adorable, as the best, that is
beyond the understanding of creatures.
2-2:2. That which is brilliant, smaller than small, that on
which the worlds are founded and their
inhabitants, that is the indestructible Brahman, that is the
breath, speech, mind; that is the true, that is the
immortal. That is to be hit. Hit it, O friend!
2-2:3. Having taken the Upanishad as the bow, as the
great weapon, let him place on it the arrow,
sharpened by devotion! Then having drawn it with a
thought directed to that which is, hit the mark, O
friend, viz. that which is the Indestructible!
2-2:4. Om is the bow, the Self is the arrow, Brahman is
called its aim. It is to be hit by a man who is not
thoughtless; and then, as the arrow (becomes one with
the target), he will become one with Brahman.
2-2:5. In him the heaven, the earth, and the sky are
woven, the mind also with all the senses. Know him
alone as the Self, and leave off other words! He is the
bridge of the Immortal.
2-2:6. He moves about becoming manifold within the
heart where the arteries meet, like spokes fastened
to the nave. Meditate on the Self as Om! Hail to you,
that you may cross beyond (the sea of) darkness!
2-2:7. He who understands all and who knows all, he to
whom all this glory in the world belongs, the 
Self, is placed in the ether, in the heavenly city of
Brahman (the heart). He assumes the nature of mind,
and becomes the guide of the body of the senses. He
subsists in food, in close proximity to the heart. The
wise who understand this, behold the Immortal which
shines forth full of bliss.
2-2:8. The fetter of the heart is broken, all doubts are
solved, all his works (and their effects) perish when
He has been beheld who is high and low (cause and
effect).
2-2:9. In the highest golden sheath there is the Brahman
without passions and without parts. That is
pure, that is the light of lights, that is it which they know
who know the Self.
2-2:10. The sun does not shine there, nor the moon and
the stars, nor these lightnings, and much less this
fire. When he shines, everything shines after him; by his
light all this is lighted.
2-2:11. That immortal Brahman is before, that Brahman
is behind, that Brahman is right and left. It has
gone forth below and above; Brahman alone is all this, it
is the best.

Third Mundka
Section 1
First Khanda
3-1:1. Two birds, inseparable friends, cling to the same
tree. One of them eats the sweet fruit, the other
looks on without eating.
3-1:2. On the same tree man sits grieving, immersed,
bewildered by his own impotence (an-isa). But
when he sees the other lord (isa) contented and knows
his glory, then his grief passes away. 
3-1:3. When the seer sees the brilliant maker and lord (of
the world) as the Person who has his source in
Brahman, then he is wise, and shaking off good and evil,
he reaches the highest oneness, free from
passions;
3-1:4. For he is the Breath shining forth in all beings, and
he who understands this becomes truly wise,
not a talker only. He revels in the Self, he delights in the
Self, and having performed his works
(truthfulness, penance, meditation, &c.) he rests, firmly
established in Brahman, the best of those who
know Brahman.
3-1:5. By truthfulness, indeed, by penance, right
knowledge, and abstinence must that Self be gained; the
Self whom spotless anchorites gain is pure, and like a
light within the body.
3-1:6. The true prevails, not the untrue; by the true the
path is laid out, the way of the gods (devayanah),
on which the old sages, satisfied in their desires, proceed
to where there is that highest place of the True
One.
3-1:7. That (true Brahman) shines forth grand, divine,
inconceivable, smaller than small; it is far beyond
what is far and yet near here, it is hidden in the cave (of
the heart) among those who see it even here.
3-1:8. He is not apprehended by the eye, nor by speech,
nor by the other senses, not by penance or good
works. When a man's nature has become purified by the
serene light of knowledge, then he sees him,
meditating on him as without parts.
3-1:9. That subtle Self is to be known by thought (ketas)
there where breath has entered fivefold; for
every thought of men is interwoven with the senses, and
when thought is purified, then the Self arises.
3-1:10. Whatever state a man whose nature is purified
imagines, and whatever desires he desires (for
himself or for others), that state he conquers and those
desires he obtains. Therefore let every man who
desires happiness worship the man who knows the Self. 
Section 2
Second Khanda
3-2:1. He (the knower of the Self) knows that highest
home of Brahman, in which all is contained and
shines brightly. The wise who, without desiring
happiness, worship that Person, transcend this seed,
(they
are not born again.)
3-2:2. He who forms desires in his mind, is born again
through his desires here and there. But to him
whose desires are fulfilled and who is conscious of the
true Self (within himself) all desires vanish, even
here on earth.
3-2:3. That Self cannot be gained by the Veda, nor by
understanding, nor by much learning. He whom
the Self chooses, by him the Self can be gained. The
Self chooses him (his body) as his own.
3-2:4. Nor is that Self to be gained by one who is
destitute of strength, or without earnestness, or without
right meditation. But if a wise man strives after it by those
means (by strength, earnestness, and right
meditation), then his Self enters the home of Brahman.
3-2:5. When they have reached him (the Self), the sages
become satisfied through knowledge, they are
conscious of their Self, their passions have passed away,
and they are tranquil. The wise, having reached
Him who is omnipresent everywhere, devoted to the Self,
enter into him wholly.
3-2:6. Having well ascertained the object of the
knowledge of the Vedanta, and having purified their
nature by the Yoga of renunciation, all anchorites,
enjoying the highest immortality, become free at the
time of the great end (death) in the worlds of Brahma.
3-2:7. Their fifteen parts enter into their elements, their
Devas (the senses) into their (corresponding)
Devas. Their deeds and their Self with all his knowledge
become all one in the highest Imperishable. 
3-2:8. As the flowing rivers disappear in the sea, losing
their name and their form, thus a wise man, freed
from name and form, goes to the divine Person, who is
greater than the great.
3-2:9. He who knows that highest Brahman, becomes
even Brahman. In his race no one is born ignorant
of Brahman. He overcomes grief, he overcomes evil; free
from the fetters of the heart, he becomes
immortal.
3-2:10. And this is declared by the following Rik-verse:
`Let a man tell this science of Brahman to those
only who have performed all (necessary) acts, who are
versed in the Vedas, and firmly established in (the
lower) Brahman, who themselves offer as an oblation the
one Rishi (Agni), full of faith, and by whom the
rite of (carrying fire on) the head has been performed,
according to the rule (of the Atharvanas).'
3-2:11. The Rishi Angiras formerly told this true
(science); a man who has not performed the (proper)
rites, does not read it. Adoration to the highest Rishis!
Adoration to the highest Rishis!
