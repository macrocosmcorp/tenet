First Adhyaya
Section 1
First Brahmana
1-1:1. Verily the dawn is the head of the horse which is fit
for sacrifice, the sun its eye, the wind its breath,
the mouth the Vaisvanara fire, the year the body of the
sacrificial horse. Heaven is the back, the sky the
belly, the earth the chest, the quarters the two sides, the
intermediate quarters the ribs, the members the
seasons, the joints the months and half-months, the feet
days and nights, the bones the stars, the flesh the
clouds. The half-digested food is the sand, the rivers the
bowels, the liver and the lungs the mountains,
the hairs the herbs and trees. As the sun rises, it is the
forepart, as it sets, the hindpart of the horse.
When the horse shakes itself, then it lightens; when it
kicks, it thunders; when it makes water, it rains;
voice is its voice.
1-1:2. Verily Day arose after the horse as the (golden)
vessel, called Mahiman (greatness), which (at the
sacrifice) is placed before the horse. Its place is in the
Eastern sea. The Night arose after the horse as the
(silver) vessel, called Mahiman, which (at the sacrifice) is
placed behind the horse. Its place is in the
Western sea. Verily, these two vessels (or greatnesses)
arose to be on each side of the horse. 
As a racer he carried the Devas, as a stallion the
Gandharvas, as a runner the Asuras, as a horse men.
The sea is its kin, the sea is its birthplace.
Section 2
Second Brahmana
1-2:1. In the beginning there was nothing (to be
perceived) here whatsoever. By Death indeed all this
was concealed, by hunger; for death is hunger. Death
(the first being) thought, `Let me have a body.'
Then he moved about, worshipping. From him thus
worshipping water was produced. And he said:
`Verily, there appeared to me, while I worshipped
(arkate), water (ka).' This is why water is called ar-ka.
Surely there is water (or pleasure) for him who thus
knows the reason why water is called arka.
1-2:2. Verily water is arka. And what was there as the
froth of the water, that was hardened, and became
the earth. On that earth he (Death) rested, and from him,
thus resting and heated, Agni (Virag)
proceeded, full of light.
1-2:3. That being divided itself threefold, Aditya (the sun)
as the third, and Vayu (the air) as the third.
That spirit (prana) became threefold. The head was the
Eastern quarter, and the arms this and that
quarter (i.e. the N.E. and S.E., on the left and right sides).
Then the tail was the Western quarter, and the
two legs this and that quarter (i.e. the N.W. and S.W.).
The sides were the Southern and Northern
quarters, the back heaven, the belly the sky, the dust the
earth. Thus he (Mrityu, as arka) stands firm in
the water, and he who knows this stands firm wherever
he goes.
1-2:4. He desired, `Let a second body be born of me,'
and he (Death or Hunger) embraced Speech in his
mind. Then the seed became the year. Before that time
there was no year. Speech bore him so long as a
year, and after that time sent him forth. Then when he
was born, he (Death) opened his mouth, as if to
swallow him. He cried Bhan! and that became speech. 
1-2:5. He thought, `If I kill him, I shall have but little food.'
He therefore brought forth by that speech
and by that body (the year) all whatsoever exists, the Rik,
the Yagus, the Saman, the metres, the sacrifices,
men, and animals.
And whatever he (Death) brought forth, that he resolved
to eat (ad). Verily because he eats everything,
therefore is Aditi (Death) called Aditi. He who thus knows
why Aditi is called Aditi, becomes an eater of
everything, and everything becomes his food.
1-2:6. He desired to sacrifice again with a greater
sacrifice. He toiled and performed penance. And while
he toiled and performed penance, glorious power went
out of him. Verily glorious power means the
senses (prana). Then when the senses had gone out, the
body took to swelling (sva-yitum), and mind was
in the body.
1-2:7. He desired that this body should be fit for sacrifice
(medhya), and that he should be embodied by it.
Then he became a horse (asva), because it swelled
(asvat), and was fit for sacrifice (medhya); and this is
why the horse-sacrifice is called Asva-medha.
Verily he who knows him thus, knows the Asvamedha.
Then, letting the horse free, he thought, and at
the end of a year he offered it up for himself, while he
gave up the (other) animals to the deities.
Therefore the sacrificers offered up the purified horse
belonging to Pragapati, (as dedicated) to all the
deities.
Verily the shining sun is the Asvamedha-sacrifice, and his
body is the year; Agni is the sacrificial fire
(arka), and these worlds are his bodies. These two are
the sacrificial fire and the Asvamedha-sacrifice,
and they are again one deity, viz. Death. He (who knows
this) overcomes another death, death does not
reach him, death is his Self, he becomes one of those
deities.
Section 3 
Third Brahmana
1-3:1. There were two kinds of descendants of Pragapati,
the Devas and the Asuras. Now the Devas were
indeed the younger, the Asuras the elder ones. The
Devas, who were struggling in these worlds, said:
`Well, let us overcome the Asuras at the sacrifices (the
Gyotishtoma) by means of the udgitha.'
1-3:2. They said to speech (Vak): `Do thou sing out for
us (the udgitha).' `Yes,' said speech, and sang (the
udgitha). Whatever delight there is in speech, that she
obtained for the Devas by singing (the three
pavamanas); but that she pronounced well (in the other
nine pavamanas), that was for herself. The
Asuras knew: `Verily, through this singer they will
overcome us.' They therefore rushed at the singer and
pierced her with evil. That evil which consists in saying
what is bad, that is that evil.
1-3:3. Then they (the Devas) said to breath (scent): `Do
thou sing out for us.' `Yes,' said breath, and
sang. Whatever delight there is in breath (smell), that he
obtained for the Devas by singing; but that he
smelled well, that was for himself. The Asuras knew:
`Verily, through this singer they will overcome us.'
They therefore rushed at the singer, and pierced him with
evil. That evil which consists in smelling what
is bad, that is that evil.
1-3:4. Then they said to the eye: `Do thou sing out for
us.' `Yes,' said the eye, and sang. Whatever
delight there is in the eye, that he obtained for the Devas
by singing; but that he saw well, that was for
himself. The Asuras knew: `Verily, through this singer
they will overcome us.' They therefore rushed at
the singer, and pierced him with evil. That evil which
consists in seeing what is bad, that is that evil.
1-3:5. Then they said to the ear: `Do thou sing out for us.'
`Yes,' said the ear, and sang. Whatever
delight there is in the ear, that he obtained for the Devas
by singing; but that he heard well, that was for
himself. The Asuras knew: `Verily, through this singer
they will overcome us.' They therefore rushed at 
the singer, and pierced him with evil. That evil which
consists in hearing what is bad, that is that evil.
1-3:6. Then they said to the mind: `Do thou sing out for
us.' `Yes,' said the mind, and sang. Whatever
delight there is in the mind, that he obtained for the Devas
by singing; but that he thought well, that was
for himself. The Asuras knew: `Verily, through this singer
they will overcome us.' They therefore rushed
at the singer, and pierced him with evil. That evil which
consists in thinking what is bad, that is that evil.
Thus they overwhelmed these deities with evils, thus they
pierced them with evil.
1-3:7. Then they said to the breath in the mouth: `Do
thou sing for us.' `Yes,' said the breath, and sang.
The Asuras knew: `Verily, through this singer they will
overcome us.' They therefore rushed at him and
pierced him with evil. Now as a ball of earth will be
scattered when hitting a stone, thus they perished,
scattered in all directions. Hence the Devas rose, the
Asuras fell. He who knows this, rises by his self,
and the enemy who hates him falls.
1-3:8. Then they (the Devas) said: `Where was he then
who thus stuck to us?' It was (the breath) within
the mouth (asye 'ntar), and therefore called Ayasya; he
was the sap (rasa) of the limbs (anga), and
therefore called Angirasa.
1-3:9. That deity was called Dur, because Death was far
(duran) from it. From him who knows this,
Death is far off.
1-3:10. That deity, after having taken away the evil of
those deities, viz. death, sent it to where the end of
the quarters of the earth is. There he deposited their
sins. Therefore let no one go to a man, let no one go
to the end (of the quarters of the earth), that he may not
meet there with evil, with death.
1-3:11. That deity, after having taken away the evil of
those deities, viz. death, carried them beyond
death. 
1-3:12. He carried speech across first. When speech
had become freed from death, it became (what it had
been before) Agni (fire). That Agni, after having stepped
beyond death, shines.
1-3:13. Then he carried breath (scent) across. When
breath had become freed from death, it became
Vayu (air). That Vayu, after having stepped beyond
death, blows.
1-3:14. Then he carried the eye across. When the eye
had become freed from death, it became Aditya
(the sun). That Aditya, after having stepped beyond
death, burns.
1-3:15. Then he carried the ear across. When the ear
had become freed from death, it became the
quarters (space). These are our quarters (space), which
have stepped beyond death.
1-3:16. Then he carried the mind across. When the mind
had become freed from death, it became the
moon (Kandramas). That moon, after having stepped
beyond death, shines. Thus does that deity carry
him, who knows this, across death.
1-3:17. Then breath (vital), by singing, obtained for
himself eatable food. For whatever food is eaten, is
eaten by breath alone, and in it breath rests.
The Devas said: `Verily, thus far, whatever food there is,
thou hast by singing acquired it for thyself. Now
therefore give us a share in that food.' He said: `You
there, enter into me.' They said Yes, and entered all
into him. Therefore whatever food is eaten by breath, by
it the other senses are satisfied.
1-3:18. If a man knows this, then his own relations come
to him in the same manner; he becomes their
supporter, their chief leader, their strong ruler. And if ever
any one tries to oppose one who is possessed
of such knowledge among his own relatives, then he will
not be able to support his own belongings. But
he who follows the man who is possessed of such
knowledge, and who with his permission wishes to 
support those whom he has to support, he indeed will be
able to support his own belongings.
1-3:19. He was called Ayasya Angirasa, for he is the sap
(rasa) of the limbs (anga). Verily, breath is the
sap of the limbs. Yes, breath is the sap of the limbs.
Therefore from whatever limb breath goes away,
that limb withers, for breath verily is the sap of the limbs.
1-3:20. He (breath) is also Brihaspati, for speech is
Brihati (Rig-veda), and he is her lord; therefore he is
Brihaspati.
1-3:21. He (breath) is also Brahmanaspati, for speech is
Brahman (Yagur-veda), and he is her lord;
therefore he is Brahmanaspati.
He (breath) is also Saman (the Udgitha), for speech is
Saman (Sama-veda), and that is both speech (sa)
and breath (ama). This is why Saman is called Saman.
1-3:22. Or because he is equal (sama) to a grub, equal
to a gnat, equal to an elephant, equal to these three
worlds, nay, equal to this universe, therefore he is
Saman. He who thus knows this Saman, obtains union
and oneness with Saman.
1-3:23. He (breath) is Udgitha. Breath verily is Ut, for by
breath this universe is upheld (uttabdha); and
speech is Githa, song. And because he is ut and githa,
therefore he (breath) is Udgitha.
1-3:24. And thus Brahmadatta Kaikitaneya (the grandson
of Kikitana), while taking Soma (ragan), said:
`May this Soma strike my head off, if Ayasya Angirasa
sang another Udgitha than this. He sang it indeed
as speech and breath.'
1-3:25. He who knows what is the property of this
Saman, obtains property. Now verily its property is
tone only. Therefore let a priest, who is going to perform
the sacrificial work of a Sama-singer, desire
that his voice may have a good tone, and let him perform
the sacrifice with a voice that is in good tone.
Therefore people (who want a priest) for a sacrifice, look
out for one who possesses a good voice, as for 
one who possesses property. He who thus knows what is
the property of that Saman, obtains property.
1-3:26. He who knows what is the gold of that Saman,
obtains gold. Now verily its gold is tone only. He
who thus knows what is the gold of that Saman, obtains
gold.
1-3:27. He who knows what is the support of that Saman,
he is supported. Now verily its support is
speech only. For, as supported in speech, that breath is
sung as that Saman. Some say the support is in
food.
Next follows the Abhyaroha (the ascension) of the
Pavamana verses. Verily the Prastotri begins to sing the
Saman, and when he begins, then let him (the sacrificer)
recite these (three Yagus-verses):
`Lead me from the unreal to the real! Lead me from
darkness to light! Lead me from death to
immortality!'
Now when he says, `Lead me from the unreal to the real,'
the unreal is verily death, the real immortality.
He therefore says, `Lead me from death to immortality,
make me immortal.'
When he says, `Lead me from darkness to light,'
darkness is verily death, light immortality. He therefore
says, `Lead me from death to immortality, make me
immortal.'
When he says, `Lead me from death to immortality,' there
is nothing there, as it were, hidden (obscure,
requiring explanation).
1-3:28. Next come the other Stotras with which the priest
may obtain food for himself by singing them.
Therefore let the sacrificer, while these Stotras are being
sung, ask for a boon, whatever desire he may
desire. An Udgatri priest who knows this obtains by his
singing whatever desire he may desire either for
himself or for the sacrificer. This (knowledge) indeed is
called the conqueror of the worlds. He who thus 
knows this Saman, for him there is no fear of his not
being admitted to the worlds.
Section 4
Fourth Brahmana
1-4:1. In the beginning this was Self alone, in the shape
of a person (purusha). He looking round saw
nothing but his Self. He first said, `This is I;' therefore he
became I by name. Therefore even now, if a
man is asked, he first says, `This is I,' and then
pronounces the other name which he may have. And
because before (purva) all this, he (the Self) burnt down
(ush) all evils, therefore he was a person (purusha). Verily he who knows this, burns down every one
who tries to be before him.
1-4:2. He feared, and therefore any one who is lonely
fears. He thought, `As there is nothing but myself,
why should I fear?' Thence his fear passed away. For
what should he have feared? Verily fear arises
from a second only.
1-4:3. But he felt no delight. Therefore a man who is
lonely feels no delight. He wished for a second.
He was so large as man and wife together. He then
made this his Self to fall in two (pat), and thence
arose husband (pati) and wife (patni). Therefore
Yagnavalkya said: `We two are thus (each of us) like
half a shell.' Therefore the void which was there, is filled
by the wife. He embraced her, and men were
born.
1-4:4. She thought, `How can he embrace me, after
having produced me from himself? I shall hide
myself.'
She then became a cow, the other became a bull and
embraced her, and hence cows were born. The one
became a mare, the other a stallion; the one a male ass,
the other a female ass. He embraced her, and
hence one-hoofed animals were born. The one became
a she-goat, the other a he-goat; the one became a
ewe, the other a ram. He embraced her, and hence
goats and sheep were born. And thus he created 
everything that exists in pairs, down to the ants.creation,
sacred cow
1-4:5. He knew, `I indeed am this creation, for I created
all this.' Hence he became the creation, and he
who knows this lives in this his creation.
1-4:6. Next he thus produced fire by rubbing. From the
mouth, as from the fire-hole, and from the hands
he created fire. Therefore both the mouth and the hands
are inside without hair, for the fire-hole is inside
without hair.
And when they say, `Sacrifice to this or sacrifice to that
god,' each god is but his manifestation, for he is
all gods.
Now, whatever there is moist, that he created from seed;
this is Soma. So far verily is this universe either
food or eater. Soma indeed is food, Agni eater. This is
the highest creation of Brahman, when he created
the gods from his better part, and when he, who was
(then) mortal, created the immortals. Therefore it
was the highest creation. And he who knows this, lives in
this his highest creation.
1-4:7. Now all this was then undeveloped. It became
developed by form and name, so that one could say,
`He, called so and so, is such a one.' Therefore at present
also all this is developed by name and form, so
that one can say, `He, called so and so, is such a one.'
He (Brahman or the Self) entered thither, to the very tips
of the finger-nails, as a razor might be fitted in a
razor-case, or as fire in a fire-place.
He cannot be seen, for, in part only, when breathing, he is
breath by name; when speaking, speech by
name; when seeing, eye by name; when hearing, ear by
name; when thinking, mind by name. All these
are but the names of his acts. And he who worships
(regards) him as the one or the other, does not know
him, for he is apart from this (when qualified) by the one
or the other (predicate). Let men worship him
as Self, for in the Self all these are one. This Self is the
footstep of everything, for through it one knows 
everything. And as one can find again by footsteps what
was lost, thus he who knows this finds glory and
praise.
1-4:8. This, which is nearer to us than anything, this Self,
is dearer than a son, dearer than wealth, dearer
than all else.
And if one were to say to one who declares another than
the Self dear, that he will lose what is dear to
him, very likely it would be so. Let him worship the Self
alone as dear. He who worships the Self alone
as dear, the object of his love will never perish.
1-4:9. Here they say: `If men think that by knowledge of
Brahman they will become everything, what
then did that Brahman know, from whence all this
sprang?'
1-4:10. Verily in the beginning this was Brahman, that
Brahman knew (its) Self only, saying, `I am
Brahman.' From it all this sprang. Thus, whatever Deva
was awakened (so as to know Brahman), he
indeed became that (Brahman); and the same with Rishis
and men. The Rishi Vamadeva saw and
understood it, singing, `I was Manu (moon), I was the
sun.' Therefore now also he who thus knows that
he is Brahman, becomes all this, and even the Devas
cannot prevent it, for he himself is their Self.
Now if a man worships another deity, thinking the deity is
one and he another, he does not know. He is
like a beast for the Devas. For verily, as many beasts
nourish a man, thus does every man nourish the
Devas. If only one beast is taken away, it is not pleasant;
how much more when many are taken!
Therefore it is not pleasant to the Devas that men should
know this.
1-4:11. Verily in the beginning this was Brahman, one
only. That being one, was not strong enough. It
created still further the most excellent Kshatra (power),
viz. those Kshatras (powers) among the Devas,
Indra, Varuna, Soma, Rudra, Parganya, Yama, Mrityu,
Isana. Therefore there is nothing beyond the 
Kshatra, and therefore at the Ragasuya sacrifice the
Brahman sits down below the Kshatriya. He confers
that glory on the Kshatra alone. But Brahman is
(nevertheless) the birth-place of the Kshatra. Therefore
though a king is exalted, he sits down at the end (of the
sacrifice) below the Brahman, as his birth-place.
He who injures him, injures his own birth-place. He
becomes worse, because he has injured one better
than himself.
1-4:12. He was not strong enough. He created the Vis
(people), the classes of Devas which in their
different orders are called Vasus, Rudras, Adityas, Visve
Devas, Maruts.
1-4:13. He was not strong enough. He created the
Sudra colour (caste), as Pushan (as nourisher). This
earth verily is Pushan (the nourisher); for the earth
nourishes all this whatsoever.
1-4:14. He was not strong enough. He created still
further the most excellent Law (dharma). Law is the
Kshatra (power) of the Kshatra, therefore there is nothing
higher than the Law. Thenceforth even a weak
man rules a stronger with the help of the Law, as with the
help of a king. Thus the Law is what is called
the true. And if a man declares what is true, they say he
declares the Law; and if he declares the Law,
they say he declares what is true. Thus both are the
same.
1-4:15. There are then this Brahman, Kshatra, Vis, and
Sudra. Among the Devas that Brahman existed
as Agni (fire) only, among men as Brahmana, as
Kshatriya through the (divine) Kshatriya, as Vaisya
through the (divine) Vaisya, as Sudra through the (divine)
Sudra. Therefore people wish for their future
state among the Devas through Agni (the sacrificial fire)
only; and among men through the Brahmana, for
in these two forms did Brahman exist.
Now if a man departs this life without having seen his true
future life (in the Self), then that Self, not
being known, does not receive and bless him, as if the
Veda had not been read, or as if a good work had 
not been done. Nay, even if one who does not know that
(Self), should perform here on earth some great
holy work, it will perish for him in the end. Let a man
worship the Self only as his true state. If a man
worships the Self only as his true state, his work does not
perish, for whatever he desires that he gets from
that Self.
1-4:16. Now verily this Self (of the ignorant man) is the
world of all creatures. In so far as man sacrifices
and pours out libations, he is the world of the Devas; in so
far as he repeats the hymns, &c., he is the
world of the Rishis; in so far as he offers cakes to the
Fathers and tries to obtain offspring, he is the world
of the Fathers; in so far as he gives shelter and food to
men, he is the world of men; in so far as he finds
fodder and water for the animals, he is the world of the
animals; in so far as quadrupeds, birds, and even
ants live in his houses, he is their world. And as every
one wishes his own world not to be injured, thus
all beings wish that he who knows this should not be
injured. Verily this is known and has been well
reasoned.
1-4:17. In the beginning this was Self alone, one only.
He desired, `Let there be a wife for me that I may
have offspring, and let there be wealth for me that I may
offer sacrifices.' Verily this is the whole desire,
and, even if wishing for more, he would not find it.
Therefore now also a lonely person desires, `Let there
be a wife for me that I may have offspring, and let there
be wealth for me that I may offer sacrifices.' And
so long as he does not obtain either of these things, he
thinks he is incomplete. Now his completeness (is
made up as follows): mind is his self (husband); speech
the wife; breath the child; the eye all worldly
wealth, for he finds it with the eye; the ear his divine
wealth, for he hears it with the ear. The body
(atman) is his work, for with the body he works. This is
the fivefold sacrifice, for fivefold is the animal,
fivefold man, fivefold all this whatsoever. He who knows
this, obtains all this.
Section 5
Fifth Brahmana 
1-5:1. `When the father (of creation) had produced by
knowledge and penance (work) the seven kinds of
food, one of his (foods) was common to all beings, two he
assigned to the Devas, (1)
`Three he made for himself, one he gave to the animals.
In it all rests, whatsoever breathes and breathes
not. (2)
`Why then do these not perish, though they are always
eaten? He who knows this imperishable one, he
eats food with his face. (3)
He goes even to the Devas, he lives on strength.' (4)
1-5:2. When it is said, that `the father produced by
knowledge and penance the seven kinds of food,' it is
clear that (it was he who) did so. When it is said, that
`one of his (foods) was common,' then that is that
common food of his which is eaten. He who worships
(eats) that (common food), is not removed from
evil, for verily that food is mixed (property). When it is
said, that `two he assigned to the Devas,' that is
the huta, which is sacrificed in fire, and the prahuta, which
is given away at a sacrifice. But they also say,
the new-moon and full-moon sacrifices are here intended,
and therefore one should not offer them as an
ishti or with a wish.
When it is said, that `one he gave to animals,' that is milk.
For in the beginning (in their infancy) both
men and animals live on milk. And therefore they either
make a new-born child lick ghrita (butter), or
they make it take the breast. And they call a new-born
creature `atrinada,' i.e. not eating herbs. When it
is said, that `in it all rests, whatsoever breathes and
breathes not,' we see that all this, whatsoever breathes
and breathes not, rests and depends on milk.
And when it is said (in another Brahmana), that a man
who sacrifices with milk a whole year, overcomes
death again, let him not think so. No, on the very day on
which he sacrifices, on that day he overcomes
death again; for he who knows this, offers to the gods the
entire food (viz. milk). 
When it is said, `Why do these not perish, though they
are always eaten,' we answer, Verily, the Person is
the imperishable, and he produces that food again and
again.
When it is said, `He who knows this imperishable one,'
then, verily, the Person is the imperishable one,
for he produces this food by repeated thought, and
whatever he does not work by his works, that perishes.
When it is said, that `he eats food with his face,' then face
means the mouth, he eats it with his mouth.
When it is said, that `he goes even to the Devas, he lives
on strength,' that is meant as praise.
1-5:3. When it is said, that `he made three for himself,'
that means that he made mind, speech, and breath
for himself. As people say, `My mind was elsewhere, I
did not see; my mind was elsewhere, I did not
hear,' it is clear that a man sees with his mind and hears
with his mind. Desire, representation, doubt,
faith, want of faith, memory, forgetfulness, shame,
reflexion, fear, all this is mind. Therefore even if a
man is touched on the back, he knows it through the
mind.
Whatever sound there is, that is speech. Speech indeed
is intended for an end or object, it is nothing by
itself.
The up-breathing, the down-breathing, the backbreathing, the out-breathing, the on-breathing, all that is
breathing is breath (prana) only. Verily that Self consists
of it; that Self consists of speech, mind, and
breath.
1-5:4. These are the three worlds: earth is speech, sky
mind, heaven breath.
1-5:5. These are the three Vedas: the Rig-veda is
speech, the Yagur-veda mind, the Sama-veda breath.
1-5:6. These are the Devas, Fathers, and men: the
Devas are speech, the Fathers mind, men breath. 
1-5:7. These are father, mother, and child: the father is
mind, the mother speech, the child breath.
1-5:8. These are what is known, what is to be known,
and what is unknown.
What is known, has the form of speech, for speech is
known. Speech, having become this, protects man.
1-5:9. What is to be known, has the form of mind, for
mind is what is to be known. Mind, having
become this, protects man.
1-5:10. What is unknown, has the form of breath, for
breath is unknown. Breath, having become this,
protects man.
1-5:11. Of that speech (which is the food of Pragapati)
earth is the body, light the form, viz. this fire.
And so far as speech extends, so far extends the earth,
so far extends fire.
1-5:12. Next, of this mind heaven is the body, light the
form, viz. this sun. And so far as this mind
extends, so far extends heaven, so far extends the sun.
If they (fire and sun) embrace each other, then
wind is born, and that is Indra, and he is without a rival.
Verily a second is a rival, and he who knows
this, has no rival.
1-5:13. Next, of this breath water is the body, light the
form, viz. this moon. And so far as this breath
extends, so far extends water, so far extends the moon.
These are all alike, all endless. And he who worships
them as finite, obtains a finite world, but he who
worships them as infinite, obtains an infinite world.
1-5:14. That Pragapati is the year, and he consists of
sixteen digits. The nights indeed are his fifteen
digits, the fixed point his sixteenth digit. He is increased
and decreased by the nights. Having on the
new-moon night entered with the sixteenth part into
everything that has life, he is thence born again in 
the morning. Therefore let no one cut off the life of any
living thing on that night, not even of a lizard, in
honour (pugartham) of that deity.
1-5:15. Now verily that Pragapati, consisting of sixteen
digits, who is the year, is the same as a man who
knows this. His wealth constitutes the fifteen digits, his
Self the sixteenth digit. He is increased and
decreased by that wealth. His Self is the nave, his wealth
the felly. Therefore even if he loses everything,
if he lives but with his Self, people say, he lost the felly
(which can be restored again).
1-5:16. Next there are verily three worlds, the world of
men, the world of the Fathers, the world of the
Devas. The world of men can be gained by a son only,
not by any other work. By sacrifice the world of
the Fathers, by knowledge the world of the Devas is
gained. The world of the Devas is the best of worlds,
therefore they praise knowledge.
1-5:17. Next follows the handing over. When a man
thinks he is going to depart, he says to his son:
`Thou art Brahman (the Veda, so far as acquired by the
father); thou art the sacrifice (so far as performed
by the father); thou art the world.' The son answers: `I am
Brahman, I am the sacrifice, I am the world.'
Whatever has been learnt (by the father) that, taken as
one, is Brahman. Whatever sacrifices there are,
they, taken as one, are the sacrifice. Whatever worlds
there are, they, taken as one, are the world. Verily
here ends this (what has to be done by a father, viz.
study, sacrifice, &c.) `He (the son), being all this,
preserved me from this world,' thus he thinks. Therefore
they call a son who is instructed (to do all this),
a world-son (lokya), and therefore they instruct him.
When a father who knows this, departs this world, then he
enters into his son together with his own spirits
(with speech, mind, and breath). If there is anything done
amiss by the father, of all that the son delivers
him, and therefore he is called Putra, son. By help of his
son the father stands firm in this world. Then
these divine immortal spirits (speech, mind, and breath)
enter into him.spirits, possession 
1-5:18. From the earth and from fire, divine speech
enters into him. And verily that is divine speech
whereby, whatever he says, comes to be.
1-5:19. From heaven and the sun, divine mind enters into
him. And verily that is divine mind whereby
he becomes joyful, and grieves no more.
1-5:20. From water and the moon, divine breath (spirit)
enters into him. And verily that is divine breath
which, whether moving or not moving, does not tire, and
therefore does not perish. He who knows this,
becomes the Self of all beings. As that deity
(Hiranyagarbha) is, so does he become. And as all
beings
honour that deity (with sacrifice, &c.), so do all beings
honour him who knows this.
Whatever grief these creatures suffer, that is all one (and
therefore disappears). Only what is good
approaches him; verily, evil does not approach the
Devas.
1-5:21. Next follows the consideration of the
observances (acts). Pragapati created the actions (active
senses). When they had been created, they strove
among themselves. Voice held, I shall speak; the eye
held, I shall see; the ear held, I shall hear; and thus the
other actions too, each according to its own act.
Death, having become weariness, took them and seized
them. Having seized them, death held them back
(from their work). Therefore speech grows weary, the eye
grows weary, the ear grows weary. But death
did not seize the central breath. Then the others tried to
know him, and said: `Verily, he is the best of us,
he who, whether moving or not, does not tire and does
not perish. Well, let all of us assume his form.'
Thereupon they all assumed his form, and therefore they
are called after him `breaths' (spirits).
In whatever family there is a man who knows this, they
call that family after his name. And he who
strives with one who knows this, withers away and finally
dies. So far with regard to the body.
1-5:22. Now with regard to the deities. 
Agni (fire) held, I shall burn; Aditya (the sun) held, I shall
warm; Kandramas (the moon) held, I shall
shine; and thus also the other deities, each according to
the deity. And as it was with the central breath
among the breaths, so it was with Vayu, the wind among
those deities. The other deities fade, not Vayu.
Vayu is the deity that never sets.
1-5:23. And here there is this Sloka:
`He from whom the sun rises, and into whom it sets' (he
verily rises from the breath, and sets in the
breath)
`Him the Devas made the law, he only is to-day, and he
to-morrow also' (whatever these Devas
determined then, that they perform to-day also).
Therefore let a man perform one observance only, let him
breathe up and let him breathe down, that the
evil death may not reach him. And when he performs it,
let him try to finish it. Then he obtains through
it union and oneness with that deity (with prana).
Section 6
Sixth Brahmana
1-6:1. Verily this is a triad, name, form, and work. Of
these names, that which is called Speech is the
Uktha (hymn, supposed to mean also origin), for from it all
names arise. It is their Saman (song,
supposed to mean also sameness), for it is the same as
all names. It is their Brahman (prayer, supposed to
mean also support), for it supports all names.
1-6:2. Next, of the forms, that which is called Eye is the
Uktha (hymn), for from it all forms arise. It is
their Saman (song), for it is the same as all forms. It is
their Brahman (prayer), for it supports all forms.
1-6:3. Next, of the works, that which is called Body is the
Uktha (hymn), for from it all works arise. It is
their Saman (song), for it is the same as all works. It is
their Brahman (prayer), for it supports all works. 
That being a triad is one, viz. this Self; and the Self, being
one, is that triad. This is the immortal,
covered by the true. Verily breath is the immortal, name
and form are the true, and by them the immortal
is covered.

~ Chapter 2 ~
Second Adhyaya
Section 1
First Brahmana
2-1:1. There was formerly the proud Gargya Balaki, a
man of great reading. He said to Agatasatru of
Kasi, `Shall I tell you Brahman?' Agatasatru said: `We
give a thousand (cows) for that speech (of yours),
for verily all people run away, saying, Ganaka (the king of
Mithila) is our father (patron).'
2-1:2. Gargya said: `The person that is in the sun, that I
adore as Brahman.' Agatasatru said to him: `No,
no! Do not speak to me on this. I adore him verily as the
supreme, the head of all beings, the king.
Whoso adores him thus, becomes supreme, the head of
all beings, a king.'
2-1:3. Gargya said: `The person that is in the moon (and
in the mind), that I adore as Brahman.'
Agatasatru said to him: `No, no! Do not speak to me on
this. I adore him verily as the great, clad in
white raiment, as Soma, the king.' Whoso adores him
thus, Soma is poured out and poured forth for him
day by day, and his food does not fail.
2-1:4. Gargya said: `The person that is in the lightning
(and in the heart), that I adore as Brahman.'
Agatasatru said to him: `No, no! Do not speak to me on
this. I adore him verily as the luminous.' Whoso
adores him thus, becomes luminous, and his offspring
becomes luminous. 
2-1:5. Gargya said: `The person that is in the ether (and
in the ether of the heart), that I adore as
Brahman.' Agatasatru said to him: `No, no! Do not speak
to me on this. I adore him as what is full, and
quiescent.' Whoso adores him thus, becomes filled with
offspring and cattle, and his offspring does not
cease from this world.
2-1:6. Gargya said: `The person that is in the wind (and
in the breath), that I adore as Brahman.'
Agatasatru said to him: `No, no! Do not speak to me on
this. I adore him as Indra Vaikuntha, as the
unconquerable army (of the Maruts).' Whoso adores him
thus, becomes victorious, unconquerable,
conquering his enemies.
2-1:7. Gargya said: `The person that is in the fire (and in
the heart), that I adore as Brahman.'
Agatasatru said to him: `No, no! Do not speak to me on
this. I adore him as powerful.' Whoso adores
him thus, becomes powerful, and his offspring becomes
powerful.
2-1:8. Gargya said: `The person that is in the water (in
seed, and in the heart), that I adore as Brahman.'
Agatasatru said to him: `No, no! Do not speak to me on
this. I adore him as likeness.' Whoso adores him
thus, to him comes what is likely (or proper), not what is
improper; what is born from him, is like unto
him.
2-1:9. Gargya said: `The person that is in the mirror, that
I adore as Brahman.' Agatasatru said to him:
`No, no! Do not speak to me on this. I adore him verily
as the brilliant.' Whoso adores him thus, he
becomes brilliant, his offspring becomes brilliant, and with
whomsoever he comes together, he outshines
them.
2-1:10. Gargya said: `The sound that follows a man while
he moves, that I adore as Brahman.'
Agatasatru said to him: `No, no! Do not speak to me on
this. I adore him verily as life.' Whoso adores
him thus, he reaches his full age in this world, breath
does not leave him before the time. 
2-1:11. Gargya said: `The person that is in space, that I
adore as Brahman.' Agatasatru said to him: `No,
no! Do not speak to me on this. I adore him verily as the
second who never leaves us.' Whoso adores
him thus, becomes possessed of a second, his party is
not cut off from him.
2-1:12. Gargya said: `The person that consists of the
shadow, that I adore as Brahman.' Agatasatru said
to him: `No, no! Do not speak to me on this. I adore him
verily as death.' Whoso adores him thus, he
reaches his whole age in this world, death does not
approach him before the time.
2-1:13. Gargya said: `The person that is in the body, that
I adore as Brahman.' Agatasatru said to him:
`No, no! Do not speak to me on this. I adore him verily
as embodied.' Whoso adores him thus, becomes
embodied, and his offspring becomes embodied.
Then Gargya became silent.
2-1:14. Agatasatru said: `Thus far only?' `Thus far only,'
he replied. Agatasatru said: `This does not
suffice to know it (the true Brahman).' Gargya replied:
`Then let me come to you, as a pupil.'
2-1:15. Agatasatru said: `Verily, it is unnatural that a
Brahmana should come to a Kshatriya, hoping that
he should tell him the Brahman. However, I shall make
you know him clearly,' thus saying he took him
by the hand and rose.
And the two together came to a person who was asleep.
He called him by these names, `Thou, great one,
clad in white raiment, Soma, King.' He did not rise. Then
rubbing him with his hand, he woke him, and
he arose.
2-1:16. Agatasatru said: `When this man was thus
asleep, where was then the person (purusha), the
intelligent? and from whence did he thus come back?'
Gargya did not know this?
2-1:17. Agatasatru said: `When this man was thus
asleep, then the intelligent person (purusha), having 
through the intelligence of the senses (pranas) absorbed
within himself all intelligence, lies in the ether,
which is in the heart. When he takes in these different
kinds of intelligence, then it is said that the man
sleeps (svapiti). Then the breath is kept in, speech is
kept in, the ear is kept in, the eye is kept in, the
mind is kept in.
2-1:18. But when he moves about in sleep (and dream),
then these are his worlds. He is, as it were, a
great king; he is, as it were, a great Brahmana; he rises,
as it were, and he falls. And as a great king
might keep in his own subjects, and move about,
according to his pleasure, within his own domain, thus
does that person (who is endowed with intelligence) keep
in the various senses (pranas) and move about,
according to his pleasure, within his own body (while
dreaming).
2-1:19. Next, when he is in profound sleep, and knows
nothing, there are the seventy-two thousand
arteries called Hita, which from the heart spread through
the body. Through them he moves forth and
rests in the surrounding body. And as a young man, or a
great king, or a great Brahmana, having reached
the summit of happiness, might rest, so does he then
rest.
2-1:20. As the spider comes out with its thread, or as
small sparks come forth from fire, thus do all
senses, all worlds, all Devas, all beings come forth from
that Self. The Upanishad (the true name and
doctrine) of that Self is `the True of the True.' Verily the
senses are the true, and he is the true of the true.
Section 2
Second Brahmana
2-2:1. Verily he who knows the babe with his place, his
chamber, his post, and his rope, he keeps off the
seven relatives who hate him. Verily by the young is
meant the inner life, by his place this (body), by his
chamber this (head), by his post the vital breath, by his
rope the food. 
2-2:2. Then the seven imperishable ones approach him.
There are the red lines in the eye, and by them
Rudra clings to him. There is the water in the eye, and by
it Parganya clings to him. There is the pupil,
and by it Aditya (sun) clings to him. There is the dark iris,
and by it Agni clings to him. There is the
white eye-ball, and by it Indra clings to him. With the
lower eye-lash the earth, with the upper eye-lash
the heaven clings to him. He who knows this, his food
does never perish.
2-2:3. On this there is this Sloka:
`There is a cup having its mouth below and its bottom
above. Manifold glory has been placed into it. On
its lip sit the seven Rishis, the tongue as the eighth
communicates with Brahman.' What is called the cup
having its mouth below and its bottom above is this head,
for its mouth (the mouth) is below, its bottom
(the skull) is above. When it is said that manifold glory
has been placed into it, the senses verily are
manifold glory, and he therefore means the senses.
When he says that the seven Rishis sit on its lip, the
Rishis are verily the (active) senses, and he means the
senses. And when he says that the tongue as the
eighth communicates with Brahman, it is because the
tongue, as the eighth, does communicate with
Brahman.
2-2:4. These two (the two ears) are the Rishis Gautama
and Bharadvaga; the right Gautama, the left
Bharadvaga. These two (the eyes) are the Rishis
Visvamitra and Gamadagni; the right Visvamitra, the
left Gamadagni. These two (the nostrils) are the Rishis
Vasishtha and Kasyapa; the right Vasishtha, the
left Kasyapa. The tongue is Atri, for with the tongue food
is eaten, and Atri is meant for Atti, eating. He
who knows this, becomes an eater of everything, and
everything becomes his food.
Section 3
Third Brahmana
2-3:1. There are two forms of Brahman, the material and
the immaterial, the mortal and the immortal, 
the solid and the fluid, sat (being) and tya (that), (i.e. sattya, true).
2-3:2. Everything except air and sky is material, is mortal,
is solid, is definite. The essence of that which
is material, which is mortal, which is solid, which is
definite is the sun that shines, for he is the essence of
sat (the definite).
2-3:3. But air and sky are immaterial, are immortal, are
fluid, are indefinite. The essence of that which is
immaterial, which is immortal, which is fluid, which is
indefinite is the person in the disk of the sun, for
he is the essence of tyad (the indefinite). So far with
regard to the Devas.
2-3:4. Now with regard to the body. Everything except
the breath and the ether within the body is
material, is mortal, is solid, is definite. The essence of
that which is material, which is mortal, which is
solid, which is definite is the Eye, for it is the essence of
sat (the definite).
2-3:5. But breath and the ether within the body are
immaterial, are immortal, are fluid, are indefinite.
The essence of that which is immaterial, which is
immortal, which is fluid, which is indefinite is the
person in the right eye, for he is the essence of tyad (the
indefinite).
2-3:6. And what is the appearance of that person? Like
a saffron-coloured raiment, like white wool, like
cochineal, like the flame of fire, like the white lotus, like
sudden lightning. He who knows this, his glory
is like unto sudden lightning.
Next follows the teaching (of Brahman) by No, no! for
there is nothing else higher than this (if one says):
`It is not so.' Then comes the name `the True of the
True,' the senses being the True, and he (the
Brahman) the True of them.
Section 4
Fourth Brahmana 
2-4:1. Now when Yagnavalkya was going to enter upon
another state, he said: `Maitreyi, verily I am
going away from this my house (into the forest).
Forsooth, let me make a settlement between thee and
that Katyayani (my other wife).'
2-4:2. Maitreyi said: `My Lord, if this whole earth, full of
wealth, belonged to me, tell me, should I be
immortal by it?'
`No,' replied Yagnavalkya; `like the life of rich people will
be thy life. But there is no hope of immortality
by wealth.'
2-4:3. And Maitreyi said: `What should I do with that by
which I do not become immortal? What my
Lord knoweth (of immortality), tell that to me'.
2-4:4. Yagnavalkya replied: `Thou who art truly dear to
me, thou speakest dear words. Come, sit down, I
will explain it to thee, and mark well what I say.'
2-4:5. And he said: `Verily, a husband is not dear, that
you may love the husband; but that you may love
the Self, therefore a husband is dear.
`Verily, a wife is not dear, that you may love the wife; but
that you may love the Self, therefore a wife is
dear.
`Verily, sons are not dear, that you may love the sons; but
that you may love the Self, therefore sons are
dear.
`Verily, wealth is not dear, that you may love wealth; but
that you may love the Self, therefore wealth is
dear.
`Verily, the Brahman-class is not dear, that you may love
the Brahman-class; but that you may love the
Self, therefore the Brahman-class is dear.
`Verily, the Kshatra-class is not dear, that you may love
the Kshatra-class; but that you may love the Self,
therefore the Kshatra-class is dear. 
`Verily, the worlds are not dear, that you may love the
worlds; but that you may love the Self, therefore the
worlds are dear.
`Verily, the Devas are not dear, that you may love the
Devas; but that you may love the Self, therefore the
Devas are dear.
`Verily, creatures are not dear, that you may love the
creatures; but that you may love the Self, therefore
are creatures dear.
`Verily, everything is not dear that you may love
everything; but that you may love the Self, therefore
everything is dear.
`Verily, the Self is to be seen, to be heard, to be
perceived, to be marked, O Maitreyi! When we see, hear,
perceive, and know the Self, then all this is known.
2-4:6. `Whosoever looks for the Brahman-class
elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the
Brahman-class. Whosoever looks for the Kshatra-class
elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the
Kshatra-class. Whosoever looks for the worlds elsewhere
than in the Self, was abandoned by the worlds.
Whosoever looks for the Devas elsewhere than in the
Self, was abandoned by the Devas. Whosoever looks
for creatures elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned
by the creatures. Whosoever looks for anything
elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by everything.
This Brahman-class, this Kshatra-class, these
worlds, these Devas, these creatures, this everything, all
is that Self.
2-4:7. `Now as the sounds of a drum, when beaten,
cannot be seized externally (by themselves), but the
sound is seized, when the drum is seized or the beater of
the drum;
2-4:8. `And as the sounds of a conch-shell, when blown,
cannot be seized externally (by themselves), but
the sound is seized, when the shell is seized or the
blower of the shell;
2-4:9. `And as the sounds of a lute, when played, cannot
be seized externally (by themselves), but the
sound is seized, when the lute is seized or the player of
the lute;
2-4:10. `As clouds of smoke proceed by themselves out
of a lighted fire kindled with damp fuel, thus,
verily, O Maitreyi, has been breathed forth from this great
Being what we have as Rig-veda, Yagur-veda,
Sama-veda, Atharvangirasas, Itihasa (legends), Purana
(cosmogonies), Vidya (knowledge), the
Upanishads, Slokas (verses), Sutras (prose rules),
Anuvyakhyanas (glosses), Vyakhyanas (commentaries).
From him alone all these were breathed forth.
2-4:11. `As all waters find their centre in the sea, all
touches in the skin, all tastes in the tongue, all
smells in the nose, all colours in the eye, all sounds in the
ear, all percepts in the mind, all knowledge in
the heart, all actions in the hands, all movements in the
feet, and all the Vedas in speech,
2-4:12. `As a lump of salt, when thrown into water,
becomes dissolved into water, and could not be taken
out again, but wherever we taste (the water) it is salt,
thus verily, O Maitreyi, does this great Being,
endless, unlimited, consisting of nothing but knowledge,
rise from out these elements, and vanish again in
them. When he has departed, there is no more
knowledge (name), I say, O Maitreyi.'Thus spoke
Yagnavalkya.
2-4:13. Then Maitreyi said: `Here thou hast bewildered
me, Sir, when thou sayest that having departed,
there is no more knowledge.'
But Yagnavalkya replied: `O Maitreyi, I say nothing that is
bewildering. This is enough, O beloved, for
wisdom.
`For when there is as it were duality, then one sees the
other, one smells the other, one hears the other,
one salutes the other, one perceives the other, one
knows the other; but when the Self only is all this, how
should he smell another, how should he see another, how
should he hear another, how should he salute 
another, how should he perceive another, how should he
know another?_ How should he know Him by
whom he knows all this? How, O beloved should he
know (himself), the Knower?'

person, the Self (both are madhu). He indeed is

2-5:15. And verily this Self is the lord of all beings, the
king of all beings. And as all spokes are
contained in the axle and in the felly of a wheel, all
beings, and all those selfs (of the earth, water, &c.)
are contained in that Self.
2-5:16. Verily Dadhyak Atharvana proclaimed this honey
(the madhu-vidya) to the two Asvins, and a
Rishi, seeing this, said (Rv. I, 116, 12):
`O ye two heroes (Asvins), I make manifest that fearful
deed of yours (which you performed) for the sake
of gain, like as thunder makes manifest the rain. The
honey (madhu-vidya) which Dadhyak Atharvana
proclaimed to you through the head of a horse,'...
2-5:17. Verily Dadhyak Atharvana proclaimed this honey
to the two Asvins, and a Rishi, seeing this, said
(Rv. I, 117, 22):
`O Asvins, you fixed a horse's head on Atharvana
Dadhyak, and he, wishing to be true (to his promise),
proclaimed to you the honey, both that of Tvashtri and
that which is to be your secret, O ye strong ones.'
2-5:18. Verily Dadhyak Atharvana proclaimed this honey
to the two Asvins, and a Rishi, seeing this, 
said:
`He (the Lord) made bodies with two feet, he made
bodies with four feet. Having first become a bird, he
entered the bodies as purusha (as the person).' This very
purusha is in all bodies the purisaya, i.e. he who
lies in the body (and is therefore called purusha). There
is nothing that is not covered by him, nothing
that is not filled by him.
2-5:19. Verily Dadhyak Atharvana proclaimed this honey
to the two Asvins, and a Rishi, seeing this, said
(Rv. VI, 47, 18):
`He (the Lord) became like unto every form, and this is
meant to reveal the (true) form of him (the
Atman). Indra (the Lord) appears multiform through the
Mayas (appearances), for his horses (senses) are
yoked, hundreds and ten.'
This (Atman) is the horses, this (Atman) is the ten, and
the thousands, many and endless. This is the
Brahman, without cause and without effect, without
anything inside or outside; this Self is Brahman,
omnipresent and omniscient. This is the teaching (of the
Upanishads).

Adoration to Brahman.

~ Chapter 3 ~
Third Adhyaya
Section 1
First Brahmana
Adoration to the Highest Self (Paramatman)!
3-1:1. Ganaka Vaideha (the king of the Videhas)
sacrificed with a sacrifice at which many presents were
offered to the priests of (the Asvamedha). Brahmanas of
the Kurus and the Pankalas had come thither,
and Ganaka Vaideha wished to know, which of those
Brahmanas was the best read. So he enclosed a
thousand cows, and ten padas (of gold) were fastened to
each pair of horns.
3-1:2. And Ganaka spoke to them: `Ye venerable
Brahmanas, he who among you is the wisest, let him
drive away these cows.'
Then those Brahmanas durst not, but Yagnavalkya said
to his pupil: `Drive them away, my dear.'
He replied: `O glory of the Saman,' and drove them away. 
The Brahmanas became angry and said: `How could he
call himself the wisest among us?'
Now there was Asvala, the Hotri priest of Ganaka
Vaideha. He asked him: `Are you indeed the wisest
among us, O Yagnavalkya?' He replied: `I bow before the
wisest (the best knower of Brahman), but I wish
indeed to have these cows.'
Then Asvala, the Hotri priest, undertook to question him.
3-1:3. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `everything here
(connected with the sacrifice) is reached by death,
everything is overcome by death. By what means then is
the sacrificer freed beyond the reach of death?'
Yagnavalkya said: `By the Hotri priest, who is Agni (fire),
who is speech. For speech is the Hotri of the
sacrifice (or the sacrificer), and speech is Agni, and he is
the Hotri. This constitutes freedom, and perfect
freedom (from death).'
3-1:4. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `everything here is
reached by day and night, everything is overcome by
day and night. By what means then is the sacrificer freed
beyond the reach of day and night?'
Yagnavalkya said: `By the Adhvaryu priest, who is the
eye, who is Aditya (the sun). For the eye is the
Adhvaryu of the sacrifice, and the eye is the sun, and he
is the Adhvaryu. This constitutes freedom, and
perfect freedom.'
3-1:5. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `everything here is
reached by the waxing and waning of the moon,
everything is overcome by the waxing and waning of the
moon. By what means then is the sacrificer
freed beyond the reach of the waxing and waning of the
moon?'
Yagnavalkya said: `By the Udgatri priest, who is Vayu
(the wind), who is the breath. For the breath is the
Udgatri of the sacrifice, and the breath is the wind, and he
is the Udgatri. This constitutes freedom, and
perfect freedom.' 
3-1:6. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `this sky is, as it were,
without an ascent (staircase.) By what approach
does the sacrificer approach the Svarga world?'
Yagnavalkya said: `By the Brahman priest, who is the
mind (manas), who is the moon. For the mind is
the Brahman of the sacrifice, and the mind is the moon,
and he is the Brahman. This constitutes freedom,
and perfect freedom. These are the complete
deliverances (from death).'
Next follow the achievements.
3-1:7. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `how many Rik verses will
the Hotri priest employ to-day at this sacrifice?'
`Three,' replied Yagnavalkya.
`And what are these three?'
`Those which are called Puronuvakya, Yagya, and,
thirdly, Sasya.'
`What does he gain by them?'
`All whatsoever has breath.'
3-1:8. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `how many oblations
(ahuti) will the Adhvaryu priest employ to-day at this
sacrifice?'
`Three,' replied Yagnavalkya.
`And what are these three?'
`Those which, when offered, flame up; those which, when
offered, make an excessive noise; and those
which, when offered, sink down.'`What does he gain by
them?'
`By those which, when offered, flame up, he gains the
Deva (god) world, for the Deva world flames up, as
it were. By those which, when offered, make an
excessive noise, he gains the Pitri (father) world, for the 
Pitri world is excessively (noisy). By those which, when
offered, sink down, he gains the Manushya
(man) world, for the Manushya world is, as it were, down
below.'
3-1:9. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `with how many deities
does the Brahman priest on the right protect to-day
this sacrifice?'
`By one,' replied Yagnavalkya.
`And which is it?'
`The mind alone; for the mind is endless, and the
Visvedevas are endless, and he thereby gains the
endless
world.'
3-1:10. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `how many Stotriya
hymns will the Udgatri priest employ to-day at this
sacrifice?'
`Three,' replied Yagnavalkya.
`And what are these three?'
`Those which are called Puronuvakya, Yagya, and,
thirdly, Sasya.'
`And what are these with regard to the body
(adhyatmam)?'
`The Puronuvakya is Prana (up-breathing), the Yagya the
Apana (down-breathing), the Sasya the Vyana
(back-breathing).'
`What does he gain by them?'
`He gains the earth by the Puronuvakya, the sky by the
Yagya, heaven by the Sasya.'
After that Asvala held his peace.
Section 2
Second Brahmana 
3-2:1. Then Garatkarava Artabhaga asked.
`Yagnavalkya,' he said, `how many Grahas are there, and
how many Atigrahas?'
`Eight Grahas,' he replied, `and eight Atigrahas.'
`And what are these eight Grahas and eight Atigrahas?'
3-2:2. `Prana (breath) is one Graha, and that is seized by
Apana (down-breathing) as the Atigraha, for
one smells with the Apana.'
3-2:3. `Speech (vak) is one Graha, and that is seized by
name (naman) as the Atigraha, for with speech
one pronounces names.'
3-2:4. `The tongue is one Graha, and that is seized by
taste as the Atigraha, for with the tongue one
perceives tastes.'
3-2:5. `The eye is one Graha, and that is seized by form
as the Atigraha, for with the eye one sees forms.'
3-2:6. `The ear is one Graha, and that is seized by sound
as the Atigraha, for with the ear one hears
sounds.'
3-2:7. `The mind is one Graha, and that is seized by
desire as the Atigraha, for with the mind one desires
desires.'
3-2:8. `The arms are one Graha, and these are seized by
work as the Atigraha, for with the arms one
works work.'
3-2:9. `The skin is one Graha, and that is seized by touch
as the Atigraha, for with the skin one perceives
touch. These are the eight Grahas and the eight
Atigrahas.'
3-2:10. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `everything is the food of
death. What then is the deity to whom death is
food?'
`Fire (agni) is death, and that is the food of water. Death
is conquered again.'
3-2:11. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `when such a person (a
sage) dies, do the vital breaths (pranas) move out
of him or no?'
`No,' replied Yagnavalkya; `they are gathered up in him,
he swells, he is inflated, and thus inflated the
dead lies at rest.'
3-2:12. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `when such a man dies,
what does not leave him?'
`The name,' he replied; `for the name is endless, the
Visvedevas are endless, and by it he gains the endless
world.'
3-2:13. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `when the speech of this
dead person enters into the fire, breath into the
air, the eye into the sun, the mind into the moon, the
hearing into space, into the earth the body, into the
ether the self, into the shrubs the hairs of the body, into
the trees the hairs of the head, when the blood and
the seed are deposited in the water, where is then that
person?'
Yagnavalkya said: `Take my hand, my friend. We two
alone shall know of this; let this question of ours
not be (discussed) in public.' Then these two went out
and argued, and what they said was karman
(work), what they praised was karman, viz. that a man
becomes good by good work, and bad by bad work.
After that Garatkarava Artabhaga held his peace.
Section 3
Third Brahmana
3-3:1. Then Bhugyu Lahyayani asked. `Yagnavalkya,' he
said, `we wandered about as students, and came
to the house of Patankala Kapya. He had a daughter
who was possessed by a Gandharva. We asked him,
`Who art thou?' and he (the Gandharva) replied: `I am
Sudhanvan, the Angirasa.' And when we asked 
him about the ends of the world, we said to him, `Where
were the Parikshitas? Where then were the
Parikshitas, I ask thee, Yagnavalkya, where were the
Parikshitas?'
3-3:2. Yagnavalkya said: `He said to thee, I suppose,
that they went where those go who have performed
a horse-sacrifice.'
He said: `And where do they go who have performed a
horse-sacrifice?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `Thirty-two journeys of the car of the
sun is this world. The earth surrounds it on
every side, twice as large, and the ocean surrounds this
earth on every side, twice as large. Now there is
between them a space as large as the edge of a razor or
the wing of a mosquito. Indra, having become a
bird, handed them (through the space) to Vayu (the air),
and Vayu (the air), holding them within himself,
conveyed them to where they dwell who have performed
a horse-sacrifice. Somewhat in this way did he
praise Vayu indeed. Therefore Vayu (air) is everything by
itself, and Vayu is all things together. He who
knows this, conquers death.' After that Bhugyu
Lahyayani held his peace.
Section 4
Fourth Brahmana
3-4:1. Then Ushasta Kakrayana asked. `Yagnavalkya,'
he said, `tell me the Brahman which is visible,
not invisible, the Self (atman), who is within all.'
Yagnavalkya replied: `This, thy Self, who is within all.'
`Which Self, O Yagnavalkya, is within all?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `He who breathes in the upbreathing, he is thy Self, and within all. He who
breathes in the down-breathing, he is thy Self, and within
all. He who breathes in the on-breathing, he is
thy Self, and within all. He who breathes in the outbreathing, he is thy Self, and within all. This is thy
Self, who is within all.' 
3-4:2. Ushasta Kakrayana said: `As one might say, this is
a cow, this is a horse, thus has this been
explained by thee. Tell me the Brahman which is visible,
not invisible, the Self, who is within all.'
Yagnavalkya replied: `This, thy Self, who is within all.'
`Which Self, O Yagnavalkya, is within all?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `Thou couldst not see the (true)
seer of sight, thou couldst not hear the (true) hearer
of hearing, nor perceive the perceiver of perception, nor
know the knower of knowledge. This is thy Self,
who is within all. Everything also is of evil.' After that
Ushasta Kakrayana held his peace.
Section 5
Fifth Brahmana
3-5:1. Then Kahola Kaushitakeya asked. `Yagnavalkya,'
he said, `tell me the Brahman which is visible,
not invisible, the Self (atman), who is within all.'
Yagnavalkya replied: `This, thy Self, who is within all.'
`Which Self, O Yagnavalkya, is within all?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `He who overcomes hunger and
thirst, sorrow, passion, old age, and death. When
Brahmanas know that Self, and have risen above the
desire for sons, wealth, and (new) worlds, they
wander about as mendicants. For a desire for sons is
desire for wealth, a desire for wealth is desire for
worlds. Both these are indeed desires. Therefore let a
Brahmana, after he has done with learning, wish to
stand by real strength; after he has done with that
strength and learning, he becomes a Muni (a Yogin);
and after he has done with what is not the knowledge of a
Muni, and with what is the knowledge of a
Muni, he is a Brahmana. By whatever means he has
become a Brahmana, he is such indeed. Everything
else is of evil.' After that Kahola Kaushitakeya held his
peace. 
Section 6
Sixth Brahmana
3-6:1. Then Gargi Vakaknavi asked. `Yagnavalkya,' she
said, `everything here is woven, like warp and
woof, in water. What then is that in which water is woven,
like warp and woof?'
`In air, O Gargi,' he replied.
`In what then is air woven, like warp and woof?'
`In the worlds of the sky, O Gargi,' he replied.
`In what then are the worlds of the sky woven, like warp
and woof?'
`In the worlds of the Gandharvas, O Gargi,' he replied.
`In what then are the worlds of the Gandharvas woven,
like warp and woof?'
`In the worlds of Aditya (sun), O Gargi,' he replied.
`In what then are the worlds of Aditya (sun) woven, like
warp and woof?'
`In the worlds of Kandra (moon), O Gargi,' he replied.
`In what then are the worlds of Kandra (moon) woven, like
warp and woof?'
`In the worlds of the Nakshatras (stars), O Gargi,' he
replied.
`In what then are the worlds of the Nakshatras (stars)
woven, like warp and woof?'
`In the worlds of the Devas (gods), O Gargi,' he replied.
`In what then are the worlds of the Devas (gods) woven,
like warp and woof?'
`In the worlds of Indra, O Gargi,' he replied. 
`In what then are the worlds of Indra woven, like warp and
woof?'
`In the worlds of Pragapati, O Gargi,' he replied.
`In what then are the worlds of Pragapati woven, like
warp and woof?'
`In the worlds of Brahman, O Gargi,' he replied.
`In what then are the worlds of Brahman woven, like warp
and woof?'
Yagnavalkya said: `O Gargi, Do not ask too much, lest thy
head should fall off. Thou askest too much
about a deity about which we are not to ask too much.
Do not ask too much, O Gargi.' After that Gargi
Vakaknavi held her peace.
Section 7
Seventh Brahmana
3-7:1. Then Uddalaka Aruni asked. `Yagnavalkya,' he
said, `we dwelt among the Madras in the houses
of Patankala Kapya, studying the sacrifice. His wife was
possessed of a Gandharva, and we asked him:
"Who art thou?" He answered: "I am Kabandha
Atharvana." And he said to Patankala Kapya and to (us)
students: "Dost thou know, Kapya, that thread by which
this world and the other world, and all beings are
strung together?" And Patankala Kapya replied: "I do not
know it, Sir." He said again to Patankala
Kapya and to (us) students: "Dost thou know, Kapya, that
puller (ruler) within (antaryamin), who within
pulls (rules) this world and the other world and all
beings?" And Patankala Kapya replied: "I do not
know it, Sir." He said again to Patankala Kapya and to
(us) students: "He, O Kapya, who knows that
thread and him who pulls (it) within, he knows Brahman,
he knows the worlds, he knows the Devas, he
knows the Vedas, he knows the Bhutas (creatures), he
knows the Self, he knows everything." Thus did he
(the Gandharva) say to them, and I know it. If thou, O
Yagnavalkya, without knowing that string and the 
puller within, drivest away those Brahma-cows (the cows
offered as a prize to him who best knows
Brahman), thy head will fall off.'
Yagnavalkya said: `O Gautama, I believe I know that
thread and the puller within.'
The other said: `Anybody may say, I know, I know. Tell
what thou knowest.'
3-7:2. Yagnavalkya said: `Vayu (air) is that thread, O
Gautama. By air, as by a thread, O Gautama, this
world and the other world, and all creatures are strung
together. Therefore, O Gautama, people say of a
dead person that his limbs have become unstrung; for by
air, as by a thread, O Gautama, they were strung
together.'
The other said: `So it is, O Yagnavalkya. Tell now (who
is) the puller within.'
3-7:3. Yagnavalkya said: `He who dwells in the earth,
and within the earth, whom the earth does not
know, whose body the earth is, and who pulls (rules) the
earth within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler)
within, the immortal.'
3-7:4. `He who dwells in the water, and within the water,
whom the water does not know, whose body the
water is, and who pulls (rules) the water within, he is thy
Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'
3-7:5. `He who dwells in the fire, and within the fire,
whom the fire does not know, whose body the fire
is, and who pulls (rules) the fire within, he is thy Self, the
puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'
3-7:6. `He who dwells in the sky, and within the sky,
whom the sky does not know, whose body the sky
is, and who pulls (rules) the sky within, he is thy Self, the
puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'
3-7:7. `He who dwells in the air (vayu), and within the air,
whom the air does not know, whose body the
air is, and who pulls (rules) the air within, he is thy Self,
the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.' 
3-7:8. `He who dwells in the heaven (dyu), and within the
heaven, whom the heaven does not know,
whose body the heaven is, and who pulls (rules) the
heaven within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within,
the immortal.'
3-7:9. `He who dwells in the sun (aditya), and within the
sun, whom the sun does not know, whose body
the sun is, and who pulls (rules) the sun within, he is thy
Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'
3-7:10. `He who dwells in the space (disah), and within
the space, whom the space does not know, whose
body the space is, and who pulls (rules) the space within,
he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the
immortal.'
3-7:11. `He who dwells in the moon and stars (kandratarakam), and within the moon and stars, whom
the moon and stars do not know, whose body the moon
and stars are, and who pulls (rules) the moon and
stars within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the
immortal.'
3-7:12. `He who dwells in the ether (akasa), and within
the ether, whom the ether does not know, whose
body the ether is, and who pulls (rules) the ether within,
he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the
immortal.'
3-7:13. `He who dwells in the darkness (tamas), and
within the darkness, whom the darkness does not
know, whose body the darkness is, and who pulls (rules)
the darkness within, he is thy Self, the puller
(ruler) within, the immortal.'
3-7:14. `He who dwells in the light (tegas), and within the
light, whom the light does not know, whose
body the light is, and who pulls (rules) the light within, he
is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the
immortal.'
So far with respect to the gods (adhidaivatam); now with
respect to beings (adhibhutam). 
3-7:15. Yagnavalkya said; `He who dwells in all beings,
and within all beings, whom all beings do not
know, whose body all beings are, and who pulls (rules) all
beings within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler)
within, the immortal.'
3-7:16. `He who dwells in the breath (prana), and within
the breath, whom the breath does not know,
whose body the breath is, and who pulls (rules) the
breath within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within,
the immortal.'
3-7:17. `He who dwells in the tongue (vak), and within
the tongue, whom the tongue does not know,
whose body the tongue is, and who pulls (rules) the
tongue within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within,
the immortal.'
3-7:18. `He who dwells in the eye, and within the eye,
whom the eye does not know, whose body the eye
is, and who pulls (rules) the eye within, he is thy Self, the
puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'
3-7:19. `He who dwells in the ear, and within the ear,
whom the ear does not know, whose body the ear
is, and who pulls (rules) the ear within, he is thy Self, the
puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'
3-7:20. `He who dwells in the mind, and within the mind,
whom the mind does not know, whose body
the mind is, and who pulls (rules) the mind within, he is
thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'
3-7:21. `He who dwells in the skin, and within the skin,
whom the skin does not know, whose body the
skin is, and who pulls (rules) the skin within, he is thy Self,
the puller (ruler) within, the immortal.'
3-7:22. `He who dwells in knowledge, and within
knowledge, whom knowledge does not know, whose
body knowledge is, and who pulls (rules) knowledge
within, he is thy Self, the puller (ruler) within, the
immortal.'
3-7:23. `He who dwells in the seed, and within the seed,
whom the seed does not know, whose body the 
seed is, and who pulls (rules) the seed within, he is thy
Self, the puller (ruler) within, the immortal;
unseen, but seeing; unheard, but hearing; unperceived,
but perceiving; unknown, but knowing. There is
no other seer but he, there is no other hearer but he,
there is no other perceiver but he, there is no other
knower but he. This is thy Self, the ruler within, the
immortal. Everything else is of evil.' After that
Uddalaka Aruni held his peace.
Section 8
Eighth Brahmana
3-8:1. Then Vakaknavi said: `Venerable Brahmanas, I
shall ask him two questions. If he will answer
them, none of you, I think, will defeat him in any argument
concerning Brahman.'
Yagnavalkya said: `Ask, O Gargi.'
3-8:2. She said: `O Yagnavalkya, as the son of a warrior
from the Kasis or Videhas might string his
loosened bow, take two pointed foe-piercing arrows in his
hand and rise to do battle, I have risen to fight
thee with two questions. Answer me these questions.'
Yagnavalkya said: `Ask, O Gargi.'
3-8:3. She said: `O Yagnavalkya, that of which they say
that it is above the heavens, beneath the earth,
embracing heaven and earth, past, present, and future,
tell me in what is it woven, like warp and woof?'
3-8:4. Yagnavalkya said: `That of which they say that it is
above the heavens, beneath the earth,
embracing heaven and earth, past, present, and future,
that is woven, like warp and woof, in the ether
(akasa).'
3-8:5. She said: `I bow to thee, O Yagnavalkya, who hast
solved me that question. Get thee ready for the
second.'
Yagnavalkya said: `Ask, O Gargi.' 
3-8:6. She said: `O Yagnavalkya, that of which they say
that it is above the heavens, beneath the earth,
embracing heaven and earth, past, present, and future,
tell me in what is it woven, like warp and woof?
3-8:7. Yagnavalkya said: `That of which they say that it is
above the heavens, beneath the earth,
embracing heaven and earth, past, present, and future,
that is woven, like warp and woof, in the ether.'
Gargi said: `In what then is the ether woven, like warp
and woof?'
3-8:8. He said: `O Gargi, the Brahmanas call this the
Akshara (the imperishable). It is neither coarse nor
fine, neither short nor long, neither red (like fire) nor fluid
(like water); it is without shadow, without
darkness, without air, without ether, without attachment,
without taste, without smell, without eyes,
without ears, without speech, without mind, without light
(vigour), without breath, without a mouth (or
door), without measure, having no within and no without,
it devours nothing, and no one devours it.'
3-8:9. `By the command of that Akshara (the
imperishable), O Gargi, sun and moon stand apart. By
the
command of that Akshara, O Gargi, heaven and earth
stand apart. By the command of that Akshara, O
Gargi, what are called moments (nimesha), hours
(muhurta), days and nights, half-months, months,
seasons, years, all stand apart. By the command of that
Akshara, O Gargi, some rivers flow to the East
from the white mountains, others to the West, or to any
other quarter. By the command of that Akshara,
O Gargi, men praise those who give, the gods follow the
sacrificer, the fathers the Darvi-offering.'
3-8:10. `Whosoever, O Gargi, without knowing that
Akshara (the imperishable), offers oblations in this
world, sacrifices, and performs penance for a thousand
years, his work will have an end. Whosoever, O
Gargi, without knowing this Akshara, departs this world,
he is miserable (like a slave). But he, O Gargi,
who departs this world, knowing this Akshara, he is a
Brahmana.' 
3-8:11. `That Brahman,' O Gargi, `is unseen, but seeing;
unheard, but hearing; unperceived, but
perceiving; unknown, but knowing. There is nothing that
sees but it, nothing that hears but it, nothing
that perceives but it, nothing that knows but it. In that
Akshara then, O Gargi, the ether is woven, like
warp and woof.'
3-8:12. Then said Gargi: `Venerable Brahmans, you may
consider it a great thing, if you get off by
bowing before him. No one, I believe, will defeat him in
any argument concerning Brahman.' After that
Vakaknavi held her peace.
Section 9
Ninth Brahmana
3-9:1. Then Vidagdha Sakalya asked him: `How many
gods are there, O Yagnavalkya?' He replied with
this very Nivid: `As many as are mentioned in the Nivid of
the hymn of praise addressed to the
Visvedevas, viz. three and three hundred, three and three
thousand.'
`Yes,' he said, and asked again: `How many gods are
there really, O Yagnavalkya?'
`Thirty-three,' he said.
`Yes,' he said, and asked again: `How many gods are
there really, O Yagnavalkya?'
`Six,' he said.
`Yes,' he said, and asked again: `How many gods are
there really, O Yagnavalkya?'
`Three,' he said.
`Yes,' he said, and asked again: `How many gods are
there really, O Yagnavalkya?'
`Two,' he said. 
`Yes,' he said, and asked again: `How many gods are
there really, O Yagnavalkya?'
`One and a half (adhyardha),' he said.
`Yes,' he said, and asked again: `How many gods are
there really, O Yagnavalkya?'
`One,' he said.
`Yes,' he said, and asked: `Who are these three and three
hundred, three and three thousand?'
3-9:2. Yagnavalkya replied: `They are only the various
powers of them, in reality there are only thirtythree gods.'
He asked: `Who are those thirty-three?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `The eight Vasus, the eleven
Rudras, the twelve Adityas. They make thirty-one, and
Indra and Pragapati make the thirty-three.'
3-9:3. He asked: `Who are the Vasus.'
Yagnavalkya replied: `Agni (fire), Prithivi (earth), Vayu
(air), Antariksha (sky), Aditya (sun), Dyu
(heaven), Kandramas (moon), the Nakshatras (stars),
these are the Vasus, for in them all that dwells (this
world) rests; and therefore they are called Vasus.'
3-9:4. He asked: `Who are the Rudras?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `These ten vital breaths (pranas, the
senses, i.e. the five gnanendriyas, and the five
karmendriyas), and Atman, as the eleventh. When they
depart from this mortal body, they make us cry
(rodayanti), and because they make us cry, they are
called Rudras.'
3-9:5. He asked: `Who are the Adityas?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `The twelve months of the year, and
they are Adityas, because they move along
(yanti), taking up everything (adadanah). Because they
move along, taking up everything, therefore they 
are called Adityas.'
3-9:6. He asked: `And who is Indra, and who is
Pragapati?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `Indra is thunder, Pragapati is the
sacrifice.'
He asked: `And what is the thunder?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `The thunderbolt.'
He asked: `And what is the sacrifice?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `The (sacrificial) animals.'
3-9:7. He asked: `Who are the six?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `Agni (fire), Prithivi (earth), Vayu
(air), Antariksha (sky), Aditya (sun), Dyu
(heaven), they are the six, for they are all this, the six.'
3-9:8. He asked: `Who are the three gods?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `These three worlds, for in them all
these gods exist.'
He asked: `Who are the two gods?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `Food and breath.'
He asked: `Who is the one god and a half?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `He that blows.'
3-9:9. Here they say: `How is it that he who blows like
one only, should be called one and a half
(adhyardha)?' And the answer is: `Because, when the
wind was blowing, everything grew (adhyardhnot).'
He asked: `Who is the one god?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `Breath (prana), and he is Brahman
(the Sutratman), and they call him That (tyad).'
3-9:10. Sakalya said: `Whosoever knows that person (or
god) whose dwelling (body) is the earth, whose
sight (world) is fire, whose mind is light, the principle of
every (living) self, he indeed is a teacher, O
Yagnavalkya.'
Yagnavalkya said: `I know that person, the principle of
every self, of whom thou speakest. This corporeal
(material, earthy) person, "he is he." But tell me, Sakalya,
who is his devata (deity)?'
Sakalya replied: `The Immortal.'
3-9:11. Sakalya said: `Whosoever knows that person
whose dwelling is love (a body capable of sensual
love), whose sight is the heart, whose mind is light, the
principle of every self, he indeed is a teacher,
O Yagnavalkya.'
Yagnavalkya replied: `I know that person, the principle of
every self, of whom thou speakest. This lovemade (loving) person, "he is he." But tell me, Sakalya,
who is his devata?'
Sakalya replied: `The women.'
3-9:12. Sakalya said: `Whosoever knows that person
whose dwelling are the colours, whose sight is the
eye, whose mind is light, the principle of every self, he
indeed is a teacher, O Yagnavalkya.'
Yagnavalkya replied: `I know that person, the principle of
every self, of whom thou speakest. That person
in the sun, "he is he." But tell me, Sakalya, who is his
devata?'
Sakalya replied: `The True.'
3-9:13. Sakalya said: `Whosoever knows that person
whose dwelling is ether, whose sight is the ear,
whose mind is light, the principle of every self, he indeed
is a teacher, O Yagnavalkya.'
Yagnavalkya replied: `I know that person, the principle of
every self, of whom thou speakest. The person 
who hears and answers, "he is he." But tell me, Sakalya,
who is his devata?'
Sakalya replied: `Space.'
3-9:14. Sakalya said: `Whosoever knows that person
whose dwelling is darkness, whose sight is the heart,
whose mind is light, the principle of every self, he indeed
is a teacher, O Yagnavalkya.'
Yagnavalkya replied: `I know that person, the principle of
every self, of whom thou speakest. The
shadowy person, "he is he." But tell me, Sakalya, who is
his devata?'
Sakalya replied: `Death.'
3-9:15. Sakalya said: `Whosoever knows that person
whose dwelling are (bright) colours, whose sight is
the eye, whose mind is light, the principle of every self,
he indeed is a teacher, O Yagnavalkya.'
Yagnavalkya replied: `I know that person, the principle of
every self, of whom thou speakest. The person
in the looking-glass, "he is he." But tell me, Sakalya, who
is his devata?'
Sakalya replied: `Vital breath'(asu).
3-9:16. Sakalya said: `Whosoever knows that person
whose dwelling is water, whose sight is the heart,
whose mind is light, the principle of every self, he indeed
is a teacher, O Yagnavalkya.'
Yagnavalkya replied: `I know that person, the principle of
every self, of whom thou speakest. The person
in the water, "he is he." But tell me, Sakalya, who is his
devata?'
Sakalya replied: `Varuna.'
3-9:17. Sakalya said: `Whosoever knows that person
whose dwelling is seed, whose sight is the heart,
whose mind is light, the principle of every self, he indeed
is a teacher, O Yagnavalkya.' 
Yagnavalkya replied: `I know that person, the principle of
every self, of whom thou speakest. The filial
person, "he is he." But tell me, Sakalya, who is his
devata?'
Sakalya replied: `Pragapati.'
3-9:18. Yagnavalkya said: `Sakalya, did those
Brahmanas (who themselves shrank from the contest)
make thee the victim?'
Sakalya said: `Yagnavalkya, because thou hast decried
the Brahmanas of the Kuru-Pankalas, what
Brahman dost thou know?'
3-9:19. Yagnavalkya said: `I know the quarters with their
deities and their abodes.'
Sakalya said: `If thou knowest the quarters with their
deities and their abodes,
3-9:20. `Which is thy deity in the Eastern quarter?'
Yagnavalkya said: `Aditya (the sun).'
Sakalya said: `In what does that Aditya abide?'
Yagnavalkya said: `In the eye.'
Sakalya said: `In what does the eye abide?'
Yagnavalkya said: `In the colours, for with the eye he
sees the colours.'
Sakalya said: `And in what then do the colours abide?'
Yagnavalkya said: `In the heart, for we know colours by
the heart, for colours abide in the heart.'
Sakalya said: `So it is indeed, O Yagnavalkya.'
3-9:21. Sakalya said: `Which is thy deity in the Southern
quarter?'
Yagnavalkya said: `Yama.' 
Sakalya said: `In what does that Yama abide?'
Yagnavalkya said: `In the sacrifice.'
Sakalya said: `In what does the sacrifice abide?'
Yagnavalkya said: `In the Dakshina. (the gifts to be given
to the priests).'
Sakalya said: `In what does the Dakshina abide?'
Yagnavalkya said: `In Sraddha (faith), for if a man
believes, then he gives Dakshina, and Dakshina truly
abides in faith.'
Sakalya said: `And in what then does faith abide?'
Yagnavalkya said: `In the heart, for by the heart faith
knows, and therefore faith abides in the heart.'
Sakalya said: `So it is indeed, O Yagnavalkya.'
3-9:22. Sakalya said: `Which is thy deity in the Western
quarter?'
Yagnavalkya said: `Varuna.'
Sakalya said: `In what does that Varuna abide?'
Yagnavalkya said: `In the water.'
Sakalya said: `In what does the water abide?'
Yagnavalkya said: `In the seed.'
Sakalya said: `And in what does the seed abide?'
Yagnavalkya said: `In the heart. And therefore also they
say of a son who is like his father, that he seems
as if slipt from his heart, or made from his heart; for the
seed abides in the heart.'
Sakalya said: `So it is indeed, O Yagnavalkya.'
3-9:23. Sakalya said: `Which is thy deity in the Northern
quarter?' 
Yagnavalkya said: `Soma.'
Sakalya said: `In what does that Soma abide?'
Yagnavalkya said: `In the Diksha.'
Sakalya said: `In what does the Diksha abide?'
Yagnavalkya said: `In the True; and therefore they say to
one who has performed the Diksha, Speak what
is true, for in the True indeed the Diksha abides.'
Sakalya said: `And in what does the True abide?'
Yagnavalkya said: `In the heart, for with the heart do we
know what is true, and in the heart indeed the
True abides.'
Sakalya said: `So it is indeed, O Yagnavalkya.'
3-9:24. Sakalya said: `Which is thy deity in the zenith?'
Yagnavalkya said: `Agni.'
Sakalya said: `In what does that Agni abide.'
Yagnavalkya said: `In speech.'
Sakalya said: `And in what does speech abide?'
Yagnavalkya said: `In the heart.'
Sakalya said: `And in what does the heart abide?'
3-9:25. Yagnavalkya said: `O Ahallika, when you think
the heart could be anywhere else away from us, if
it were away from us, the dogs might eat it, or the birds
tear it.'
3-9:26. Sakalya said: `And in what dost thou (thy body)
and the Self (thy heart) abide?'
Yagnavalkya said: `In the Prana (breath).'
Sakalya said: `In what does the Prana abide?' 
Yagnavalkya said: `In the Apana (down-breathing).'
Sakalya said: `In what does the Apana abide?'
Yagnavalkya said: `In the Vyana (back-breathing).'
Sakalya said: `In what does the Vyana abide?'
Yagnavalkya said: `In the Udana (the out-breathing).'
Sakalya said: `In what does the Udana abide?'
Yagnavalkya said: `In the Samana. That Self (atman) is
to be described by No, no! He is
incomprehensible, for he cannot be (is not)
comprehended; he is imperishable, for he cannot perish;
he is
unattached, for he does not attach himself; unfettered, he
does not suffer, he does not fail.'
`These are the eight abodes (the earth, &c.), the eight
worlds (fire, &c.), the eight gods (the immortal
food, &c.), the eight persons (the corporeal, &c.) He who
after dividing and uniting these persons, went
beyond (the Samana), that person, taught in the
Upanishads, I now ask thee (to teach me). If thou shalt
not explain him to me, thy head will fall.'
Sakalya did not know him, and his head fell, nay, thieves
took away his bones, mistaking them for
something else.
3-9:27. Then Yagnavalkya said: `Reverend Brahmanas,
whosoever among you desires to do so, may now
question me. Or question me, all of you. Or whosoever
among you desires it, I shall question him, or I
shall question all of you.
But those Brahmanas durst not (say anything).
3-9:28. Then Yagnavalkya questioned them with these
Slokas:
1. `As a mighty tree in the forest, so in truth is man, his
hairs are the leaves, his outer skin is the bark. 
2. `From his skin flows forth blood, sap from the skin (of
the tree); and thus from the wounded man
comes forth blood, as from a tree that is struck.
3. `The lumps of his flesh are (in the tree) the layers of
wood, the fibre is strong like the tendons. The
bones are the (hard) wood within, the marrow is made like
the marrow of the tree.
4. `But, while the tree, when felled, grows up again more
young from the root, from what root, tell me,
does a mortal grow up, after he has been felled by death?
5. `Do not say, "from seed," for seed is produced from
the living; but a tree, springing from a grain,
clearly rises again after death.
6. `If a tree is pulled up with the root, it will not grow
again; from what root then, tell me, does a mortal
grow up, after he has been felled by death?
7. `Once born, he is not born (again); for who should
create him again?'
`Brahman, who is knowledge and bliss, he is the
principle, both to him who gives gifts, and also to him
who stands firm, and knows.'

~ Chapter 4 ~
Fourth Adhyaya
Section 1
First Brahmana
4-1:1. When Ganaka Vaideha was sitting (to give
audience), Yagnavalkya approached, and Ganaka
Vaideha said: `Yagnavalkya, for what object did you
come, wishing for cattle, or for subtle questions?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `For both, Your Majesty; 
4-1:2. `Let us hear what anybody may have told you.'
Ganaka Vaideha replied: `Gitvan Sailini told me
that speech (vak) is Brahman.'
Yagnavalkya said: `As one who had (the benefit of a
good) father, mother, and teacher might tell, so did
Sailini tell you, that speech is Brahman; for what is the
use of a dumb person? But did he tell you the
body (ayatana) and the resting-place (pratishtha) of that
Brahman?'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `He did not tell me.'
Yagnavalkya said: `Your Majesty, this (Brahman) stands
on one leg only.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `Then tell me, Yagnavalkya.'
Yagnavalkya said: `The tongue is its body, ether its place,
and one should worship it as knowledge.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `What is the nature of that
knowledge?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `Your Majesty, speech itself (is
knowledge). For through speech, Your Majesty, a
friend is known (to be a friend), and likewise the Rigveda, Yagur-veda, Sama-veda, the Atharvangirasas,
the Itihasa (tradition), Purana-vidya (knowledge of the
past), the Upanishads, Slokas (verses), Sutras
(rules), Anuvyakhyanas and Vyakhyanas (commentaries,
&c.); what is sacrificed, what is poured out,
what is (to be) eaten and drunk, this world and the other
world, and all creatures. By speech alone, Your
Majesty, Brahman is known, speech indeed, O King, is
the Highest Brahman. Speech does not desert him
who worships that (Brahman) with such knowledge, all
creatures approach him, and having become a
god, he goes to the gods.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `I shall give you (for this) a
thousand cows with a bull as big as an elephant.'
Yagnavalkya said: `My father was of opinion that one
should not accept a reward without having fully
instructed a pupil.' 
4-1:3. Yagnavalkya said: `Let us hear what anybody may
have told you.'
Ganaka Vaideha replied: `Udanka Saulbayana told me
that life (prana) is Brahman.'
Yagnavalkya said: `As one who had (the benefit of a
good) father, mother, and teacher might tell, so did
Udanka Saulbayana tell you that life is Brahman; for what
is the use of a person without life? But did he
tell you the body and the resting-place of that Brahman?'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `He did not tell me.'
Yagnavalkya said: `Your Majesty, this (Brahman) stands
on one leg only.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `Then tell me, Yagnavalkya.'
Yagnavalkya said: `Breath is its body, ether its place, and
one should worship it as what is dear.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `What is the nature of that which is
dear?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `Your Majesty, life itself (is that
which is dear);' because for the sake of life, Your
Majesty, a man sacrifices even for him who is unworthy of
sacrifice, he accepts presents from him who is
not worthy to bestow presents, nay, he goes to a country,
even when there is fear of being hurt, for the
sake of life. Life, O King, is the Highest Brahman. Life
does not desert him who worships that
(Brahman) with such knowledge, all creatures approach
him, and having become a god, he goes to the
gods.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `I shall give you (for this) a
thousand cows with a bull as big as an elephant.'
Yagnavalkya said: `My father was of opinion that one
should not accept a reward without having fully
instructed a pupil.'
4-1:4. Yagnavalkya said: `Let us hear what anybody may
have told you.'
Ganaka Vaideha replied: `Barku Varshna told me that
sight (kakshus) is Brahman.'
Yagnavalkya said: `As one who had (the benefit of a
good) father, mother, and teacher might tell, so did
Barku Varshna tell you that sight is Brahman; for what is
the use of a person who cannot see? But did he
tell you the body and the resting-place of that Brahman?'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `He did not tell me.'
Yagnavalkya said: `Your Majesty, this (Brahman) stands
on one leg only.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `Then tell me, Yagnavalkya.'
Yagnavalkya said: `The eye is its body, ether its place,
and one should worship it as what is true.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `What is the nature of that which is
true?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `Your Majesty, sight itself (is that
which is true); for if they say to a man who sees
with his eye, "Didst thou see?" and he says, "I saw," then
it is true. Sight, O King, is the Highest
Brahman. Sight does not desert him who worships that
(Brahman) with such knowledge, all creatures
approach him, and having become a god, he goes to the
gods.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `I shall give you (for this) a
thousand cows with a bull as big as an elephant.'
Yagnavalkya said: `My father was of opinion that one
should not accept a reward without having fully
instructed a pupil.'
4-1:5. Yagnavalkya said: `Let us hear what anybody may
have told you.'
Ganaka Vaideha replied: `Gardabhivibhita Bharadvaga
told me that hearing ( srotra) is Brahman.' 
Yagnavalkya said: `As one who had (the benefit of a
good) father, mother, and teacher might tell, so did
Gardabhivibhita Bharadvaga tell you that hearing is
Brahman; for what is the use of a person who cannot
hear? But did he tell you the body and the resting-place
of that Brahman?'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `He did not tell me.'
Yagnavalkya said: `Your Majesty, this (Brahman) stands
on one leg only.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `Then tell me, Yagnavalkya.'
Yagnavalkya said: `The ear is its body, ether its place,
and we should worship it as what is endless.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `What is the nature of that which is
endless?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `Your Majesty, space (disah) itself
(is that which is endless), and therefore to
whatever space (quarter) he goes, he never comes to the
end of it. For space is endless. Space indeed, O
King, is hearing, and hearing indeed, O King, is the
Highest Brahman. Hearing does not desert him who
worships that (Brahman) with such knowledge, all
creatures approach him, and having become a god, he
goes to the gods.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `I shall give you (for this) a
thousand cows with a bull as big as an elephant.'
Yagnavalkya said: `My father was of opinion that one
should not accept a reward without having fully
instructed a pupil.'
4-1:6. Yagnavalkya said: `Let us hear what anybody may
have told you.'
Ganaka Vaideha replied: `Satyakama Gabala told me that
mind (manas) is Brahman.'
Yagnavalkya said: `As one who had (the benefit of a
good) father, mother, and teacher might tell, so did 
Satyakama Gabala tell you that mind is Brahman; for
what is the use of a person without mind? But did
he tell you the body and the resting-place of that
Brahman?'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `He did not tell me.'
Yagnavalkya said: `Your Majesty, this (Brahman) stands
on one leg only.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `Then tell me, Yagnavalkya.'
Yagnavalkya said: `Mind itself is its body, ether its place,
and we should worship it as bliss.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `What is the nature of bliss?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `Your Majesty, mind itself; for with
the mind does a man desire a woman, and a
like son is born of her, and he is bliss. Mind indeed, O
King, is the Highest Brahman. Mind does not
desert him who worships that (Brahman) with such
knowledge, all creatures approach him, and having
become a god, he goes to the gods.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `I shall give you (for this) a
thousand cows with a bull as big as an elephant.'
Yagnavalkya said: `My father was of opinion that one
should not accept a reward without having fully
instructed a pupil.'
4-1:7. Yagnavalkya said: `Let us hear what anybody may
have told you.'
Ganaka Vaideha replied: `Vidagdha Sakalya told me that
the heart (hridaya) is Brahman.'
Yagnavalkya said: `As one who had (the benefit of a
good) father, mother, and teacher might tell, so did
Vidagdha Sakalya tell you that the heart is Brahman; for
what is the use of a person without a heart? But
did he tell you the body and the resting-place of that
Brahman?'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `He did not tell me.' 
Yagnavalkya said: `Your Majesty, this (Brahman) stands
on one leg only.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `Then tell me, Yagnavalkya.'
Yagnavalkya said: `The heart itself is its body, ether its
place, and we should worship it as certainty
(sthiti).'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `What is the nature of certainty?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `Your Majesty, the heart itself; for
the heart indeed, O King, is the body of all
things, the heart is the resting-place of all things, for in the
heart, O King, all things rest. The heart
indeed, O King, is the Highest Brahman. The heart does
not desert him who worships that (Brahman)
with such knowledge, all creatures approach him, and
having become a god, he goes to the gods.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `I shall give you (for this) a
thousand cows with a bull as big as an elephant.'
Yagnavalkya said: `My father was of opinion that one
should not accept a reward without having fully
instructed a pupil.'
Section 2
Second Brahmana
4-2:1. Ganaka Vaideha, descending from his throne,
said: `I bow to you, O Yagnavalkya, teach me.'
Yagnavalkya said: `Your Majesty, as a man who wishes
to make a long journey, would furnish himself
with a chariot or a ship, thus is your mind well furnished
by these Upanishads. You are honourable, and
wealthy, you have learnt the Vedas and been told the
Upanishads. Whither then will you go when
departing hence?'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `Sir, I do not know whither I shall
go.' 
Yagnavalkya said: `Then I shall tell you this, whither you
will go.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `Tell it, Sir.'
4-2:2. Yagnavalkya said: `That person who is in the right
eye, he is called Indha, and him who is Indha
they call indeed Indra mysteriously, for the gods love
what is mysterious, and dislike what is evident.
4-2:3. `Now that which in the shape of a person is in the
right eye, is his wife, Virag. Their meetingplace is the ether within the heart, and their food the red
lump within the heart. Again, their covering is
that which is like net-work within the heart, and the road
on which they move (from sleep to waking) is
the artery that rises upwards from the heart. Like a hair
divided into a thousand parts, so are the veins of
it, which are called Hita, placed firmly within the heart.
Through these indeed that (food) flows on
flowing, and he (the Taigasa) receives as it were purer
food than the corporeal Self (the Vaisvanara).
4-2:4. `His (the Taigasa's) Eastern quarter are the pranas
(breath) which go to the East;
`His Southern quarter are the pranas which go to the
South;
`His Western quarter are the pranas which go to the
West;
`His Northern quarter are the pranas which go to the
North;
`His Upper (Zenith) quarter are the pranas which go
upward;
`His Lower (Nadir) quarter are the pranas which go
downward;
`All the quarters are all the pranas. And he (the Atman in
that state) can only be described by No, no! He
is incomprehensible, for he cannot be comprehended; he
is undecaying, for he cannot decay; he is not 
attached, for he does not attach himself; he is unbound,
he does not suffer, he does not perish. O Ganaka,
you have indeed reached fearlessness,' thus said
Yagnavalkya.
Then Ganaka said: `May that fearlessness come to you
also who teachest us fearlessness. I bow to you.
Here are the Videhas, and here am I (thy slave).'
Section 3
Third Brahmana
4-3:1. Yagnavalkya came to Ganaka Vaideha, and he did
not mean to speak with him. But when
formerly Ganaka Vaideha and Yagnavalkya had a
disputation on the Agnihotra, Yagnavalkya had granted
him a boon, and he chose (for a boon) that he might be
free to ask him any question he liked.
Yagnavalkya granted it, and thus the King was the first to
ask him a question.
4-3:2. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `what is the light of man?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `The sun, O King; for, having the
sun alone for his light, man sits, moves about,
does his work, and returns.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `So indeed it is, O Yagnavalkya.'
4-3:3. Ganaka Vaideha said: `When the sun has set, O
Yagnavalkya, what is then the light of man?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `The moon indeed is his light; for,
having the moon alone for his light, man sits,
moves about, does his work, and returns.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `So indeed it is, O Yagnavalkya.'
4-3:4. Ganaka Vaideha said: `When the sun has set, O
Yagnavalkya, and the moon has set, what is the
light of man?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `Fire indeed is his light; for, having
fire alone for his light, man sits, moves about,
does his work, and returns.' 
4-3:5. Ganaka Vaideha said: `When the sun has set, O
Yagnavalkya, and the moon has set, and the fire is
gone out, what is then the light of man?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `Sound indeed is his light; for,
having sound alone for his light, man sits, moves
about, does his work, and returns. Therefore, O King,
when one cannot see even one's own hand, yet
when a sound is raised, one goes towards it.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `So indeed it is, O Yagnavalkya.'
4-3:6. Ganaka Vaideha said: `When the sun has set, O
Yagnavalkya, and the moon has set, and the fire is
gone out, and the sound hushed, what is then the light of
man?'
Yagnavalkya said: `The Self indeed is his light; for, having
the Self alone as his light, man sits, moves
about, does his work, and returns.'
4-3:7. Ganaka Vaideha said: `Who is that Self?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `He who is within the heart,
surrounded by the Pranas (senses), the person of light,
consisting of knowledge. He, remaining the same,
wanders along the two worlds, as if thinking, as if
moving. During sleep (in dream) he transcends this world
and all the forms of death (all that falls under
the sway of death, all that is perishable).
4-3:8. `On being born that person, assuming his body,
becomes united with all evils; when he departs and
dies, he leaves all evils behind.
4-3:9. `And there are two states for that person, the one
here in this world, the other in the other world,
and as a third an intermediate state, the state of sleep.
When in that intermediate state, he sees both those
states together, the one here in this world, and the other
in the other world. Now whatever his admission
to the other world may be, having gained that admission,
he sees both the evils and the blessings.
`And when he falls asleep, then after having taken away
with him the material from the whole world,
destroying and building it up again, he sleeps (dreams) by
his own light. In that state the person is selfilluminated.
4-3:10. `There are no (real) chariots in that state, no
horses, no roads, but he himself sends forth (creates)
chariots, horses, and roads. There are no blessings
there, no happiness, no joys, but he himself sends forth
(creates) blessings, happiness, and joys. There are no
tanks there, no lakes, no rivers, but he himself
sends forth (creates) tanks, lakes, and rivers. He indeed
is the maker.
4-3:11. `On this there are these verses:
`After having subdued by sleep all that belongs to the
body, he, not asleep himself, looks down upon the
sleeping (senses). Having assumed light, he goes again
to his place, the golden person, the lonely bird.
(1)
4-3:12. `Guarding with the breath (prana, life) the lower
nest, the immortal moves away from the nest;
that immortal one goes wherever he likes, the golden
person, the lonely bird. (2)
4-3:13. `Going up and down in his dream, the god makes
manifold shapes for himself, either rejoicing
together with women, or laughing (with his friends), or
seeing terrible sights. (3)
4-3:14. `People may see his playground, but himself no
one ever sees. Therefore they say, "Let no one
wake a man suddenly, for it is not easy to remedy, if he
does not get back (rightly to his body)."
`Here some people (object and) say: "No, this (sleep) is
the same as the place of waking, for what he sees
while awake, that only he sees when asleep." No, here
(in sleep) the person is self-illuminated (as we
explained before).'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `I give you, Sir, a thousand.
Speak on for the sake of (my) emancipation.' 
4-3:15. Yagnavalkya said: `That (person) having enjoyed
himself in that state of bliss (samprasada, deep
sleep), having moved about and seen both good and evil,
hastens back again as he came, to the place from
which he started (the place of sleep), to dream. And
whatever he may have seen there, he is not followed
(affected) by it, for that person is not attached to
anything.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `So it is indeed, Yagnavalkya. I
give you, Sir, a thousand. Speak on for the sake of
emancipation.'
4-3:16. Yagnavalkya said: `That (person) having enjoyed
himself in that sleep (dream), having moved
about and seen both good and evil, hastens back again
as he came, to the place from which he started, to
be awake. And whatever he may have seen there, he is
not followed (affected) by it, for that person is not
attached to anything.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `So it is indeed, Yagnavalkya. I
give you, Sir, a thousand. Speak on for the sake of
emancipation.'
4-3:17. Yagnavalkya said: `That (person) having enjoyed
himself in that state of waking, having moved
about and seen both good and evil, hastens back again
as he came, to the place from which he started, to
the state of sleeping (dream).
4-3:18. `In fact, as a large fish moves along the two
banks of a river, the right and the left, so does that
person move along these two states, the state of sleeping
and the state of waking.
4-3:19. `And as a falcon, or any other (swift) bird, after he
has roamed about here in the air, becomes
tired, and folding his wings is carried to his nest, so does
that person hasten to that state where, when
asleep, he desires no more desires, and dreams no more
dreams.
4-3:20. `There are in his body the veins called Hita,
which are as small as a hair divided a thousandfold, 
full of white, blue, yellow, green, and red. Now when, as
it were, they kill him, when, as it were, they
overcome him, when, as it were, an elephant chases him,
when, as it were, he falls into a well, he fancies,
through ignorance, that danger which he (commonly)
sees in waking. But when he fancies that he is, as it
were, a god, or that he is, as it were, a king, or "I am this
altogether," that is his highest world.
4-3:21. `This indeed is his (true) form, free from desires,
free from evil, free from fear. Now as a man,
when embraced by a beloved wife, knows nothing that is
without, nothing that is within, thus this person,
when embraced by the intelligent (pragna) Self, knows
nothing that is without, nothing that is within.
This indeed is his (true) form, in which his wishes are
fulfilled, in which the Self (only) is his wish, in
which no wish is left, free from any sorrow.
4-3:22. `Then a father is not a father, a mother not a
mother, the worlds not worlds, the gods not gods,
the Vedas not Vedas. Then a thief is not a thief, a
murderer not a murderer, a Kandala not a Kandala, a
Paulkasa not a Paulkasa, a Sramana not a Sramana, a
Tapasa not a Tapasa. He is not followed by good,
not followed by evil, for he has then overcome all the
sorrows of the heart.
4-3:23. `And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti)
he does not see, yet he is seeing, though he
does not see. For sight is inseparable from the seer,
because it cannot perish. But there is then no second,
nothing else different from him that he could see.
4-3:24. `And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti)
he does not smell, yet he is smelling, though he
does not smell. For smelling is inseparable from the
smeller, because it cannot perish. But there is then
no second, nothing else different from him that he could
smell.
4-3:25. `And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti)
he does not taste, yet he is tasting, though he
does not taste. For tasting is inseparable from the taster,
because it cannot perish. But there is then no 
second, nothing else different from him that he could
taste.
4-3:26. `And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti)
he does not speak, yet he is speaking, though
he does not speak. For speaking is inseparable from the
speaker, because it cannot perish. But there is
then no second, nothing else different from him that he
could speak.
4-3:27. `And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti)
he does not hear, yet he is hearing, though he
does not hear. For hearing is inseparable from the
hearer, because it cannot perish. But there is then no
second, nothing else different from him that he could
hear.
4-3:28. `And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti)
he does not think, yet he is thinking, though he
does not think. For thinking is inseparable from the
thinker, because it cannot perish. But there is then
no second, nothing else different from him that he could
think.
4-3:29. `And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti)
he does not touch, yet he is touching, though he
does not touch. For touching is inseparable from the
toucher, because it cannot perish. But there is then
no second, nothing else different from him that he could
think.
4-3:30. `And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti)
he does not know, yet he is knowing, though he
does not know. For knowing is inseparable from the
knower, because it cannot perish. But there is then
no second, nothing else different from him that he could
know.
4-3:31. `When (in waking and dreaming) there is, as it
were, another, then can one see the other, then
can one smell the other, then can one speak to the other,
then can one hear the other, then can one think
the other, then can one touch the other, then can one
know the other.
4-3:32. `An ocean is that one seer, without any duality;
this is the Brahma-world, O King.' Thus did
Yagnavalkya teach him. This is his highest goal, this is
his highest success, this is his highest world, this
is his highest bliss. All other creatures live on a small
portion of that bliss.
4-3:33. `If a man is healthy, wealthy, and lord of others,
surrounded by all human enjoyments, that is the
highest blessing of men. Now a hundred of these human
blessings make one blessing of the fathers who
have conquered the world (of the fathers). A hundred
blessings of the fathers who have conquered this
world make one blessing in the Gandharva world. A
hundred blessings in the Gandharva world make one
blessing of the Devas by merit (work, sacrifice), who
obtain their godhead by merit. A hundred blessings
of the Devas by merit make one blessing of the Devas by
birth, also (of) a Srotriya who is without sin, and
not overcome by desire. A hundred blessings of the
Devas by birth make one blessing in the world of
Pragapati, also (of) a Srotriya who is without sin, and not
overcome by desire. A hundred blessings in the
world of Pragapati make one blessing in the world of
Brahman, also (of) a Srotriya who is without sin,
and not overcome by desire. And this is the highest
blessing.
`This is the Brahma-world, O king,' thus spake
Yagnavalkya.
Ganaka Vaideha said: `I give you, Sir, a thousand.
Speak on for the sake of (my) emancipation.'
Then Yagnavalkya was afraid lest the King, having
become full of understanding, should drive him from
all his positions.
4-3:34. And Yagnavalkya said: `That (person), having
enjoyed himself in that state of sleeping (dream),
having moved about and seen both good and bad,
hastens back again as he came, to the place from which
he started, to the state of waking.
4-3:35. `Now as a heavy-laden carriage moves along
groaning, thus does this corporeal Self, mounted by 
the intelligent Self, move along groaning, when a man is
thus going to expire.
4-3:36. `And when (the body) grows weak through old
age, or becomes weak through illness, at that time
that person, after separating himself from his members,
as an Amra (mango), or Udumbara (fig), or
Pippala-fruit is separated from the stalk, hastens back
again as he came, to the place from which he
started, to (new) life.
4-3:37. `And as policemen, magistrates, equerries, and
governors wait for a king who is coming back,
with food and drink, saying, "He comes back, he
approaches," thus do all the elements wait on him who
knows this, saying, "That Brahman comes, that Brahman
approaches."
4-3:38. `And as policemen, magistrates, equerries, and
governors gather round a king who is departing,
thus do all the senses (pranas) gather round the Self at
the time of death, when a man is thus going to
expire.'
Section 4
Fourth Brahmana
4-4:1. Yagnavalkya continued: `Now when that Self,
having sunk into weakness, sinks, as it were, into
unconsciousness, then gather those senses (pranas)
around him, and he, taking with him those elements of
light, descends into the heart. When that person in the
eye turns away, then he ceases to know any forms.
4-4:2. `"He has become one," they say, "he does not
see." "He has become one," they say, "he does not
smell." "He has become one," they say, "he does not
does not taste." "He has become one," they say, "he
does not speak." "He has become one," they say, "he
does not hear." "He has become one," they say, "he
does not think." "He has become one," they say, "he
does not touch." "He has become one," they say, "he
does not know." The point of his heart becomes lighted
up, and by that light the Self departs, either 
through the eye, or through the skull, or through other
places of the body. And when he thus departs, life
(the chief prana) departs after him, and when life thus
departs, all the other vital spirits (pranas) depart
after it. He is conscious, and being conscious he follows
and departs.
`Then both his knowledge and his work take hold of him,
and his acquaintance with former things.'
4-4:3. `And as a caterpillar, after having reached the end
of a blade of grass, and after having made
another approach (to another blade), draws itself together
towards it, thus does this Self, after having
thrown off this body and dispelled all ignorance, and after
making another approach (to another body),
draw himself together towards it.
4-4:4. `And as a goldsmith, taking a piece of gold, turns it
into another, newer and more beautiful shape,
so does this Self, after having thrown off this body and
dispelled all ignorance, make unto himself
another, newer and more beautiful shape, whether it be
like the Fathers, or like the Gandharvas, or like
the Devas, or like Pragapati, or like Brahman, or like other
beings.
4-4:5. `That Self is indeed Brahman, consisting of
knowledge, mind, life, sight, hearing, earth, water,
wind, ether, light and no light, desire and no desire, anger
and no anger, right or wrong, and all things.
Now as a man is like this or like that, according as he acts
and according as he behaves, so will he be:
a man of good acts will become good, a man of bad acts,
bad. He becomes pure by pure deeds, bad by bad
deeds.
`And here they say that a person consists of desires. And
as is his desire, so is his will; and as is his will,
so is his deed; and whatever deed he does, that he will
reap.
4-4:6. `And here there is this verse: "To whatever object
a man's own mind is attached, to that he goes
strenuously together with his deed; and having obtained
the end (the last results) of whatever deed he does 
here on earth, he returns again from that world (which is
the temporary reward of his deed) to this world
of action."
`So much for the man who desires. But as to the man
who does not desire, who, not desiring, freed from
desires, is satisfied in his desires, or desires the Self only,
his vital spirits do not depart elsewhere,
being Brahman, he goes to Brahman.
4-4:7. `On this there is this verse: "When all desires
which once entered his heart are undone, then does
the mortal become immortal, then he obtains Brahman."
`And as the slough of a snake lies on an ant-hill, dead
and cast away, thus lies this body; but that
disembodied immortal spirit (prana, life) is Brahman only,
is only light.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `Sir, I give you a thousand.'
4-4:8. `On this there are these verses:
`The small, old path stretching far away has been found
by me. On it sages who know Brahman move on
to the Svarga-loka (heaven), and thence higher on, as
entirely free.
4-4:9. `On that path they say that there is white, or blue,
or yellow, or green, or red; that path was found
by Brahman, and on it goes whoever knows Brahman,
and who has done good, and obtained splendour.
4-4:10. `All who worship what is not knowledge (avidya)
enter into blind darkness: those who delight in
knowledge, enter, as it were, into greater darkness.
4-4:11. `There are indeed those unblessed worlds,
covered with blind darkness. Men who are ignorant
and not enlightened go after death to those worlds.
4-4:12. `If a man understands the Self, saying, "I am He,"
what could he wish or desire that he should
pine after the body.
4-4:13. `Whoever has found and understood the Self that
has entered into this patched-together hidingplace, he indeed is the creator, for he is the maker of
everything, his is the world, and he is the world
itself.
4-4:14. `While we are here, we may know this; if not, I
am ignorant, and there is great destruction.
Those who know it, become immortal, but others suffer
pain indeed.
4-4:15. `If a man clearly beholds this Self as God, and as
the lord of all that is and will be, then he is no
more afraid.
4-4:16. `He behind whom the year revolves with the
days, him the gods worship as the light of lights, as
immortal time.
4-4:17. `He in whom the five beings and the ether rest,
him alone I believe to be the Self, I who know,
believe him to be Brahman; I who am immortal, believe
him to be immortal.
4-4:18. `They who know the life of life, the eye of the eye,
the ear of the ear, the mind of the mind, they
have comprehended the ancient, primeval Brahman.
4-4:19. `By the mind alone it is to be perceived, there is
in it no diversity. He who perceives therein any
diversity, goes from death to death.
4-4:20. `This eternal being that can never be proved, is
to be perceived in one way only; it is spotless,
beyond the ether, the unborn Self, great and eternal.
4-4:21. `Let a wise Brahmana, after he has discovered
him, practise wisdom. Let him not seek after
many words, for that is mere weariness of the tongue.
4-4:22. `And he is that great unborn Self, who consists of
knowledge, is surrounded by the Pranas, the
ether within the heart. In it there reposes the ruler of all,
the lord of all, the king of all. He does not
become greater by good works, nor smaller by evil works.
He is the lord of all, the king of all things, the 
protector of all things. He is a bank and a boundary, so
that these worlds may not be confounded.
Brahmanas seek to know him by the study of the Veda,
by sacrifice, by gifts, by penance, by fasting, and
he who knows him, becomes a Muni. Wishing for that
world (for Brahman) only, mendicants leave their
homes.
`Knowing this, the people of old did not wish for offspring.
What shall we do with offspring, they said,
we who have this Self and this world (of Brahman)? And
they, having risen above the desire for sons,
wealth, and new worlds, wander about as mendicants.
For desire for sons is desire for wealth, and desire
for wealth is desire for worlds. Both these are indeed
desires only. He, the Self, is to be described by No,
no! He is incomprehensible, for he cannot be
comprehended; he is imperishable, for he cannot perish;
he
is unattached, for he does not attach himself; unfettered,
he does not suffer, he does not fail. Him (who
knows), these two do not overcome, whether he says that
for some reason he has done evil, or for some
reason he has done good he overcomes both, and
neither what he has done, nor what he has omitted to
do, burns (affects) him.
4-4:23. `This has been told by a verse (Rik): "This eternal
greatness of the Brahmana does not grow
larger by work, nor does it grow smaller. Let man try to
find (know) its trace, for having found (known)
it, he is not sullied by any evil deed."
`He therefore that knows it, after having become quiet,
subdued, satisfied, patient, and collected, sees self
in Self, sees all as Self. Evil does not overcome him, he
overcomes all evil. Evil does not burn him, he
burns all evil. Free from evil, free from spots, free from
doubt, he becomes a (true) Brahmana; this is the
Brahma-world, O King,' thus spoke Yagnavalkya.
Ganaka Vaideha said: `Sir, I give you the Videhas, and
also myself, to be together your slaves.'
4-4:24. This indeed is the great, the unborn Self, the
strong, the giver of wealth. He who knows this 
obtains wealth.
4-4:25. This great, unborn Self, undecaying, undying,
immortal, fearless, is indeed Brahman. Fearless is
Brahman, and he who knows this becomes verily the
fearless Brahman.
Section 5
Sixth Brahmana
4-5:1. Yagnavalkya had two wives, Maitreyi and
Katyayani. Of these Maitreyi was conversant with
Brahman, but Katyayani possessed such knowledge only
as women possess. And Yagnavalkya, when he
wished to get ready for another state of life (when he
wished to give up the state of a householder, and
retire into the forest),
4-5:2. Said, `Maitreyi, verily I am going away from this my
house (into the forest). Forsooth, let me
make a settlement between thee and that Katyayani.'
4-5:3. Maitreyi said: `My Lord, if this whole earth, full of
wealth, belonged to me, tell me, should I be
immortal by it, or no?'
`No,' replied Yagnavalkya, `like the life of rich people will
be thy life. But there is no hope of immortality
by wealth.'
4-5:4. And Maitreyi said: `What should I do with that by
which I do not become immortal? What my
Lord knoweth (of immortality), tell that clearly to me.'
4-5:5. Yagnavalkya replied: `Thou who art truly dear to
me, thou hast increased what is dear (to me in
thee). Therefore, if you like, Lady, I will explain it to thee,
and mark well what I say.'
4-5:6. And he said: `Verily, a husband is not dear, that
you may love the husband; but that you may love
the Self, therefore a husband is dear.
`Verily, a wife is not dear, that you may love the wife; but
that you may love the Self, therefore a wife is 
dear.
`Verily, sons are not dear, that you may love the sons; but
that you may love the Self, therefore sons are
dear.
`Verily, wealth is not dear, that you may love wealth; but
that you may love the Self, therefore wealth is
dear.
`Verily, cattle are not dear, that you may love cattle; but
that you may love the Self, therefore cattle are
dear.
`Verily, the Brahman-class is not dear, that you may love
the Brahman-class; but that you may love the
Self, therefore the Brahman-class is dear.
`Verily, the Kshatra-class is not dear, that you may love
the Kshatra-class; but that you may love the Self,
therefore the Kshatra-class is dear.
`Verily, the worlds are not dear, that you may love the
worlds; but that you may love the Self, therefore the
worlds are dear.
`Verily, the Devas are not dear, that you may love the
Devas; but that you may love the Self, therefore the
Devas are dear.
`Verily, the Vedas are not dear, that you may love the
Vedas; but that you may love the Self, therefore the
Vedas are dear.
`Verily, creatures are not dear, that you may love the
creatures; but that you may love the Self, therefore
are creatures dear.
`Verily, everything is not dear, that you may love
everything; but that you may love the Self, therefore
everything is dear.
`Verily, the Self is to be seen, to be heard, to be
perceived, to be marked, O Maitreyi! When the Self has
been seen, heard, perceived, and known, then all this is
known.' 
4-5:7. `Whosoever looks for the Brahman-class
elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the
Brahman-class. Whosoever looks for the Kshatra-class
elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the
Kshatra-class. Whosoever looks for the worlds elsewhere
than in the Self, was abandoned by the worlds.
Whosoever looks for the Devas elsewhere than in the
Self, was abandoned by the Devas. Whosoever looks
for the Vedas elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned
by the Vedas. Whosoever looks for the creatures
elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the
creatures. Whosoever looks for anything elsewhere than
in the Self, was abandoned by anything.
`This Brahman-class, this Kshatra-class, these worlds,
these Devas, these Vedas, all these beings, this
everything, all is that Self.
4-5:8. `Now as the sounds of a drum, when beaten,
cannot be seized externally (by themselves), but the
sound is seized, when the drum is seized, or the beater of
the drum;
4-5:9. `And as the sounds of a conch-shell, when blown,
cannot be seized externally (by themselves), but
the sound is seized, when the shell is seized, or the
blower of the shell;
4-5:10. `And as the sounds of a lute, when played,
cannot be seized externally (by themselves), but the
sound is seized, when the lute is seized, or the player of
the lute;
4-5:11. `As clouds of smoke proceed by themselves out
of lighted fire kindled with damp fuel, thus verily,
O Maitreyi, has been breathed forth from this great Being
what we have as Rig-veda, Yagur-veda, Samaveda, Atharvangirasas, Itihasa, Purana, Vidya, the
Upanishads, Slokas, Sutras, Anuvyakhyanas,
Vyakhyanas, what is sacrificed, what is poured out, food,
drink, this world and the other world, and all
creatures. From him alone all these were breathed forth.
4-5:12. `As all waters find their centre in the sea, all
touches in the skin, all tastes in the tongue, all 
smells in the nose, all colours in the eye, all sounds in the
ear, all percepts in the mind, all knowledge in
the heart, all actions in the hands, all movements in the
feet, and all the Vedas in speech,
4-5:13. `As a mass of salt has neither inside nor outside,
but is altogether a mass of taste, thus indeed has
that Self neither inside nor outside, but is altogether a
mass of knowledge; and having risen from out these
elements, vanishes again in them. When he has
departed, there is no more knowledge (name), I say, O
Maitreyi,' thus spoke Yagnavalkya.
4-5:14. Then Maitreyi said: `Here, Sir, thou hast landed
me in utter bewilderment. Indeed, I do not
understand him.'
But he replied: `O Maitreyi, I say nothing that is
bewildering. Verily, beloved, that Self is imperishable,
and of an indestructible nature.
4-5:15. `For when there is as it were duality, then one
sees the other, one smells the other, one tastes the
other, one salutes the other, one hears the other, one
perceives the other, one touches the other, one knows
the other; but when the Self only is all this, how should he
see another, how should he smell another, how
should he taste another, how should he salute another,
how should he hear another, how should he touch
another, how should he know another? How should he
know Him by whom he knows all this? That Self
is to be described by No, no! He is incomprehensible, for
he cannot be comprehended; he is imperishable,
for he cannot perish; he is unattached, for he does not
attach himself; unfettered, he does not suffer, he
does not fail. How, O beloved, should he know the
Knower? Thus, O Maitreyi, thou hast been instructed.
Thus far goes immortality.' Having said so, Yagnavalkya
went away (into the forest).

Adoration to Brahman.

~ Chapter 5 ~
Fifth Adhyaya
Section 1
First Brahmana
5-1:1. That (the invisible Brahman) is full, this (the visible
Brahman) is full. This full (visible Brahman) 
proceeds from that full (invisible Brahman). On grasping
the fulness of this full (visible Brahman) there
is left that full (invisible Brahman).
Om (is) ether, (is) Brahman. `There is the old ether (the
invisible), and the (visible) ether of the
atmosphere,' thus said Kauravyayaniputra. This (the Om)
is the Veda (the means of knowledge), thus the
Brahmanas know. One knows through it all that has to be
known.
Section 2
Second Brahmana
5-2:1. The threefold descendants of Pragapati, gods,
men, and Asuras (evil spirits), dwelt as
Brahmakarins (students) with their father Pragapati.
Having finished their studentship the gods said:
`Tell us (something), Sir.' He told them the syllable Da.
Then he said: `Did you understand?' They said:
`We did understand. You told us "Damyata," Be
subdued.' `Yes,' he said, `you have understood.'
5-2:2. Then the men said to him: `Tell us something, Sir.'
He told them the same syllable Da. Then he
said: `Did you understand?' They said: `We did
understand. You told us, "Datta," Give.' `Yes,' he said,
`you have understood.'
5-2:3. Then the Asuras said to him: `Tell us something,
Sir.' He told them the same syllable Da. Then
he said: `Did you understand?' They said: `We did
understand. You told us, "Dayadham," Be merciful.'
`Yes,' he said, `you have understood.'
The divine voice of thunder repeats the same, Da Da Da,
that is, Be subdued, Give, Be merciful.
Therefore let that triad be taught, Subduing, Giving, and
Mercy.
Section 3
Third Brahmana
5-3:1. Pragapati is the heart, is this Brahman, is all this.
The heart, hridaya, consists of three syllables.
One syllable is hri, and to him who knows this, his own
people and others bring offerings. One syllable is
da, and to him who knows this, his own people and others
bring gifts. One syllable is yam, and he who
knows this, goes to heaven (svarga) as his world.
Section 4
Fourth Brahmana
5-4:1. This (heart) indeed is even that, it was indeed the
true (Brahman). And whosoever knows this
great glorious first-born as the true Brahman, he
conquers these worlds, and conquered likewise may that
(enemy) be! yes, whosoever knows this great glorious
first-born as the true Brahman; for Brahman is the
true.
Section 5
Fifth Brahmana
5-5:1. In the beginning this (world) was water. Water
produced the true, and the true is Brahman.
Brahman produced Pragapati, Pragapati the Devas
(gods). The Devas adore the true (satyam) alone. This
satyam consists of three syllables. One syllable is sa,
another t(i), the third yam. The first and last
syllables are true, in the middle there is the untrue. This
untrue is on both sides enclosed by the true, and
thus the true preponderates. The untrue does not hurt
him who knows this.
5-5:2. Now what is the true, that is the Aditya (the sun),
the person that dwells in yonder orb, and the
person in the right eye. These two rest on each other, the
former resting with his rays in the latter, the
latter with his pranas (senses) in the former. When the
latter is on the point of departing this life, he sees
that orb as white only, and those rays (of the sun) do not
return to him.
5-5:3. Now of the person in that (solar) orb Bhuh is the
head, for the head is one, and that syllable is one; 
Bhuvah the two arms, for the arms are two, and these
syllables are two; Svar the foot, for the feet are two,
and these syllables are two. Its secret name is Ahar
(day), and he who knows this, destroys (hanti) evil
and leaves (gahati) it.
5-5:4. Of the person in the right eye Bhuh is the head, for
the head is one, and that syllable is one;
Bhuvah the two arms, for the arms are two, and these
syllables are two; Svar the foot, for the feet are two,
and these syllables are two. Its secret name is Aham
(ego), and he who knows this, destroys (hanti) evil
and leaves (gahati) it.
Section 6
Sixth Brahmana
5-6:1. That person, under the form of mind (manas),
being light indeed, is within the heart, small like a
grain of rice or barley. He is the ruler of all, the lord of all
he rules all this, whatsoever exists.
Section 7
Seventh Brahmana
5-7:1. They say that lightning is Brahman, because
lightning (vidyut) is called so from cutting off
(vidanat). Whosoever knows this, that lightning is
Brahman, him (that Brahman) cuts off from evil, for
lightning indeed is Brahman.
Section 8
Eighth Brahmana
5-8:1. Let him meditate on speech as a cow. Her four
udders are the words Svaha, Vashat, Hanta, and
Svadha. The gods live on two of her udders, the Svaha
and the Vashat, men on the Hanta, the fathers on
the Svadha. The bull of that cow is breath (prana), the
calf the mind.
Section 9 
Ninth Brahmana
5-9:1. Agni Vaisvanara is the fire within man by which the
food that is eaten is cooked, i.e. digested. Its
noise is that which one hears, if one covers one's ears.
When he is on the point of departing this life, he
does not hear that noise.
Section 10
Tenth Brahmana
5-10:1. When the person goes away from this world, he
comes to the wind. Then the wind makes room
for him, like the hole of a carriage wheel, and through it
he mounts higher. He comes to the sun. Then
the sun makes room for him, like the hole of a Lambara,
and through it he mounts higher. He comes to
the moon. Then the moon makes room for him, like the
hole of a drum, and through it he mounts higher,
and arrives at the world where there is no sorrow, no
snow. There he dwells eternal years.
Section 11
Eleventh Brahmana
5-11:1. This is indeed the highest penance, if a man, laid
up with sickness, suffers pain. He who knows
this, conquers the highest world.
This is indeed the highest penance, if they carry a dead
person into the forest. He who knows this,
conquers the highest world.
This is indeed the highest penance, if they place a dead
person on the fire. He who knows this, conquers
the highest world.
Section 12
Twelfth Brahmana
5-12:1. Some say that food is Brahman, but this is not
so, for food decays without life (prana). Others say 
that life (prana) is Brahman, but this is not so, for life dries
up without food. Then these two deities (food
and life), when they have become one, reach that highest
state (i.e. are Brahman). Thereupon Pratrida
said to his father: `Shall I be able to do any\ good to one
who knows this, or shall I be able to do him any
harm?' The father said to him, beckoning with his hand:
`Not so, O Pratrida; for who could reach the
highest state, if he has only got to the oneness of these
two?' He then said to him: `Vi; verily, food is Vi,
for all these beings rest (vishtani) on food.' He then said:
`Ram; verily, life is Ram, for all these beings
delight (ramante) in life. All beings rest on him, all beings
delight in him who knows this.'
Section 13
Thirteenth Brahmana
5-13:1. Next follows the Uktha. Verily, breath (prana) is
Uktha, for breath raises up (utthapayati) all
this. From him who knows this, there is raised a wise
son, knowing the Uktha; he obtains union and
oneness with the Uktha.
5-13:2. Next follows the Yagus. Verily, breath is Yagus,
for all these beings are joined in breath. For
him who knows this, all beings are joined to procure his
excellence; he obtains union and oneness with
the Yagus.
5-13:3. Next follows the Saman. Verily, breath is the
Saman, for all these beings meet in breath. For
him who knows this, all beings meet to procure his
excellence; he obtains union and oneness with the
Saman.
5-13:4. Next follows the Kshatra. Verily, breath is the
Kshatra, for breath is Kshatra, i.e. breath protects
(trayate) him from being hurt (kshanitoh). He who knows
this, obtains Kshatra (power), which requires
no protection; he obtains union and oneness with
Kshatra.
Section 14 
Fourteenth Brahmana
5-14:1. The words Bhumi (earth), Antariksha (sky), and
Dyu (heaven) form eight syllables. One foot of
the Gayatri consists of eight syllables. This (one foot) of it
is that (i.e. the three worlds). And he who
thus knows that foot of it, conquers as far as the three
worlds extend.
5-14:2. The Rikas, the Yagumshi, and the Samani form
eight syllables. One foot (the second) of the
Gayatri consists of eight syllables. This (one foot) of it is
that (i.e. the three Vedas, the Rig-veda, Yagurveda, and Sama-veda). And he who thus knows that foot
of it, conquers as far as that threefold knowledge
extends.
5-14:3. The Prana (the up-breathing), the Apana (the
down-breathing), and the Vyana (the backbreathing) form eight syllables. One foot (the third) of the
Gayatri consists of eight syllables. This (one
foot) of it is that (i.e. the three vital breaths). And he who
thus knows that foot of it, conquers as far as
there is anything that breathes. And of that (Gayatri, or
speech) this indeed is the fourth (turiya), the
bright (darsata) foot, shining high above the skies. What
is here called turiya (the fourth) is meant for
katurtha (the fourth); what is called darsatam padam (the
bright foot) is meant for him who is as it were
seen (the person in the sun); and what is called
paroragas (he who shines high above the skies) is meant
for him who shines higher and higher above every sky.
And he who thus knows that foot of the Gayatri,
shines thus himself also with happiness and glory.
5-14:4. That Gayatri (as described before with its three
feet) rests on that fourth foot, the bright one, high
above the sky. And that again rests on the True
(satyam), and the True is the eye, for the eye is (known to
be) true. And therefore even now, if two persons come
disputing, the one saying, I saw, the other, I heard,
then we should trust the one who says, I saw. And the
True again rests on force (balam), and force is life
(prana), and that (the True) rests on life. Therefore they
say, force is stronger than the True. Thus does 
that Gayatri rest with respect to the self (as life). That
Gayatri protects (tatre) the vital breaths (gayas);
the gayas are the pranas (vital breaths), and it protects
them. And because it protects (tatre) the vital
breaths (gayas), therefore it is called Gayatri. And that
Savitri verse which the teacher teaches, that is it
(the life, the prana, and indirectly the Gayatri); and
whomsoever he teaches, he protects his vital breaths.
5-14:5. Some teach that Savitri as an Anushtubh verse,
saying that speech is Anushtubh, and that we
teach that speech. Let no one do this, but let him teach
the Gayatri as Savitri. And even if one who
knows this receives what seems to be much as his
reward (as a teacher), yet this is not equal to one foot of
the Gayatri.
5-14:6. If a man (a teacher) were to receive as his fee
these three worlds full of all things, he would obtain
that first foot of the Gayatri. And if a man were to receive
as his fee everything as far as this threefold
knowledge extends, he would obtain that second foot of
the Gayatri. And if a man were to receive as his
fee everything whatsoever breathes, he would obtain that
third foot of the Gayatri. But `that fourth bright
foot, shining high above the skies', cannot be obtained by
anybody whence then could one receive such
a fee?
5-14:7. The adoration of that (Gayatri):
`O Gayatri, thou hast one foot, two feet, three feet, four
feet. Thou art footless, for thou art not known.
Worship to thy fourth bright foot above the skies.' If one
(who knows this) hates some one and says, `May
he not obtain this,' or `May this wish not be accomplished
to him,' then that wish is not accomplished to
him against whom he thus prays, or if he says, `May I
obtain this.'
5-14:8. And thus Ganaka Vaideha spoke on this point to
Budila Asvatarasvi: `How is it that thou who
spokest thus as knowing the Gayatri, hast become an
elephant and carriest me?' He answered: `Your
Majesty, I did not know its mouth. Agni, fire, is indeed its
mouth; and if people pile even what seems 
much (wood) on the fire, it consumes it all. And thus a
man who knows this, even if he commits what
seems much evil, consumes it all and becomes pure,
clean, and free from decay and death.'
Section 15
Fifteenth Brahmana
5-15:1. The face of the True (the Brahman) is covered
with a golden disk. Open that, O Pushan, that we
may see the nature of the True.
5-15:2. O Pushan, only seer, Yama (judge), Surya (sun),
son of Pragapati, spread thy rays and gather
them! The light which is thy fairest form, I see it. I am
what he is (viz. the person in the sun).
5-15:3. Breath to air and to the immortal! Then this my
body ends in ashes. Om! Mind, remember!
Remember thy deeds! Mind, remember! Remember thy
deeds!
5-15:4. Agni, lead us on to wealth (beatitude) by a good
path, thou, O God, who knowest all things!
Keep far from us crooked evil, and we shall offer thee the
fullest praise! (Rv. I, 189, 1.)

~ Chapter 6 ~
Sixth Adhyaya
Section 1
First Brahmana
6-1:1. Harih, Om. He who knows the first and the best,
becomes himself the first and the best among his
people. Breath is indeed the first and the best. He who
knows this, becomes the first and the best among
his people, and among whomsoever he wishes to be so.
6-1:2. He who knows the richest, becomes himself the
richest among his people. Speech is the richest. 
He who knows this, becomes the richest among his
people, and among whomsoever he wishes to be so.
6-1:3. He who knows the firm rest, becomes himself firm
on even and uneven ground. The eye indeed is
the firm rest, for by means of the eye a man stands firm
on even and uneven ground. He who knows this,
stands firm on even and uneven ground.
6-1:4. He who knows success, whatever desire he
desires, it succeeds to him. The ear indeed is success.
For in the ear are all these Vedas successful. He who
knows this, whatever desire he desires, it succeeds
to him.
6-1:5. He who knows the home, becomes a home of his
own people, a home of all men. The mind indeed
is the home. He who knows this, becomes a home of his
own people and a home of all men.
6-1:6. He who knows generation, becomes rich in
offspring and cattle. Seed indeed is generation. He
who knows this, becomes rich in offspring and cattle.
6-1:7. These Pranas (senses), when quarrelling together
as to who was the best, went to Brahman and
said: `Who is the richest of us?' He replied: `He by whose
departure this body seems worst, he is the
richest.'
6-1:8. The tongue (speech) departed, and having been
absent for a year, it came back and said: `How
have you been able to live without me?' They replied:
`Like unto people, not speaking with the tongue,
but breathing with breath, seeing with the eye, hearing
with the ear, knowing with the mind, generating
with seed. Thus we have lived.' Then speech entered in.
6-1:9. The eye (sight) departed, and having been absent
for a year, it came back and said: `How have you
been able to live without me?' They replied: `Like blind
people, not seeing with the eye, but breathing
with the breath, speaking with the tongue, hearing with
the ear, knowing with the mind, generating with
seed. Thus we have lived.' Then the eye entered in. 
6-1:10. The ear (hearing) departed, and having been
absent for a year, it came back and said: `How have
you been able to live without me?' They replied: `Like
deaf people, not hearing with the ear, but breathing
with the breath, speaking with the tongue, seeing with the
eye, knowing with the mind, generating with
seed. Thus we have lived.' Then the ear entered in.
6-1:11. The mind departed, and having been absent for a
year, it came back and said: `How have you
been able to live without me?' They replied: `Like fools,
not knowing with their mind, but breathing with
the breath, seeing with the eye, hearing with the ear,
generating with seed. Thus we have lived.' Then the
mind entered in.
6-1:12. The seed departed, and having been absent for a
year, it came back and said: `How have you been
able to live without me?' They replied: `Like impotent
people, not generating with seed, but breathing
with the breath, seeing with the eye, hearing with the ear,
knowing with the mind. Thus we have lived.'
Then the seed entered in.
6-1:13. The (vital) breath, when on the point of departing,
tore up these senses, as a great, excellent horse
of the Sindhu country might tare up the pegs to which he
is tethered. They said to him: `Sir, do not
depart. We shall not be able to live without thee.' He
said: `Then make me an offering.' They said: `Let
it be so.'
6-1:14. Then the tongue said: `If I am the richest, then
thou art the richest by it.' The eye said: `If I am
the firm rest, then thou art possessed of firm rest by it.'
The ear said: `If I am success, then thou art
possessed of success by it.' The mind said: `If I am the
home, thou art the home by it.' The seed said: `If I
am generation, thou art possessed of generation by it.'
He said: `What shall be food, what shall be dress
for me?'
They replied: `Whatever there is, even unto dogs, worms,
insects, and birds, that is thy food, and water thy
dress. He who thus knows the food of Ana (the breath),
by him nothing is eaten that is not (proper) food, 
nothing is received that is not (proper) food. Srotriyas
(Vedic theologians) who know this, rinse the
mouth with water when they are going to eat, and rinse
the mouth with water after they have eaten,
thinking that thereby they make the breath dressed (with
water).'
Section 2
Second Brahmana
6-2:1. Svetaketu Aruneya went to the settlement of the
Pankalas. He came near to Pravahana Gaivali,
who was walking about (surrounded by his men). As
soon as he (the king) saw him, he said: `My boy!'
Svetaketu replied: `Sir!'
Then the king said: `Have you been taught by your
father!' `Yes,' he replied.
6-2:2. The king said: `Do you know how men, when they
depart from here, separate from each other?'
`No,' he replied.
how they come back to this world?' `No,' he replied.
`Do you know how that world does never become full with
the many who again and again depart thither?'
`No,' he replied.
`Do you know at the offering of which libation the waters
become endowed with a human voice and rise
and speak?' `No,' he replied.
`Do you know the access to the path leading to the Devas
and to the path leading to the Fathers, i.e. by
what deeds men gain access to the path leading to the
Devas or to that leading to the Fathers? For we
have heard even the saying of a Rishi: "I heard of two
paths for men, one leading to the Fathers, the other
leading to the Devas. On those paths all that lives moves
on, whatever there is between father (sky) and
mother (earth)."'
Svetaketu said: `I do not know even one of all these
questions.' 
6-2:3. Then the king invited him to stay and accept his
hospitality. But the boy, not caring for
hospitality, ran away, went back to his father, and said:
`Thus then you called me formerly wellinstructed!' The father said: `What then, you sage?' The
son replied: `That fellow of a Raganya asked me
five questions, and I did not know one of them.'
`What were they?' said the father.
`These were they,' the son replied, mentioning the
different heads.
6-2:4. The father said: `You know me, child, that
whatever I know, I told you. But come, we shall go
thither, and dwell there as students.'
`You may go, Sir,' the son replied.
Then Gautama went where (the place of) Pravahana
Gaivali was, and the king offered him a seat, ordered
water for him, and gave him the proper offerings. Then
he said to him: `Sir, we offer a boon to Gautama.'
6-2:5. Gautama said: `That boon is promised to me; tell
me the same speech which you made in the
presence of my boy.'
6-2:6. He said: `That belongs to divine boons, name one
of the human boons.'
6-2:7. He said: `You know well that I have plenty of gold,
plenty of cows, horses, slaves, attendants, and
apparel; do not heap on me what I have already in plenty,
in abundance, and superabundance.'
The king said: `Gautama, do you wish (for instruction from
me) in the proper way?'
Gautama replied: `I come to you as a pupil.'
In word only have former sages (though Brahmans) come
as pupils (to people of lower rank), but
Gautama actually dwelt as a pupil (of Pravahana, who
was a Raganya) in order to obtain the fame of 
having respectfully served his master.
6-2:8. The king said: `Do not be offended with us, neither
you nor your forefathers, because this
knowledge has before now never dwelt with any
Brahmana. But I shall tell it to you, for who could refuse
you when you speak thus?
6-2:9. `The altar (fire), O Gautama, is that world
(heaven); the fuel is the sun itself, the smoke his rays,
the light the day, the coals the quarters, the sparks the
intermediate quarters. On that altar the Devas offer
the sraddha libation (consisting of water). From that
oblation rises Soma, the king (the moon).
6-2:10. `The altar, O Gautama, is Parganya (the god of
rain); the fuel is the year itself, the smoke the
clouds, the light the lightning, the coals the thunderbolt,
the sparks the thunderings. On that altar the
Devas offer Soma, the king (the moon). From that
oblation rises rain.
6-2:11. `The altar, O Gautama, is this world; the fuel is
the earth itself, the smoke the fire, the light the
night, the coals the moon, the sparks the stars. On that
altar the Devas offer rain. From that oblation
rises food.
6-2:12. `The altar, O Gautama, is man; the fuel the
opened mouth, the smoke the breath, the light the
tongue, the coals the eye, the sparks the ear. On that
altar the Devas offer food. From that oblation rises
seed.
6-2:13. `The altar, O Gautama, is woman. On that altar
the Devas offer seed. From that oblation rises
man. He lives so long as he lives, and then when he
dies,
6-2:14. `They take him to the fire (the funeral pile), and
then the altar-fire is indeed fire, the fuel fuel, the
smoke smoke, the light light, the coals coals, the sparks
sparks. In that very altar-fire the Devas offer
man, and from that oblation man rises, brilliant in colour.
6-2:15. `Those who thus know this (even Grihasthas),
and those who in the forest worship faith and the
True (Brahman Hiranyagarbha), go to light (arkis), from
light to day, from day to the increasing half,
from the increasing half to the six months when the sun
goes to the north, from those six months to the
world of the Devas (Devaloka), from the world of the
Devas to the sun, from the sun to the place of
lightning. When they have thus reached the place of
lightning a spirit comes near them, and leads them
to the worlds of the (conditioned) Brahman. In these
worlds of Brahman they dwell exalted for ages.
There is no returning for them.
6-2:16. `But they who conquer the worlds (future states)
by means of sacrifice, charity, and austerity, go
to smoke, from smoke to night, from night to the
decreasing half of the moon, from the decreasing half of
the moon to the six months when the sun goes to the
south, from these months to the world of the fathers,
from the world of the fathers to the moon. Having
reached the moon, they become food, and then the
Devas feed on them there, as sacrificers feed on Soma,
as it increases and decreases. But when this (the
result of their good works on earth) ceases, they return
again to that ether, from ether to the air, from the
air to rain, from rain to the earth. And when they have
reached the earth, they become food, they are
offered again in the altar-fire, which is man (see 11),
and thence are born in the fire of woman. Thus
they rise up towards the worlds, and go the same round
as before.
`Those, however, who know neither of these two paths,
become worms, birds, and creeping things.'
Section 3
Third Brahmana
6-3:1. If a man wishes to reach greatness (wealth for
performing sacrifices), he performs the upasad rule
during twelve days (i.e. he lives on small quantities of
milk), beginning on an auspicious day of the light
half of the moon during the northern progress of the sun,
collecting at the same time in a cup or a dish 
made of Udumbara wood all sorts of herbs, including
fruits. He sweeps the floor (near the house-altar,
avasathya), sprinkles it, lays the fire, spreads grass round
it according to rule, prepares the clarified butter
(agya), and on a day, presided over by a male star
(nakshatra), after having properly mixed the Mantha
(the herbs, fruits, milk, honey, &c.), he sacrifices (he
pours agya into the fire), saying: `O Gatavedas,
whatever adverse gods there are in thee, who defeat the
desires of men, to them I offer this portion; may
they, being pleased, please me with all desires.' Svaha!
`That cross deity who lies down, thinking that all things
are kept asunder by her, I worship thee as
propitious with this stream of ghee.' Svaha!
6-3:2. He then says, Svaha to the First, Svaha to the
Best, pours ghee into the fire, and throws what
remains into the Mantha (mortar).
He then says, Svaha to Breath, Svaha to her who is the
richest, pours ghee into the fire, and throws what
remains into the Mantha (mortar).
He then says, Svaha to Speech, Svaha to the Support,
pours ghee into the fire, and throws what remains
into the Mantha (mortar).
He then says, Svaha to the Eye, Svaha to Success, pours
ghee into the fire, and throws what remains into
the Mantha (mortar).
He then says, Svaha to the Ear, Svaha to the Home,
pours ghee into the fire, and throws what remains into
the Mantha (mortar).
He then says, Svaha to the Mind, Svaha to Offspring,
pours ghee into the fire, and throws what remains
into the Mantha (mortar).
He then says, Svaha to Seed, pours ghee into the fire,
and throws what remains into the Mantha (mortar).
6-3:3. He then says, Svaha to Agni (fire), pours ghee into
the fire, and throws what remains into the
Mantha (mortar). 
He then says, Svaha to Soma, pours ghee into the fire,
and throws what remains into the Mantha (mortar).
He then says, Bhuh (earth), Svaha, pours ghee into the
fire, and throws what remains into the Mantha
(mortar).
He then says, Bhuvah (sky), Svaha, pours ghee into the
fire, and throws what remains into the Mantha
(mortar).
He then says, Svah (heaven), Svaha, pours ghee into the
fire, and throws what remains into the Mantha
(mortar).
He then says, Bhur, Bhuvah, Svah, Svaha, pours ghee
into the fire, and throws what remains into the
Mantha (mortar).
He then says, Svaha to Brahman (the priesthood), pours
ghee into the fire, and throws what remains into
the Mantha (mortar).
He then says, Svaha to Kshatra (the knighthood), pours
ghee into the fire, and throws what remains into
the Mantha (mortar).
He then says, Svaha to the Past, pours ghee into the fire,
and throws what remains into the Mantha
(mortar).
He then says, Svaha to the Future, pours ghee into the
fire, and throws what remains into the Mantha
(mortar).
He then says, Svaha, to the Universe, pours ghee into the
fire, and throws what remains into the Mantha
(mortar).
He then says, Svaha to all things, pours ghee into the fire,
and throws what remains into the Mantha
(mortar).
He then says, Svaha to Pragapati, pours ghee into the
fire, and throws what remains into the Mantha 
(mortar).
6-3:4. Then he touches it (the Mantha, which is
dedicated to Prana, breath), saying: `Thou art fleet (as
breath). Thou art burning (as fire). Thou art full (as
Brahman). Thou art firm (as the sky). Thou art the
abode of all (as the earth). Thou hast been saluted with
Hin (at the beginning of the sacrifice by the
prastotri). Thou art saluted with Hin (in the middle of the
sacrifice by the prastotri). Thou hast been sung
(by the udgatri at the beginning of the sacrifice). Thou art
sung (by the udgatri in the middle of the
sacrifice). Thou hast been celebrated (by the adhvaryu at
the beginning of the sacrifice). Thou art
celebrated again (by the agnidhra in the middle of the
sacrifice). Thou art bright in the wet (cloud). Thou
art great. Thou art powerful. Thou art food (as Soma).
Thou art light (as Agni, fire, the eater). Thou art
the end. Thou art the absorption (of all things).'
6-3:5. Then he holds it (the Mantha) forth, saying: `Thou
knowest all, we know thy greatness. He is
indeed a king, a ruler, the highest lord. May that king,
that ruler make me the highest lord.'
6-3:6. Then he eats it, saying: `Tat savitur varenyam (We
meditate on that adorable light) The winds
drop honey for the righteous, the rivers drop honey, may
our plants be sweet as honey! Bhuh (earth)
Svaha!
`Bhargo devasya dhimahi (of the divine Savitri) May the
night be honey in the morning, may the air
above the earth, may heaven, our father, be honey!
Bhuvah (sky) Svaha!
`Dhiyo yo nah prokodayat (who should rouse our
thoughts) May the tree be full of honey, may the sun
be full of honey, may our cows be sweet like honey!
Svah (heaven) Svaha!'
He repeats the whole Savitri verse, and all the verses
about the honey, thinking, May I be all this! Bhur,
Bhuvah, Svah, Svaha! Having thus swallowed all, he
washes his hands, and sits down behind the altar, 
turning his head to the East. In the morning he worships
Aditya (the sun), with the hymn, `Thou art the
best lotus of the four quarters, may I become the best
lotus among men.' Then returning as he came, he
sits down behind the altar and recites the genealogical
list.
6-3:7. Uddalaka Aruni told this (Mantha-doctrine) to his
pupil Vagasaneya Yagnavalkya, and said: `If a
man were to pour it on a dry stick, branches would grow,
and leaves spring forth.'
6-3:8. Vagasaneya Yagnavalkya told the same to his
pupil Madhuka Paingya, and said: `If a man were to
pour it on a dry stick, branches would grow, and leaves
spring forth.'
6-3:9. Madhuka Paingya told the same to his pupil Kula
Bhagavitti, and said: `If a man were to pour it on
a dry stick, branches would grow, and leaves spring forth.'
6-3:10. Kula Bhagavitti told the same to his pupil Ganaki
Ayasthuna, and said: `If a man were to pour it
on a dry stick, branches would grow, and leaves spring
forth.'
6-3:11. Ganaki Ayasthuna told the same to his pupil
Satyakama Gabala, and said: `If a man were to pour
it on a dry stick, branches would grow, and leaves spring
forth.'
6-3:12. Satyakama Gabala told the same to his pupils,
and said: `If a man were to pour it on a dry stick,
branches would grow, and leaves spring forth.'
Let no one tell this to any one, except to a son or to a
pupil.
6-3:13. Four things are made of the wood of the
Udumbara tree, the sacrificial ladle (sruva), the cup
(kamasa), the fuel, and the two churning sticks.
There are ten kinds of village (cultivated) seeds, viz. rice
and barley (brihiyavas), sesamum and kidney-
beans (tilamashas), millet and panic seed
(anupriyangavas), wheat (godhumas), lentils (masuras),
pulse
(khalvas), and vetches (khalakulas). After having ground
these he sprinkles them with curds (dadhi),
honey, and ghee, and then offers (the proper portions) of
clarified butter (agya).
Section 4
Fourth Brahmana
6-4:1. The earth is the essence of all these things, water
is the essence of the earth, plants of water,
flowers of plants, fruits of flowers, man of fruits, seed of
man.
6-4:2. And Pragapati thought, let me make an abode for
him, and he created a woman (Satarupa).
Tam srishtvadha upasta, tasmat striyam adha upasita.
Sa etam prankam gravanam atmana eva
samudaparayat, tenainam abhyasrigat.
6-4:3. Tasya vedir upastho, lomani barhis,

6-4:4. Etad dha sma vai tadvidvan Uddalaka Arunir

6-4:6. If a man see himself in the water, he should recite
the following verse: `May there be in me
splendour, strength, glory, wealth, virtue.'
She is the best of women whose garments are pure.
Therefore let him approach a woman whose garments
are pure, and whose fame is pure, and address her.
6-4:7. If she do not give in, let him, as he likes, bribe her
(with presents). And if she then do not give in,
let him, as he likes, beat her with a stick or with his hand,
and overcome her, saying: `With manly
strength and glory I take away thy glory,' and thus she
becomes unglorious.
6-4:8. If she give in, he says: `With manly strength and
glory I give thee glory,' and thus they both
become glorious.
6-4:9. Sa yam ikkhet kamayeta meti tasyam artham
nishtaya mukhena mukham sandhayopastham asya
abhimrisya gaped angadangat sambhavasi hridayad adhi
gayase, sa tvam angakashayo 'si digdhaviddham
iva madayemam amum mayiti.
6-4:10. Atha yam ikkhen na garbham dadhiteti tasyam
artham nishtaya mukhena mukham
sandhayabhipranyapanyad indriyena te retasa reta adada
ity areta eva bhavati.
6-4:11. Atha yam ikkhed garbham dadhiteti tasyam
artham nishtaya mukhena mukham
sandhayapanyabhipranyad indriyena te retasa reta
adadhamiti garbhiny eva bhavati.
6-4:12. Now again, if a man's wife has a lover and the
husband hates him, let him (according to rule)
place fire by an unbaked jar, spread a layer of arrows in
inverse order, anoint these three arrow-heads with
butter in inverse order, and sacrifice, saying: `Thou hast
sacrificed in my fire, I take away thy up and 
down breathing, I here.'
`Thou hast sacrificed in my fire, I take away thy sons and
cattle, I here.'
`Thou hast sacrificed in my fire, I take away thy sacred
and thy good works, I here.'
`Thou hast sacrificed in my fire, I take away thy hope and
expectation, I here.'
He whom a Brahmana who knows this curses, departs
from this world without strength and without good
works. Therefore let no one wish even for sport with the
wife of a Srotriya who knows this, for he who
knows this, is a dangerous enemy.
6-4:13. When the monthly illness seizes his wife, she
should for three days not drink from a metal vessel,
and wear a fresh dress. Let no Vrishala or Vrishali (a
Sudra man or woman) touch her. At the end of the
three days, when she has bathed, the husband should
make her pound rice.
6-4:14. And if a man wishes that a white son should be
born to him, and that he should know one Veda,
and live to his full age, then, after having prepared boiled
rice with milk and butter, they should both eat,
being fit to have offspring.
6-4:15. And if a man wishes that a reddish son with
tawny eyes should be born to him, and that he should
know two Vedas, and live to his full age, then, after
having prepared boiled rice with coagulated milk and
butter, they should both eat, being fit to have offspring.
6-4:16. And if a man wishes that a dark son should be
born to him with red eyes, and that he should
know three Vedas, and live to his full age, then, after
having prepared boiled rice with water and butter,
they should both eat, being fit to have offspring.
6-4:17. And if a man wishes that a learned daughter
should be born to him, and that she should live to
her full age, then, after having prepared boiled rice with
sesamum and butter, they should both eat, being 
fit to have offspring.
6-4:18. And if a man wishes that a learned son should be
born to him, famous, a public man, a popular
speaker, that he should know all the Vedas, and that he
should live to his full age, then, after having
prepared boiled rice with meat and butter, they should
both eat, being fit to have offspring. The meat
should be of a young or of an old bull.
6-4:19. And then toward morning, after having, according
to the rule of the Sthalipaka (pot-boiling),
performed the preparation of the Agya (clarified butter),
he sacrifices from the Sthalipaka bit by bit,
saying: `This is for Agni, Svaha! This is for Anumati,
Svaha! This is for the divine Savitri, the true
creator, Svaha!' Having sacrificed, he takes out the rest
of the rice and eats it, and after having eaten, he
gives it to his wife. Then he washes his hands, fills a
water-jar, and sprinkles her thrice with it, saying:
`Rise hence, O Visvavasu, seek another blooming girl, a
wife with her husband.'
6-4:20. Then he embraces her, and says: `I am Ama
(breath), thou art Sa (speech). Thou art Sa (speech),
I am Ama (breath). I am the Saman, thou art the Rik. I
am the sky, thou art the earth. Come, let us
strive together, that a male child may be begotten.'
6-4:21. Athasya uru vihapayati, vigihitham dyavaprithivi
iti tasyam artham nishtaya mukhena mukham
sandhaya trir enam anulomam anumarshti, Vishnur yonim
kalpayatu, Tvashta rupani pimsatu, asinkatu
Pragapatir Dhata garbham dadhatu te. Garbham dhehi
Sinivali, garbham dhehi prithushtuke, garbham te
Asvinau devav adhattam pushkarasragau.
6-4:22. Hiranmayi arani yabhyam nirmanthatam asvinau,
tam te garbham havamahe dasame masi sutave.
Yathagnigarbha prithivi, yatha dyaur indrena garbhini,
vayur disam yatha garbha evam garbham dadhami

6-4:23. Soshyantim adbhir abhyukshati. Yatha vayuh
pushkarinim samingayati sarvatah, eva te garbha 
egatu sahavaitu garayuna. Indrasyayam vragah kritah
sargalah saparisrayah, tam indra nirgahi garbhena
savaram saheti.
6-4:24. When the child is born, he prepares the fire,
places the child on his lap, and having poured
prishadagya, i.e. dadhi (thick milk) mixed with ghrita
(clarified butter) into a metal jug, he sacrifices bit
by bit of that prishadagya, saying: `May I, as I increase in
this my house, nourish a thousand! May
fortune never fail in his race, with offspring and cattle,
Svaha!'
`I offer to thee in my mind the vital breaths which are in
me, Svaha!'
`Whatever in my work I have done too much, or whatever
I have here done too little, may the wise Agni
Svishtakrit make this right and proper for us, Svaha!'
6-4:25. Then putting his mouth near the child's right ear,
he says thrice, Speech, speech! After that he
pours together thick milk, honey, and clarified butter, and
feeds the child with (a ladle of) pure gold,
saying: `I give thee Bhuh, I give thee Bhuvah, I give thee
Svah. Bhur, Bhuvah, Svah, I give thee all.'
6-4:26. Then he gives him his name, saying: `Thou art
Veda;' but this is his secret name.
6-4:27. Then he hands the boy to his mother and gives
him her breast, saying: `O Sarasvati, that breast of
thine which is inexhaustible, delightful, abundant, wealthy,
generous, by which thou cherishest all
blessings, make that to flow here.'
6-4:28. Then he addresses the mother of the boy: `Thou
art Ila Maitravaruni: thou strong woman hast
born a strong boy. Be thou blessed with strong children
thou who hast blessed me with a strong child.'
And they say of such a boy: `Ah, thou art better than thy
father; ah, thou art better than thy grandfather.
Truly he has reached the highest point in happiness,
praise, and Vedic glory who is born as the son of a
Brahmana that knows this.'
