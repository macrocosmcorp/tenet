~ Chapter 1 ~
First Adhyaya
1:1. The Brahma-students say: Is Brahman the cause?
Whence are we born? Whereby do we live, and
whither do we go? O ye who know Brahman, (tell us) at
whose command we abide, whether in pain or in
pleasure?
1:2. Should time, or nature, or necessity, or chance, or
the elements be considered as the cause, or he who
is called the person (purusha, vignanatma)? It cannot be
their union either, because that is not selfdependent, and the self also is powerless, because there
is (independent of him) a cause of good and evil.
1:3. The sages, devoted to meditation and concentration,
have seen the power belonging to God himself,
hidden in its own qualities (guna). He, being one,
superintends all those causes, time, self, and the rest.
1:4. We meditate on him who (like a wheel) has one felly
with three tires, sixteen ends, fifty spokes, with 
twenty counter-spokes, and six sets of eight; whose one
rope is manifold, who proceeds on three different
roads, and whose illusion arises from two causes.
1:5. We meditate on the river whose water consists of the
five streams, which is wild and winding with its
five springs, whose waves are the five vital breaths,
whose fountain head is the mind, the course of the
five kinds of perceptions. It has five whirlpools, its rapids
are the five pains; it has fifty kinds of suffering,
and five branches.
1:6. In that vast Brahma-wheel, in which all things live
and rest, the bird flutters about, so long as he
thinks that the self (in him) is different from the mover (the
god, the lord). When he has been blessed by
him, then he gains immortality.
1:7. But what is praised (in the Upanishads) is the
Highest Brahman, and in it there is the triad. The
Highest Brahman is the safe support, it is imperishable.
The Brahma-students, when they have known
what is within this (world), are devoted and merged in the
Brahman, free from birth.
1:8. The Lord (isa) supports all this together, the
perishable and the imperishable, the developed and the
undeveloped. The (living) self, not being a lord, is bound,
because he has to enjoy (the fruits of works);
but when he has known the god (deva), he is freed from
all fetters.
1:9. There are two, one knowing (isvara), the other notknowing (giva), both unborn, one strong, the
other weak; there is she, the unborn, through whom each
man receives the recompense of his works; and
there is the infinite Self (appearing) under all forms, but
himself inactive. When a man finds out these
three, that is Brahma.
1:10. That which is perishable is the Pradhana (the first),
the immortal and imperishable is Hara. The
one god rules the perishable (the pradhana) and the
(living) self. From meditating on him, from joining
him, from becoming one with him there is further
cessation of all illusion in the end. 
1:11. When that god is known, all fetters fall off,
sufferings are destroyed, and birth and death cease.
From meditating on him there arises, on the dissolution of
the body, the third state, that of universal
lordship; but he only who is alone, is satisfied.
1:12. This, which rests eternally within the self, should be
known; and beyond this not anything has to be
known. By knowing the enjoyer, the enjoyed, and the
ruler, everything has been declared to be threefold,
and this is Brahman.
1:13. As the form of fire, while it exists in the under-wood,
is not seen, nor is its seed destroyed, but it has
to be seized again and again by means of the stick and
the under-wood, so it is in both cases, and the Self
has to be seized in the body by means of the pranava
(the syllable Om).
1:14. By making his body the under-wood, and the
syllable Om the upper-wood, man, after repeating the
drill of meditation, will perceive the bright god, like the
spark hidden in the wood.
1:15. As oil in seeds, as butter in cream, as water in (dry)
river-beds, as fire in wood, so is the Self seized
within the self, if man looks for him by truthfulness and
penance;
1:16. (If he looks) for the Self that pervades everything,
as butter is contained in milk, and the roots
whereof are self-knowledge and penance. That is the
Brahman taught by the Upanishad.

~ Chapter 2 ~
Second Adhyaya
2:1. Savitri (the sun), having first collected his mind and
expanded his thoughts, brought Agni (fire),
when he had discovered his light, above the earth.
2:2. With collected minds we are at the command of the
divine Savitri, that we may obtain blessedness.
2:3. May Savitri, after he has reached with his mind the
gods as they rise up to the sky, and with his
thoughts (has reached) heaven, grant these gods to
make a great light to shine.
2:4. The wise sages of the great sage collect their mind
and collect their thoughts. He who alone knows
the law (Savitri) has ordered the invocations; great is the
praise of the divine Savitri.
2:5. Your old prayer has to be joined with praises. Let
my song go forth like the path of the sun! May all
the sons of the Immortal listen, they who have reached
their heavenly homes.
2:6. Where the fire is rubbed, where the wind is checked,
where the Soma flows over, there the mind is
born.
2:7. Let us love the old Brahman by the grace of Savitri;
if thou make thy dwelling there, the path will
not hurt thee.
2:8. If a wise man hold his body with its three erect parts
(chest, neck, and head) even, and turn his
senses with the mind towards the heart, he will then in the
boat of Brahman cross all the torrents which
cause fear.
2:9. Compressing his breathings let him, who has
subdued all motions, breathe forth through the nose
with gentle breath. Let the wise man without fail restrain
his mind, that chariot yoked with vicious
horses.
2:10. Let him perform his exercises in a place level, pure,
free from pebbles, fire, and dust, delightful by
its sounds, its water, and bowers, not painful to the eye,
and full of shelters and caves.
2:11. When Yoga is being performed, the forms which
come first, producing apparitions in Brahman, are 
those of misty smoke, sun, fire, wind, fire-flies, lightnings,
and a crystal moon.
2:12. When, as earth, water, light, heat, and ether arise,
the fivefold quality of Yoga takes place, then
there is no longer illness, old age, or pain for him who has
obtained a body, produced by the fire of Yoga.
2:13. The first results of Yoga they call lightness,
healthiness, steadiness, a good complexion, an easy
pronunciation, a sweet odour, and slight excretions.
2:14. As a metal disk (mirror), tarnished by dust, shines
bright again after it has been cleaned, so is the
one incarnate person satisfied and free from grief, after
he has seen the real nature of the self.
2:15. And when by means of the real nature of his self he
sees, as by a lamp, the real nature of Brahman,
then having known the unborn, eternal god, who is
beyond all natures, he is freed from all fetters.
2:16. He indeed is the god who pervades all regions: he
is the first-born (as Hiranyagarbha), and he is in
the womb. He has been born, and he will be born. He
stands behind all persons, looking everywhere.
2:17. The god who is in the fire, the god who is in the
water, the god who has entered into the whole
world, the god who is in plants, the god who is in trees,
adoration be to that god, adoration!

~ Chapter 3 ~
Third Adhyaya
3:1. The snarer who rules alone by his powers, who rules
all the worlds by his powers, who is one and the
same, while things arise and exist, they who know this
are immortal.
3:2. For there is one Rudra only, they do not allow a
second, who rules all the worlds by his powers. He 
stands behind all persons, and after having created all
worlds he, the protector, rolls it up at the end of
time.
3:3. That one god, having his eyes, his face, his arms,
and his feet in every place, when producing heaven
and earth, forges them together with his arms and his
wings.
3:4. He, the creator and supporter of the gods, Rudra,
the great seer, the lord of all, he who formerly gave
birth to Hiranyagarbha, may he endow us with good
thoughts.
3:5. O Rudra, thou dweller in the mountains, look upon
us with that most blessed form of thine which is
auspicious, not terrible, and reveals no evil!
3:6. O lord of the mountains, make lucky that arrow
which thou, a dweller in the mountains, holdest in
thy hand to shoot. Do not hurt man or beast!
3:7. Those who know beyond this the High Brahman, the
vast, hidden in the bodies of all creatures, and
alone enveloping everything, as the Lord, they become
immortal.
3:8. I know that great person (purusha) of sunlike lustre
beyond the darkness. A man who knows him
truly, passes over death; there is no other path to go.
3:9. This whole universe is filled by this person
(purusha), to whom there is nothing superior, from whom
there is nothing different, than whom there is nothing
smaller or larger, who stands alone, fixed like a tree
in the sky.
3:10. That which is beyond this world is without form and
without suffering. They who know it, become
immortal, but others suffer pain indeed.
3:11. That Bhagavat exists in the faces, the heads, the
necks of all, he dwells in the cave (of the heart) of
all beings, he is all-pervading, therefore he is the
omnipresent Siva. 
3:12. That person (purusha) is the great lord; he is the
mover of existence, he possesses that purest power
of reaching everything, he is light, he is undecaying.
3:13. The person (purusha), not larger than a thumb,
dwelling within, always dwelling in the heart of
man, is perceived by the heart, the thought, the mind:
they who know it become immortal.
3:14. The person (purusha) with a thousand heads, a
thousand eyes, a thousand feet, having compassed
the earth on every side, extends beyond it by ten fingers'
breadth.
3:15. That person alone (purusba) is all this, what has
been and what will be; he is also the lord of
immortality; he is whatever grows by food.
3:16. Its hands and feet are everywhere, its eyes and
head are everywhere, its ears are everywhere, it
stands encompassing all in the world.
3:17. Separate from all the senses, yet reflecting the
qualities of all the senses, it is the lord and ruler of
all, it is the great refuge of all.
3:18. The embodied spirit within the town with nine
gates, the bird, flutters outwards, the ruler of the
whole world, of all that rests and of all that moves.
3:19. Grasping without hands, hasting without feet, he
sees without eyes, he hears without ears. He
knows what can be known, but no one knows him; they
call him the first, the great person (purusha).
3:20. The Self, smaller than small, greater than great, is
hidden in the heart of the creature. A man who
has left all grief behind, sees the majesty, the Lord, the
passionless, by the grace of the creator (the Lord).
3:21. I know this undecaying, ancient one, the self of all
things, being infinite and omnipresent. They
declare that in him all birth is stopped, for the Brahmastudents proclaim him to be eternal.

~ Chapter 4 ~
Fourth Adhyaya
4:1. He, the sun, without any colour, who with set
purpose by means of his power (sakti) produces endless
colours, in whom all this comes together in the beginning,
and comes asunder in the end may he, the
god, endow us with good thoughts.
4:2. That (Self) indeed is Agni (fire), it is Aditya (sun), it is
Vayu (wind), it is Kandramas (moon); the
same also is the starry firmament, it is Brahman
(Hiranyagarbha), it is water, it is Pragapati (Virag).
4:3. Thou art woman, thou art man; thou art youth, thou
art maiden; thou, as an old man, totterest along
on thy staff; thou art born with thy face turned
everywhere.
4:4. Thou art the dark-blue bee, thou art the green parrot
with red eyes, thou art the thunder-cloud, the
seasons, the seas. Thou art without beginning, because
thou art infinite, thou from whom all worlds are
born.
4:5. There is one unborn being (female), red, white, and
black, uniform, but producing manifold
offspring. There is one unborn being (male) who loves
her and lies by her; there is another who leaves
her, while she is eating what has to be eaten.
4:6. Two birds, inseparable friends, cling to the same
tree. One of them eats the sweet fruit, the other
looks on without eating.
4:7. On the same tree man sits grieving, immersed,
bewildered, by his own impotence (an-isa). But when
he sees the other lord (isa) contented, and knows his
glory, then his grief passes away.
4:8. He who does not know that indestructible being of
the Rig-veda, that highest ether-like (Self)
wherein all the gods reside, of what use is the Rig-veda to
him? Those only who know it, rest contented. 
4:9. That from which the maker (mayin) sends forth all
this the sacred verses, the offerings, the
sacrifices, the panaceas, the past, the future, and all that
the Vedas declare in that the other is bound up
through that maya.
4:10. Know then Prakriti (nature) is Maya (art), and the
great Lord the Mayin (maker); the whole world
is filled with what are his members.
4:11. If a man has discerned him, who being one only,
rules over every germ (cause), in whom all this
comes together and comes asunder again, who is the
lord, the bestower of blessing, the adorable god, then
he passes for ever into that peace.
4:12. He, the creator and supporter of the gods, Rudra,
the great seer, the lord of all, who saw
Hiranyagarbha being born, may he endow us with good
thoughts.
4:13. He who is the sovereign of the gods, he in whom all
the worlds rest, he who rules over all twofooted and four-footed beings, to that god let us sacrifice
an oblation.
4:14. He who has known him who is more subtile than
subtile, in the midst of chaos, creating all things,
having many forms, alone enveloping everything, the
happy one (Siva), passes into peace for ever.
4:15. He also was in time the guardian of this world, the
lord of all, hidden in all beings. In him the
Brahmarshis and the deities are united, and he who
knows him cuts the fetters of death asunder.
4:16. He who knows Siva (the blessed) hidden in all
beings, like the subtile film that rises from out the
clarified butter, alone enveloping everything, he who
knows the god, is freed from all fetters.
4:17. That god, the maker of all things, the great Self,
always dwelling in the heart of man, is perceived
by the heart, the soul, the mind; they who know it
become immortal. 
4:18. When the light has risen, there is no day, no night,
neither existence nor non-existence; Siva (the
blessed) alone is there. That is the eternal, the adorable
light of Savitri, and the ancient wisdom
proceeded thence.
4:19. No one has grasped him above, or across, or in the
middle. There is no image of him whose name
is Great Glory.
4:20. His form cannot be seen, no one perceives him
with the eye. Those who through heart and mind
know him thus abiding in the heart, become immortal.
4:21. `Thou art unborn,' with these words some one
comes near to thee, trembling. O Rudra, let thy
gracious face protect me for ever!
4:22. O Rudra! hurt us not in our offspring and
descendants, hurt us not in our own lives, nor in our
cows, nor in our horses! Do not slay our men in thy
wrath, for, holding oblations, we call on thee always.

~ Chapter 5 ~
Fifth Adhyaya
5:1. In the imperishable and infinite Highest Brahman,
wherein the two, knowledge and ignorance, are
hidden, the one, ignorance, perishes, the other,
knowledge, is immortal; but he who controls both,
knowledge and ignorance, is another.
5:2. It is he who, being one only, rules over every germ
(cause), over all forms, and over all germs; it is
he who, in the beginning, bears in his thoughts the wise
son, the fiery, whom he wishes to look on while
he is born.
5:3. In that field in which the god, after spreading out one
net after another in various ways, draws it
together again, the Lord, the great Self, having further
created the lords, thus carries on his lordship over 
all.
5:4. As the car (of the sun) shines, lighting up all
quarters, above, below, and across, thus does that god,
the holy, the adorable, being one, rule over all that has
the nature of a germ.
5:5. He, being one, rules over all and everything, so that
the universal germ ripens its nature, diversifies
all natures that can be ripened, and determines all
qualities.
5:6. Brahma (Hiranyagarbha) knows this, which is hidden
in the Upanishads, which are hidden in the
Vedas, as the Brahma-germ. The ancient gods and
poets who knew it, they became it and were immortal.
5:7. But he who is endowed with qualities, and performs
works that are to bear fruit, and enjoys the
reward of whatever he has done, migrates through his
own works, the lord of life, assuming all forms, led
by the three Gunas, and following the three paths.
5:8. That lower one also, not larger than a thumb, but
brilliant like the sun, who is endowed with
personality and thoughts, with the quality of mind and the
quality of body, is seen small even like the
point of a goad.
5:9. That living soul is to be known as part of the
hundredth part of the point of a hair, divided a hundred
times, and yet it is to be infinite.
5:10. It is not woman, it is not man, nor is it neuter;
whatever body it takes, with that it is joined (only).
5:11. By means of thoughts, touching, seeing, and
passions the incarnate Self assumes successively in
various places various forms, in accordance with his
deeds, just as the body grows when food and drink
are poured into it.
5:12. That incarnate Self, according to his own qualities,
chooses (assumes) many shapes, coarse or
subtile, and having himself caused his union with them,
he is seen as another and another, through the 
qualities of his acts, and through the qualities of his body.
5:13. He who knows him who has no beginning and no
end, in the midst of chaos, creating all things,
having many forms, alone enveloping everything, is freed
from all fetters.
5:14. Those who know him who is to be grasped by the
mind, who is not to be called the nest (the body),
who makes existence and non-existence, the happy one
(Siva), who also creates the elements, they have
left the body.

~ Chapter 6 ~
Sixth Adhyaya
6:1. Some wise men, deluded, speak of Nature, and
others of Time (as the cause of everything); but it is
the greatness of God by which this Brahma-wheel is
made to turn.
6:2. It is at the command of him who always covers this
world, the knower, the time of time, who
assumes qualities and all knowledge, it is at his command
that this work (creation) unfolds itself, which is
called earth, water, fire, air, and ether;
6:3. He who, after he has done that work and rested
again, and after he has brought together one essence
(the self) with the other (matter), with one, two, three, or
eight, with time also and with the subtile
qualities of the mind,
6:4. Who, after starting the works endowed with (the
three) qualities, can order all things, yet when, in
the absence of all these, he has caused the destruction of
the work, goes on, being in truth different (from
all he has produced);
6:5. He is the beginning, producing the causes which
unite (the soul with the body), and, being above the
three kinds of time (past, present, future), he is seen as
without parts, after we have first worshipped that 
adorable god, who has many forms, and who is the true
source (of all things), as dwelling in our own
mind.
6:6. He is beyond all the forms of the tree (of the world)
and of time, he is the other, from whom this
world moves round, when one has known him who brings
good and removes evil, the lord of bliss, as
dwelling within the self, the immortal, the support of all.
6:7. Let us know that highest great lord of lords, the
highest deity of deities, the master of masters, the
highest above, as god, the lord of the world, the adorable.
6:8. There is no effect and no cause known of him, no
one is seen like unto him or better; his high power
is revealed as manifold, as inherent, acting as force and
knowledge.
6:9. There is no master of his in the world, no ruler of his,
not even a sign of him. He is the cause, the
lord of the lords of the organs, and there is of him neither
parent nor lord.
6:10. That only god who spontaneously covered himself,
like a spider, with threads drawn from the first
cause (pradhana), grant us entrance into Brahman.
6:11. He is the one God, hidden in all beings, allpervading, the self within all beings, watching over all
works, dwelling in all beings, the witness, the perceiver,
the only one, free from qualities.
6:12. He is the one ruler of many who (seem to act, but
really do) not act; he makes the one seed
manifold. The wise who perceive him within their self, to
them belongs eternal happiness, not to others.
6:13. He is the eternal among eternals, the thinker
among thinkers, who, though one, fulfils the desires of
many. He who has known that cause which is to be
apprehended by Sankhya (philosophy) and Yoga
(religious discipline), he is freed from all fetters.
6:14. The sun does not shine there, nor the moon and
the stars, nor these lightnings, and much less this 
fire. When he shines, everything shines after him; by his
light all this is lightened.
6:15. He is the one bird in the midst of the world; he is
also (like) the fire (of the sun) that has set in the
ocean. A man who knows him truly, passes over death;
there is no other path to go.
6:16. He makes all, he knows all, the self-caused, the
knower, the time of time (destroyer of time), who
assumes qualities and knows everything, the master of
nature and of man, the lord of the three qualities
(guna), the cause of the bondage, the existence, and the
liberation of the world.
6:17. He who has become that, he is the immortal,
remaining the lord, the knower, the ever-present
guardian of this world, who rules this world for ever, for no
one else is able to rule it.
6:18. Seeking for freedom I go for refuge to that God who
is the light of his own thoughts, he who first
creates Brahman (m.) and delivers the Vedas to him;
6:19. Who is without parts, without actions, tranquil,
without fault, without taint, the highest bridge to
immortality like a fire that has consumed its fuel.
6:20. Only when men shall roll up the sky like a hide, will
there be an end of misery, unless God has first
been known.
6:21. Through the power of his penance and through the
grace of God has the wise Svetasvatara truly
proclaimed Brahman, the highest and holiest, to the best
of ascetics, as approved by the company of
Rishis.
6:22. This highest mystery in the Vedanta, delivered in a
former age, should not be given to one whose
passions have not been subdued, nor to one who is not a
son, or who is not a pupil.
6:23. If these truths have been told to a high-minded
man, who feels the highest devotion for God, and 
for his Guru as for God, then they will shine forth, then
they will shine forth indeed.
Commentary
6:4. Note: These two verses are again extremely
obscure, and the explanations of the commentators throw
little light on the their real, original meaning. To begin
with Sankara, he assumes the subject to be the
same as he at whose command this work unfolds itself,
and explains tattvasya tattvena sametya yogam by
atmano bhumyadina yogam samgamayya. As the eight
Tattvas he gives earth, water, fire, air, ether,
mind, thought, personality, while the Atmagunas are,
according to him, the affections of the mind, love,
anger, &c. In the second verse, however, Sankara
seems to assume a different subject. `If a man,' he says,
`having done works, infected by qualities, should transfer
them on Isvara, the Lord, there would be
destruction of the works formerly done by him, because
there would be no more connection with the self.'
Something is left out, but that this is Sankara's idea,
appears from the verses which he quotes in support,
and which are intended to show that Yogins, transfering
all their acts, good, bad, or indifferent, on
Brahman, are no longer affected by them. `That person,'
Sankara continues, `his works being destroyed
and his nature purified, moves on, different from all things
(tattva), from all the results of ignorance,
knowing himself to be Brahman.' `Or,' he adds, `if we
read anyad, it means, he goes to that Brahman
which is differen from all things.'
Sankarananda takes a different view. He says: `If a man
has performed sacrifices, and has finished them,
or, has turned away from them again as vain, and if he
has obtained union with that which is the real of
the (apparently) real, &c.' The commentator then asks
what is that with which he obtains union, and
replies, `the one, i.e. ignorance; the two, i.e. right and
wrong; the three, i.e. the three colours, red white,
and black; and the eight, i.e. the five elements, with mind,
thought, and personality; also with time, and
with the subtile affections of the mind.' He then goes on,
`If that man, after having begun qualified 
works, should take on himself all states (resulting from
ignorance), yet, when these states cease, there
would be an end of the work, good or bad, done by him,
and when his work has come to an end, he abides
in truth (according to the Veda); while the other, who
differs from the Veda, is wrong.' Sankarananda,
however, evidently feels that this is a doubtful
interpretation, and he suggests another, viz. `If the Lord
himself,' he says, `determined these states (bhava), it
would seem that there would be no end of samsara.
He therefore says, that when these states, ignorance &c.,
cease, the work done by man ceases; and when
the work done ceases, the living soul gets free of
samsara, being in truth another, i.e. different from
ignorance and its products.'
Vignanatman says: `If a man, having done work, turns
away from it, and obtains union of one tattva (the
tvam, or self) with the real tatta (the tat, or the Lord); and
how? By means of the one, i.e. the teaching
of the Guru; the two, i.e. love of the Guru and of the Lord;
the three, i.e. hearing remembering, and
meditating; the eight, i.e. restraint, penance, postures,
regulation of the breath, abstraction, devotion,
contemplation, and meditation (Yoga-sutras II, 29); by
time, i.e. the right time for work; by the qualities
of the self, i.e. pity, &c.; by the subtile ones, i.e. the good
dispositions for knowledge, then (we must
supply) he becomes free.' And this he explains more fully
in the next verse. `If, after having done
qualified works, i.e. works to please the Lord, a Yati
discards all things, and recognises the phenomenal
character of all states, and traces them back to their real
source, the work done ceases also in its effects,
and when the work has been annihilated, he goes to
freedom, being another in truth; or, if we read anyat,
he goes to what is different from all these things, namely,
to the Lord; or, he goes to a state of perfect
lordship in truth, having discovered the highest truth, the
oneness of the self with the Highest Self.'
I think that, judging from the context, the subject is really
the same in both verses, viz. the Lord, as
passing through different states, and at last knowing
himself to be above them all. Yet, the other 
explanations may be defended, and if the subject were
taken to be different in each verse, some difficulties
would disappear.
