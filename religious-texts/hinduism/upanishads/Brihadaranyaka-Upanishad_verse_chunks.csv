1,1,1-2,"Verily the dawn is the head of the horse which is fit for sacrifice, the sun its eye, the wind its breath, the mouth the Vaisvanara fire, the year the body of the sacrificial horse. Heaven is the back, the sky the belly, the earth the chest, the quarters the two sides, the intermediate quarters the ribs, the members the seasons, the joints the months and half-months, the feet days and nights, the bones the stars, the flesh the clouds. The half-digested food is the sand, the rivers the bowels, the liver and the lungs the mountains, the hairs the herbs and trees. As the sun rises, it is the forepart, as it sets, the hindpart of the horse. When the horse shakes itself, then it lightens; when it kicks, it thunders; when it makes water, it rains; voice is its voice. Verily Day arose after the horse as the (golden) vessel, called Mahiman (greatness), which (at the sacrifice) is placed before the horse. Its place is in the Eastern sea. The Night arose after the horse as the (silver) vessel, called Mahiman, which (at the sacrifice) is placed behind the horse. Its place is in the Western sea. Verily, these two vessels (or greatnesses) arose to be on each side of the horse. As a racer he carried the Devas, as a stallion the Gandharvas, as a runner the Asuras, as a horse men. The sea is its kin, the sea is its birthplace."
1,2,1-3,"In the beginning there was nothing (to be perceived) here whatsoever. By Death indeed all this was concealed, by hunger; for death is hunger. Death (the first being) thought, `Let me have a body.' Then he moved about, worshipping. From him thus worshipping water was produced. And he said: `Verily, there appeared to me, while I worshipped (arkate), water (ka).' This is why water is called ar-ka. Surely there is water (or pleasure) for him who thus knows the reason why water is called arka. Verily water is arka. And what was there as the froth of the water, that was hardened, and became the earth. On that earth he (Death) rested, and from him, thus resting and heated, Agni (Virag) proceeded, full of light. That being divided itself threefold, Aditya (the sun)"
1,2,2-4,"Verily water is arka. And what was there as the froth of the water, that was hardened, and became the earth. On that earth he (Death) rested, and from him, thus resting and heated, Agni (Virag) proceeded, full of light. That being divided itself threefold, Aditya (the sun) as the third, and Vayu (the air) as the third. That spirit (prana) became threefold. The head was the Eastern quarter, and the arms this and that quarter (i.e. the N.E. and S.E., on the left and right sides). Then the tail was the Western quarter, and the two legs this and that quarter (i.e. the N.W. and S.W.). The sides were the Southern and Northern quarters, the back heaven, the belly the sky, the dust the earth. Thus he (Mrityu, as arka) stands firm in the water, and he who knows this stands firm wherever he goes. He desired, `Let a second body be born of me,'"
1,2,3-5,"That being divided itself threefold, Aditya (the sun) as the third, and Vayu (the air) as the third. That spirit (prana) became threefold.

The sides were the Southern and Northern quarters, the back heaven, the belly the sky, the dust the earth. Thus he (Mrityu, as arka) stands firm in the water, and he who knows this stands firm wherever he goes. He desired, `Let a second body be born of me,' and he (Death or Hunger) embraced Speech in his mind. Then the seed became the year. Before that time there was no year. Speech bore him so long as a year, and after that time sent him forth. Then when he was born, he (Death) opened his mouth, as if to swallow him. He cried Bhan! and that became speech. He thought, `If I kill him, I shall have but little food.'"
1,2,4-6,"He desired, `Let a second body be born of me,' and he (Death or Hunger) embraced Speech in his mind. Then the seed became the year. Before that time there was no year.

He thought, `If I kill him, I shall have but little food.' He therefore brought forth by that speech and by that body (the year) all whatsoever exists, the Rik, the Yagus, the Saman, the metres, the sacrifices, men, and animals. And whatever he (Death) brought forth, that he resolved to eat (ad). Verily because he eats everything, therefore is Aditi (Death) called Aditi.

And whatever he (Death) brought forth, that he resolved to eat (ad). Verily because he eats everything, therefore is Aditi (Death) called Aditi. He who thus knows why Aditi is called Aditi, becomes an eater of everything, and everything becomes his food. He desired to sacrifice again with a greater sacrifice. He toiled and performed penance. And while he toiled and performed penance, glorious power went out of him. Verily glorious power means the senses (prana). Then when the senses had gone out, the body took to swelling (sva-yitum), and mind was in the body. He desired that this body should be fit for sacrifice"
1,2,6-7,"He desired to sacrifice again with a greater sacrifice. He toiled and performed penance. And while he toiled and performed penance, glorious power went out of him. Verily glorious power means the senses (prana). Then when the senses had gone out, the body took to swelling (sva-yitum), and mind was in the body. He desired that this body should be fit for sacrifice (medhya), and that he should be embodied by it. Then he became a horse (asva), because it swelled (asvat), and was fit for sacrifice (medhya); and this is why the horse-sacrifice is called Asva-medha. Verily he who knows him thus, knows the Asvamedha. Then, letting the horse free, he thought, and at the end of a year he offered it up for himself, while he gave up the (other) animals to the deities. Therefore the sacrificers offered up the purified horse belonging to Pragapati, (as dedicated) to all the deities. Verily the shining sun is the Asvamedha-sacrifice, and his body is the year; Agni is the sacrificial fire (arka), and these worlds are his bodies. These two are the sacrificial fire and the Asvamedha-sacrifice, and they are again one deity, viz. Death. He (who knows this) overcomes another death, death does not reach him, death is his Self, he becomes one of those deities."
1,3,1-3,"There were two kinds of descendants of Pragapati, the Devas and the Asuras. Now the Devas were indeed the younger, the Asuras the elder ones. The Devas, who were struggling in these worlds, said: `Well, let us overcome the Asuras at the sacrifices (the Gyotishtoma) by means of the udgitha.' They said to speech (Vak): `Do thou sing out for us (the udgitha).' `Yes,' said speech, and sang (the udgitha). Whatever delight there is in speech, that she obtained for the Devas by singing (the three pavamanas); but that she pronounced well (in the other nine pavamanas), that was for herself. The Asuras knew: `Verily, through this singer they will overcome us.' They therefore rushed at the singer and pierced her with evil. That evil which consists in saying what is bad, that is that evil.

1,4,1-3,"In the beginning this was Self alone, in the shape of a person (purusha). He looking round saw nothing but his Self. He first said, `This is I;' therefore he became I by name.

Therefore now also a lonely person desires, `Let there be a wife for me that I may have offspring, and let there be wealth for me that I may offer sacrifices.'

When it is said, that `one he gave to animals,' that is milk. For in the beginning (in their infancy) both men and animals live on milk.

No, on the very day on which he sacrifices, on that day he overcomes death again; for he who knows this, offers to the gods the entire food (viz. milk).

Therefore let a man perform one observance only, let him breathe up and let him breathe down, that the evil death may not reach him. And when he performs it, let him try to finish it. Then he obtains through it union and oneness with that deity (with prana)."

Yagnavalkya said: `Take my hand, my friend. We two alone shall know of this; let this question of ours not be (discussed) in public.' Then these two went out and argued, and what they said was karman (work), what they praised was karman, viz. that a man becomes good by good work, and bad by bad work. After that Garatkarava Artabhaga held his peace."
3,3,1-2,"Then Bhugyu Lahyayani asked. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `we wandered about as students, and came to the house of Patankala Kapya. He had a daughter who was possessed by a Gandharva. We asked him, `Who art thou?' and he (the Gandharva) replied: `I am Sudhanvan, the Angirasa.' And when we asked him about the ends of the world, we said to him, `Where were the Parikshitas? Where then were the Parikshitas, I ask thee, Yagnavalkya, where were the Parikshitas?' Yagnavalkya said: `He said to thee, I suppose, that they went where those go who have performed a horse-sacrifice.' He said: `And where do they go who have performed a horse-sacrifice?' Yagnavalkya replied: `Thirty-two journeys of the car of the sun is this world. The earth surrounds it on every side, twice as large, and the ocean surrounds this earth on every side, twice as large. Now there is between them a space as large as the edge of a razor or the wing of a mosquito. Indra, having become a bird, handed them (through the space) to Vayu (the air), and Vayu (the air), holding them within himself, conveyed them to where they dwell who have performed a horse-sacrifice. Somewhat in this way did he praise Vayu indeed. Therefore Vayu (air) is everything by itself, and Vayu is all things together. He who knows this, conquers death.' After that Bhugyu Lahyayani held his peace."
3,4,1-2,"Then Ushasta Kakrayana asked. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `tell me the Brahman which is visible, not invisible, the Self (atman), who is within all.' Yagnavalkya replied: `This, thy Self, who is within all.' `Which Self, O Yagnavalkya, is within all?' Yagnavalkya replied: `He who breathes in the upbreathing, he is thy Self, and within all. He who breathes in the down-breathing, he is thy Self, and within all. He who breathes in the on-breathing, he is thy Self, and within all. He who breathes in the outbreathing, he is thy Self, and within all. This is thy Self, who is within all.' Ushasta Kakrayana said: `As one might say, this is a cow, this is a horse, thus has this been explained by thee. Tell me the Brahman which is visible, not invisible, the Self, who is within all.' Yagnavalkya replied: `This, thy Self, who is within all.' `Which Self, O Yagnavalkya, is within all?' Yagnavalkya replied: `Thou couldst not see the (true) seer of sight, thou couldst not hear the (true) hearer of hearing, nor perceive the perceiver of perception, nor know the knower of knowledge. This is thy Self, who is within all. Everything also is of evil.' After that Ushasta Kakrayana held his peace."
3,5,1-1,"Then Kahola Kaushitakeya asked. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `tell me the Brahman which is visible, not invisible, the Self (atman), who is within all.' Yagnavalkya replied: `This, thy Self, who is within all.' `Which Self, O Yagnavalkya, is within all?' Yagnavalkya replied: `He who overcomes hunger and thirst, sorrow, passion, old age, and death. When desire for sons, wealth, and (new) worlds, they wander about as mendicants. For a desire for sons is desire for wealth, a desire for wealth is desire for worlds. Both these are indeed desires. Therefore let a stand by real strength; after he has done with that strength and learning, he becomes a Muni (a Yogin); and after he has done with what is not the knowledge of a Muni, and with what is the knowledge of a else is of evil.' After that Kahola Kaushitakeya held his peace."
3,6,1-1,"Then Gargi Vakaknavi asked. `Yagnavalkya,' she said, `everything here is woven, like warp and woof, in water. What then is that in which water is woven, like warp and woof?' `In air, O Gargi,' he replied. `In what then is air woven, like warp and woof?' `In the worlds of the sky, O Gargi,' he replied. `In what then are the worlds of the sky woven, like warp and woof?' `In the worlds of the Gandharvas, O Gargi,' he replied. `In what then are the worlds of the Gandharvas woven, like warp and woof?' `In the worlds of Aditya (sun), O Gargi,' he replied. `In what then are the worlds of Aditya (sun) woven, like warp and woof?' `In the worlds of Kandra (moon), O Gargi,' he replied. `In what then are the worlds of Kandra (moon) woven, like warp and woof?' `In the worlds of the Nakshatras (stars), O Gargi,' he replied. `In what then are the worlds of the Nakshatras (stars) woven, like warp and woof?' `In the worlds of the Devas (gods), O Gargi,' he replied. `In what then are the worlds of the Devas (gods) woven, like warp and woof?' `In the worlds of Indra, O Gargi,' he replied. `In what then are the worlds of Indra woven, like warp and woof?' `In the worlds of Pragapati, O Gargi,' he replied. `In what then are the worlds of Pragapati woven, like warp and woof?' `In the worlds of Brahman, O Gargi,' he replied. `In what then are the worlds of Brahman woven, like warp and woof?' Yagnavalkya said: `O Gargi, Do not ask too much, lest thy head should fall off. Thou askest too much about a deity about which we are not to ask too much. Do not ask too much, O Gargi.' After that Gargi Vakaknavi held her peace."
3,7,1-3,"Then Uddalaka Aruni asked. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `we dwelt among the Madras in the houses of Patankala Kapya, studying the sacrifice. His wife was possessed of a Gandharva, and we asked him: ""Who art thou?"" He answered: ""I am Kabandha Atharvana."" And he said to Patankala Kapya and to (us) students: ""Dost thou know, Kapya, that thread by which this world and the other world, and all beings are strung together?"" And Patankala Kapya replied: ""I do not know it, Sir."" He said again to Patankala Kapya and to (us) students: ""Dost thou know, Kapya, that puller (ruler) within (antaryamin), who within pulls (rules) this world and the other world and all beings?"" And Patankala Kapya replied: ""I do not know it, Sir."" He said again to Patankala Kapya and to (us) students: ""He, O Kapya, who knows that thread and him who pulls (it) within, he knows Brahman, he knows the worlds, he knows the Devas, he knows the Vedas, he knows the Bhutas (creatures), he knows the Self, he knows everything."" Thus did he (the Gandharva) say to them, and I know it. If thou, O Yagnavalkya, without knowing that string and the puller within, drivest away those Brahma-cows (the cows offered as a prize to him who best knows Brahman), thy head will fall off.' Yagnavalkya said: `O Gautama, I believe I know that thread and the puller within.' The other said: `Anybody may say, I know, I know. Tell what thou knowest.' Yagnavalkya said: `Vayu (air) is that thread, O Gautama. By air, as by a thread, O Gautama, this world and the other world, and all creatures are strung together. Therefore, O Gautama, people say of a dead person that his limbs have become unstrung; for by air, as by a thread, O Gautama, they were strung together.' The other said: `So it is, O Yagnavalkya.

Thereupon Pratrida said to his father: `Shall I be able to do any\ good to one who knows this, or shall I be able to do him any harm?'

And thus a man who knows this, even if he commits what seems much evil, consumes it all and becomes pure, clean, and free from decay and death.'"
