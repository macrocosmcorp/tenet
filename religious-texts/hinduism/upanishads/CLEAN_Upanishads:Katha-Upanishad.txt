First Adhyaya
Section 1 
First Valli
1-1:1. Vagasravasa, desirous (of heavenly rewards),
surrendered (at a sacrifice) all that he possessed. He
had a son of the name of Nakiketas.
1-1:2. When the (promised) presents were being given
(to the priests), faith entered into the heart of
Nakiketas, who was still a boy, and he thought:
1-1:3. `Unblessed, surely, are the worlds to which a man
goes by giving (as his promised present at a
sacrifice) cows which have drunk water, eaten hay, given
their milk, and are barren.'
1-1:4. He (knowing that his father had promised to give
up all that he possessed, and therefore his son
also) said to his father: `Dear father, to whom wilt thou
give me?'
He said it a second and a third time. Then the father
replied (angrily):
`I shall give thee unto Death.'
(The father, having once said so, though in haste, had to
be true to his word and to sacrifice his son.)
1-1:5. The son said: `I go as the first, at the head of
many (who have still to die); I go in the midst of
many (who are now dying). What will be the work of
Yama (the ruler of the departed) which to-day he
has to do unto me?
1-1:6. `Look back how it was with those who came
before, look forward how it will be with those who
come hereafter. A mortal ripens like corn, like corn he
springs up again.'
(Nakiketas enters into the abode of Yama Vaivasvata,
and there is no one to receive him. Thereupon one
of the attendants of Yama is supposed to say:)
1-1:7. `Fire enters into the houses, when a Brahmana
enters as a guest. That fire is quenched by this 
peace-offering; bring water, O Vaivasvata!
1-1:8. `A Brahmana that dwells in the house of a foolish
man without receiving food to eat, destroys his
hopes and expectations, his possessions, his
righteousness, his sacred and his good deeds, and all his
sons
and cattle.'
(Yama, returning to his house after an absence of three
nights, during which time Nakiketas had
received no hospitality from him, says:)
1-1:9. `O Brahmana, as thou, a venerable guest, hast
dwelt in my house three nights without eating,
therefore choose now three boons. Hail to thee! and
welfare to me!'
1-1:10. Nakiketas said: `O Death, as the first of the three
boons I choose that Gautama, my father, be
pacified, kind, and free from anger towards me; and that
he may know me and greet me, when I shall
have been dismissed by thee.'
1-1:11. Yama said: `Through my favour Auddalaki Aruni,
thy father, will know thee, and be again
towards thee as he was before. He shall sleep peacefully
through the night, and free from anger, after
having seen thee freed from the mouth of death.'
1-1:12. Nakiketas said: `In the heaven-world there is no
fear; thou art not there, O Death, and no one is
afraid on account of old age. Leaving behind both hunger
and thirst, and out of the reach of sorrow, all
rejoice in the world of heaven.'
1-1:13. `Thou knowest, O Death, the fire-sacrifice which
leads us to heaven; tell it to me, for I am full of
faith. Those who live in the heaven-world reach
immortality, this I ask as my second boon.'
1-1:14. Yama said: `I tell it thee, learn it from me, and
when thou understandest that fire-sacrifice which
leads to heaven, know, O Nakiketas, that it is the
attainment of the endless worlds, and their firm support,
hidden in darkness.'salvation 
1-1:15. Yama then told him that fire-sacrifice, the
beginning of all the worlds, and what bricks are
required for the altar, and how many, and how they are to
be placed. And Nakiketas repeated all as it had
been told to him. Then Mrityu, being pleased with him,
said again:
1-1:16. The generous, being satisfied, said to him: `I give
thee now another boon; that fire-sacrifice shall
be named after thee, take also this many-coloured chain.'
1-1:17. `He who has three times performed this Nakiketa
rite, and has been united with the three (father,
mother, and teacher), and has performed the three duties
(study, sacrifice, almsgiving) overcomes birth
and death. When he has learnt and understood this fire,
which knows (or makes us know) all that is born
of Brahman, which is venerable and divine, then he
obtains everlasting peace.'
1-1:18. `He who knows the three Nakiketa fires, and
knowing the three, piles up the Nakiketa sacrifice,
he, having first thrown off the chains of death, rejoices in
the world of heaven, beyond the reach of grief.'
1-1:19. `This, O Nakiketas, is thy fire which leads to
heaven, and which thou hast chosen as thy second
boon. That fire all men will proclaim. Choose now, O
Nakiketas, thy third boon.'
1-1:20. Nakiketas said: `There is that doubt, when a man
is dead, some saying, he is; others, he is not.
This I should like to know, taught by thee; this is the third
of my boons.'
1-1:21. Death said: `On this point even the gods have
doubted formerly; it is not easy to understand.
That subject is subtle. Choose another boon, O
Nakiketas, do not press me, and let me off that boon.'
1-1:22. Nakiketas said: `On this point even the gods
have doubted indeed, and thou, Death, hast declared
it to be not easy to understand, and another teacher like
thee is not to be found: surely no other boon is
like unto this.' 
1-1:23. Death said: `Choose sons and grandsons who
shall live a hundred years, herds of cattle,
elephants, gold, and horses. Choose the wide abode of
the earth, and live thyself as many harvests as thou
desirest.'
1-1:24. `If you can think of any boon equal to that,
choose wealth, and long life. Be (king), Nakiketas, on
the wide earth. I make thee the enjoyer of all desires.'
1-1:25. `Whatever desires are difficult to attain among
mortals, ask for them according to thy wish;
these fair maidens with their chariots and musical
instruments, such are indeed not to be obtained by
men, be waited on by them whom I give to thee, but do
not ask me about dying.'
1-1:26. Nakiketas said: `These things last till tomorrow, O
Death, for they wear out this vigour of all the
senses. Even the whole of life is short. Keep thou thy
horses, keep dance and song for thyself.'
1-1:27. `No man can be made happy by wealth. Shall
we possess wealth, when we see thee? Shall we
live, as long as thou rulest? Only that boon (which I have
chosen) is to be chosen by me.'
1-1:28. `What mortal, slowly decaying here below, and
knowing, after having approached them, the
freedom from decay enjoyed by the immortals, would
delight in a long life, after he has pondered on the
pleasures which arise from beauty and love?'
1-1:29. `No, that on which there is this doubt, O Death,
tell us what there is in that great Hereafter.
Nakiketas does not choose another boon but that which
enters into the hidden world.'
Section 2
Second Valli
1-2:1. Death said: `The good is one thing, the pleasant
another; these two, having different objects, chain 
a man. It is well with him who clings to the good; he who
chooses the pleasant, misses his end.'
1-2:2. `The good and the pleasant approach man: the
wise goes round about them and distinguishes them.
Yea, the wise prefers the good to the pleasant, but the
fool chooses the pleasant through greed and
avarice.'
1-2:3. `Thou, O Nakiketas, after pondering all pleasures
that are or seem delightful, hast dismissed them
all. Thou hast not gone into the road that leadeth to
wealth, in which many men perish.'
1-2:4. `Wide apart and leading to different points are
these two, ignorance, and what is known as
wisdom. I believe Nakiketas to be one who desires
knowledge, for even many pleasures did not tear thee
away.'
1-2:5. `Fools dwelling in darkness, wise in their own
conceit, and puffed up with vain knowledge, go
round and round, staggering to and fro, like blind men led
by the blind.'"blind lead blind
1-2:6. `The Hereafter never rises before the eyes of the
careless child, deluded by the delusion of wealth.
"This is the world," he thinks, "there is no other;" thus he
falls again and again under my sway.'
1-2:7. `He (the Self) of whom many are not even able to
hear, whom many, even when they hear of him,
do not comprehend; wonderful is a man, when found,
who is able to teach him (the Self); wonderful is he
who comprehends him, when taught by an able teacher.'
1-2:8. `That (Self), when taught by an inferior man, is not
easy to be known, even though often thought
upon; unless it be taught by another, there is no way to it,
for it is inconceivably smaller than what is
small.'
1-2:9. `That doctrine is not to be obtained by argument,
but when it is declared by another, then, O
dearest, it is easy to understand. Thou hast obtained it
now; thou art truly a man of true resolve. May we 
have always an inquirer like thee!'
1-2:10. Nakiketas said: `I know that what is called a
treasure is transient, for that eternal is not obtained
by things which are not eternal. Hence the Nakiketa fire(sacrifice) has been laid by me (first); then, by
means of transient things, I have obtained what is not
transient (the teaching of Yama).'
1-2:11. Yama said: `Though thou hadst seen the
fulfilment of all desires, the foundation of the world, the
endless rewards of good deeds, the shore where there is
no fear, that which is magnified by praise, the
wide abode, the rest, yet being wise thou hast with firm
resolve dismissed it all.'
1-2:12. `The wise who, by means of meditation on his
Self, recognises the Ancient, who is difficult to be
seen, who has entered into the dark, who is hidden in the
cave, who dwells in the abyss, as God, he indeed
leaves joy and sorrow far behind.'
1-2:13. `A mortal who has heard this and embraced it,
who has separated from it all qualities, and has
thus reached the subtle Being, rejoices, because he has
obtained what is a cause for rejoicing. The house
(of Brahman) is open, I believe, O Nakiketas.'
1-2:14. Nakiketas said: `That which thou seest as neither
this nor that, as neither effect nor cause, as
neither past nor future, tell me that.'
1-2:15. Yama said: `That word (or place) which all the
Vedas record, which all penances proclaim,
which men desire when they live as religious students,
that word I tell thee briefly, it is Om.'
1-2:16. `That (imperishable) syllable means Brahman,
that syllable means the highest (Brahman); he
who knows that syllable, whatever he desires, is his.'
1-2:17. `This is the best support, this is the highest
support; he who knows that support is magnified in
the world of Brahma.'
1-2:18. `The knowing (Self) is not born, it dies not; it
sprang from nothing, nothing sprang from it. The
Ancient is unborn, eternal, everlasting; he is not killed,
though the body is killed.'
1-2:19. `If the killer thinks that he kills, if the killed thinks
that he is killed, they do not understand; for
this one does not kill, nor is that one killed.'
1-2:20. `The Self, smaller than small, greater than great,
is hidden in the heart of that creature. A man
who is free from desires and free from grief, sees the
majesty of the Self by the grace of the Creator.'
1-2:21. `Though sitting still, he walks far; though lying
down, he goes everywhere. Who, save myself, is
able to know that God who rejoices and rejoices not?'
1-2:22. `The wise who knows the Self as bodiless within
the bodies, as unchanging among changing
things, as great and omnipresent, does never grieve.'
1-2:23. `That Self cannot be gained by the Veda, nor by
understanding, nor by much learning. He whom
the Self chooses, by him the Self can be gained. The
Self chooses him (his body) as his own.'
1-2:24. `But he who has not first turned away from his
wickedness, who is not tranquil, and subdued, or
whose mind is not at rest, he can never obtain the Self
(even) by knowledge.'
1-2:25. `Who then knows where He is, He to whom the
Brahmans and Kshatriyas are (as it were) but
food, and death itself a condiment?'
Section 3
Third Valli
1-3:1. `There are the two, drinking their reward in the
world of their own works, entered into the cave (of
the heart), dwelling on the highest summit (the ether in
the heart). Those who know Brahman call them
shade and light; likewise, those householders who
perform the Trinakiketa sacrifice.' 
1-3:2. `May we be able to master that Nakiketa rite which
is a bridge for sacrificers; also that which is the
highest, imperishable Brahman for those who wish to
cross over to the fearless shore.'
1-3:3. `Know the Self to be sitting in the chariot, the body
to be the chariot, the intellect (buddhi) the
charioteer, and the mind the reins.'
1-3:4. `The senses they call the horses, the objects of
the senses their roads. When he (the Highest Self)
is in union with the body, the senses, and the mind, then
wise people call him the Enjoyer.'
1-3:5. `He who has no understanding and whose mind
(the reins) is never firmly held, his senses (horses)
are unmanageable, like vicious horses of a charioteer.'
1-3:6. `But he who has understanding and whose mind is
always firmly held, his senses are under
control, like good horses of a charioteer.'
1-3:7. `He who has no understanding, who is unmindful
and always impure, never reaches that place, but
enters into the round of births.'reincarnation
1-3:8. `But he who has understanding, who is mindful
and always pure, reaches indeed that place, from
whence he is not born again.'reincarnation
1-3:9. `But he who has understanding for his charioteer,
and who holds the reins of the mind, he reaches
the end of his journey, and that is the highest place of
Vishnu.'
1-3:10. `Beyond the senses there are the objects,
beyond the objects there is the mind, beyond the mind
there is the intellect, the Great Self is beyond the
intellect.'
1-3:11. `Beyond the Great there is the Undeveloped,
beyond the Undeveloped there is the Person
(purusha). Beyond the Person there is nothing this is
the goal, the highest road.'salvation 
1-3:12. `That Self is hidden in all beings and does not
shine forth, but it is seen by subtle seers through
their sharp and subtle intellect.'
1-3:13. `A wise man should keep down speech and
mind; he should keep them within the Self which is
knowledge; he should keep knowledge within the Self
which is the Great; and he should keep that (the
Great) within the Self which is the Quiet.'
1-3:14. `Rise, awake! having obtained your boons,
understand them! The sharp edge of a razor is
difficult to pass over; thus the wise say the path (to the
Self) is hard.'
1-3:15. `He who has perceived that which is without
sound, without touch, without form, without decay,
without taste, eternal, without smell, without beginning,
without end, beyond the Great, and
unchangeable, is freed from the jaws of death.'
1-3:16. `A wise man who has repeated or heard the
ancient story of Nakiketas told by Death, is magnified
in the world of Brahman.'
1-3:17. `And he who repeats this greatest mystery in an
assembly of Brahmans, or full of devotion at the
time of the Sraddha sacrifice, obtains thereby infinite
rewards.'

Second Adhyaya
Section 4
Fourth Valli
2-4:1. Death said: `The Self-existent pierced the
openings (of the senses) so that they turn forward:
therefore man looks forward, not backward into himself.
Some wise man, however, with his eyes closed
and wishing for immortality, saw the Self behind.' 
2-4:2. `Children follow after outward pleasures, and fall
into the snare of wide-spread death. Wise men
only, knowing the nature of what is immortal, do not look
for anything stable here among things
unstable.'
2-4:3. `That by which we know form, taste, smell,
sounds, and loving touches, by that also we know what
exists besides. This is that (which thou hast asked for).'
2-4:4. `The wise, when he knows that that by which he
perceives all objects in sleep or in waking is the
great omnipresent Self, grieves no more.'
2-4:5. `He who knows this living soul which eats honey
(perceives objects) as being the Self, always near,
the Lord of the past and the future, henceforward fears no
more. This is that.'
2-4:6. `He who (knows) him who was born first from the
brooding heat (for he was born before the
water), who, entering into the heart, abides therein, and
was perceived from the elements. This is that.'
2-4:7. `(He who knows) Aditi also, who is one with all
deities, who arises with Prana (breath or
Hiranyagarbha), who, entering into the heart, abides
therein, and was born from the elements. This is
that.'
2-4:8. `There is Agni (fire), the all-seeing, hidden in the
two fire-sticks, well-guarded like a child (in the
womb) by the mother, day after day to be adored by men
when they awake and bring oblations. This is
that.'
2-4:9. `And that whence the sun rises, and whither it
goes to set, there all the Devas are contained, and
no one goes beyond. This is that.'
2-4:10. `What is here (visible in the world), the same is
there (invisible in Brahman); and what is there,
the same is here. He who sees any difference here
(between Brahman and the world), goes from death to
death.' 
2-4:11. `Even by the mind this (Brahman) is to be
obtained, and then there is no difference whatsoever.
He goes from death to death who sees any difference
here.'
2-4:12. `The person (purusha), of the size of a thumb,
stands in the middle of the Self (body?), as lord of
the past and the future, and henceforward fears no more.
This is that.'
2-4:13. `That person, of the size of a thumb, is like a light
without smoke, lord of the past and the future,
he is the same to-day and to-morrow. This is that.'
2-4:14. `As rain-water that has fallen on a mountain-ridge
runs down the rocks on all sides, thus does he,
who sees a difference between qualities, run after them
on all sides.'
2-4:15. `As pure water poured into pure water remains
the same, thus, O Gautama, is the Self of a thinker
who knows.'
Section 5
Fifth Valli
2-5:1. `There is a town with eleven gates belonging to
the Unborn (Brahman), whose thoughts are never
crooked. He who approaches it, grieves no more, and
liberated (from all bonds of ignorance) becomes
free. This is that.'
2-5:2. `He (Brahman) is the swan (sun), dwelling in the
bright heaven; he is the Vasu (air), dwelling in
the sky; he is the sacrificer (fire), dwelling on the hearth;
he is the guest (Soma), dwelling in the
sacrificial jar; he dwells in men, in gods (vara), in the
sacrifice (rita), in heaven; he is born in the water,
on earth, in the sacrifice (rita), on the mountains; he is the
True and the Great.'
2-5:3. `He (Brahman) it is who sends up the breath
(prana), and who throws back the breath (apana). All
the Devas (senses) worship him, the adorable (or the
dwarf), who sits in the centre.' 
2-5:4. `When that incorporated (Brahman), who dwells in
the body, is torn away and freed from the body,
what remains then? This is that.'
2-5:5. `No mortal lives by the breath that goes up and by
the breath that goes down. We live by another,
in whom these two repose.'
2-5:6. `Well then, O Gautama, I shall tell thee this
mystery, the old Brahman, and what happens to the
Self, after reaching death.'
2-5:7. `Some enter the womb in order to have a body, as
organic beings, others go into inorganic matter,
according to their work and according to their knowledge.'
2-5:8. `He, the highest Person, who is awake in us while
we are asleep, shaping one lovely sight after
another, that indeed is the Bright, that is Brahman, that
alone is called the Immortal. All worlds are
contained in it, and no one goes beyond. This is that.'
2-5:9. `As the one fire, after it has entered the world,
though one, becomes different according to
whatever it burns, thus the one Self within all things
becomes different, according to whatever it enters,
and exists also without.'
2-5:10. `As the one air, after it has entered the world,
though one, becomes different according to
whatever it enters, thus the one Self within all things
becomes different, according to whatever it enters,
and exists also without.'
2-5:11. `As the sun, the eye of the whole world, is not
contaminated by the external impurities seen by the
eyes, thus the one Self within all things is never
contaminated by the misery of the world, being himself
without.'
2-5:12. `There is one ruler, the Self within all things, who
makes the one form manifold. The wise who
perceive him within their Self, to them belongs eternal
happiness, not to others.' 
2-5:13. `There is one eternal thinker, thinking non-eternal
thoughts, who, though one, fulfils the desires
of many. The wise who perceive him within their Self, to
them belongs eternal peace, not to others.'
2-5:14. `They perceive that highest indescribable
pleasure, saying, This is that. How then can I
understand it? Has it its own light, or does it reflect light?'
2-5:15. `The sun does not shine there, nor the moon and
the stars, nor these lightnings, and much less
this fire. When he shines, everything shines after him; by
his light all this is lighted.'
Section 6
Sixth Valli
2-6:1. `There is that ancient tree, whose roots grow
upward and whose branches grow downward; that
indeed is called the Bright, that is called Brahman, that
alone is called the Immortal. All worlds are
contained in it, and no one goes beyond. This is that.'
2-6:2. `Whatever there is, the whole world, when gone
forth (from the Brahman), trembles in its breath.
That Brahman is a great terror, like a drawn sword.
Those who know it become immortal.'
2-6:3. `From terror of Brahman fire burns, from terror the
sun burns, from terror Indra and Vayu, and
Death, as the fifth, run away.'
2-6:4. `If a man could not understand it before the falling
asunder of his body, then he has to take body
again in the worlds of creation.'
2-6:5. `As in a mirror, so (Brahman may be seen clearly)
here in this body; as in a dream, in the world of
the Fathers; as in the water, he is seen about in the world
of the Gandharvas; as in light and shade, in the
world of Brahma.'
2-6:6. `Having understood that the senses are distinct
(from the Atman), and that their rising and setting 
(their waking and sleeping) belongs to them in their
distinct existence (and not to the Atman), a wise man
grieves no more.'
2-6:7. `Beyond the senses is the mind, beyond the mind
is the highest (created) Being, higher than that
Being is the Great Self, higher than the Great, the highest
Undeveloped.'
2-6:8. `Beyond the Undeveloped is the Person, the allpervading and entirely imperceptible. Every
creature that knows him is liberated, and obtains
immortality.'
2-6:9. `His form is not to be seen, no one beholds him
with the eye. He is imagined by the heart, by
wisdom, by the mind. Those who know this, are
immortal.'
2-6:10. `When the five instruments of knowledge stand
still together with the mind, and when the
intellect does not move, that is called the highest state.'
2-6:11. `This, the firm holding back of the senses, is what
is called Yoga. He must be free from
thoughtlessness then, for Yoga comes and goes.'
2-6:12. `He (the Self) cannot be reached by speech, by
mind, or by the eye. How can it be apprehended
except by him who says: "He is?"'
2-6:13. `By the words "He is," is he to be apprehended,
and by (admitting) the reality of both (the
invisible Brahman and the visible world, as coming from
Brahman). When he has been apprehended by
the words "He is," then his reality reveals itself.'
2-6:14. `When all desires that dwell in his heart cease,
then the mortal becomes immortal, and obtains
Brahman.'
2-6:15. `When all the ties of the heart are severed here
on earth, then the mortal becomes immortal
here ends the teaching.'
2-6:16. `There are a hundred and one arteries of the
heart, one of them penetrates the crown of the head.
Moving upwards by it, a man (at his death) reaches the
Immortal; the other arteries serve for departing in
different directions.'
2-6:17. `The Person not larger than a thumb, the inner
Self, is always settled in the heart of men. Let a
man draw that Self forth from his body with steadiness, as
one draws the pith from a reed. Let him know
that Self as the Bright, as the Immortal; yes, as the Bright,
as the Immortal.'
2-6:18. Having received this knowledge taught by Death
and the whole rule of Yoga (meditation),
Nakiketa became free from passion and death, and
obtained Brahman. Thus it will be with another also
who knows thus what relates to the Self.
2-6:19. May He protect us both! May He enjoy us both!
May we acquire strength together! May our
knowledge become bright! May we never quarrel!
Om! Peace! peace! peace! Harih, Om!
